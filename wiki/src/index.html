Tails is a [[!wikipedia live_CD]] or [[!wikipedia live_USB]] that aims at
preserving your <strong>privacy</strong> and <strong>anonymity</strong>.<br/>
It helps you to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>use the Internet anonymously</strong> almost anywhere you go and on
    any computer:<br/>
    all connections to the Internet are forced to go through [[the Tor
    network|https://www.torproject.org/]];
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>leave no trace</strong> on the computer you're using unless
    you ask it explicitly.
  </li>
</ul>
