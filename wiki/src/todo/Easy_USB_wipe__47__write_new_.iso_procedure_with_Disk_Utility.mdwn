If the System Administration utility Disk Utility (on Ubuntu 10.10 is version 2.30.1 2004-2009 Red Hat, Inc.) is added to TAILS, then it is easy to update an existing USB flash drive with a new .iso in a few steps:

1) Run Disk Utility with the USB plugged into a Linux Live CD/USB session.  Find the USB to be reformatted and burned with the new TAILS .iso. and remember its device name, /dev/sdx where x is a an alphabet letter.

2) Locate the top window pane in the Disk Utility window.

3) Click on Format Drive, and choose (click) on Don't partition, and then Format.  This will wipe the USB and ready it for burning the new TAILS .iso.

4) From the root account or from issuing the command:
    $ sudo -i
to get the root account's prompt:
    #
issue the command:
    # dd if=<path-to-TAILS-.iso> of=/dev/sdx
where x is replaced by an alphabet letter which does not include a numeral [0-9] at the end, a partition, but the entire device name from the top window of Disk Utility.

Note: root access is required to mount any hard drive containing the downloaded/verified TAILS .iso from which to run the dd command above.
