When running `@vm.execute("pgrep -f $something")` it's currently the
case that `pgrep` lists its own pid (and hence never fails, which
could be of great importance), unlike when you run it natively, and
unlike "The running pgrep or pkill process will never report itself as
a match." in `pgrep(1)`.

The practical problem is the (potentially serious) surprise one can be
hit by when writing a step definition.

Why is that happening? Are other tools misbehaving?

Having a look in the `pgrep` sources may help us understand this issue.
