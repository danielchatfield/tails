[CIA.vc is
dead](http://shadowm.rewound.net/blog/archives/245-CIA.vc-is-dead.html). It
would be good to find another way to have commits announced to the IRC
channels.

`repo.or.cz` which was used to send updates to CIA is also able to trigger
HTTP post compatible with HTTP post compatible with [GitHub
webhooks](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks).
[gitbot](https://github.com/thedjinn/gitbot) is a fairly trivial bot
written in Ruby that receives these kind of commit notifications and
write them on an IRC channel.

Other options: [irker](http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/) and
[KGB](http://kgb.alioth.debian.org/). Both needs to be able to set custom
post-receive hooks in the repository. This is not the easiest as our
repositories are currently hosted by boum.org and immerda.ch.

Next steps
==========

## Gitbot

[[!taglink todo/sysadmin]]

Disable the (currently useless) GitBot we run a GitBot on
autobuild.tails.boum.org since repo.or.cz does not support
notifications for mirror projects. (It does not look that hard to add
this feature to their software, but we were not able to get an
up-to-date copy thereof after 2 emails and 5 weeks, so this does not
look viable a solution.)

## immerda

Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] a few weeks for immerda to have migrated
to Gitolite and seen if they can plug KGB or irker into
their infrastructure.

If this does not work, we could research for a third-party to offer
either the "IRC notification reacting on GitHub webhooks" service or
the full "monitor Git repositories and notify on IRC" one.

Or we could host the whole set of our own Git repositories ourselves,
so that we can use KGB or irker.
