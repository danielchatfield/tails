[CIA.vc is
dead](http://shadowm.rewound.net/blog/archives/245-CIA.vc-is-dead.html). It
would be good to find another way to have commits announced to the IRC
channels.

`repo.or.cz` which was used to send updates to CIA is also able to trigger
HTTP post compatible with HTTP post compatible with [GitHub
webhooks](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks).
[gitbot](https://github.com/thedjinn/gitbot) is a fairly trivial bot
written in Ruby that receives these kind of commit notifications and
write them on an IRC channel.

Other options: [irker](http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/) and
[KGB](http://kgb.alioth.debian.org/). Both needs to be able to set custom
post-receive hooks in the repository. This is not the easiest as our
repositories are currently hosted by boum.org and immerda.ch.

Next steps
==========

We run a GitBot on autobuild.tails.boum.org. repo.or.cz is configured
to push notifications to it. Let's see if it works and if the result
is good enough.

Or we could [[!taglink todo/research]] for a third-party to offer
either the "IRC notification reacting on GitHub webhooks" service
or the full "monitor Git repositories and notify on IRC" one.

Or we could host the whole set of our own Git repositories ourselves,
so that we can use KGB or irker.
