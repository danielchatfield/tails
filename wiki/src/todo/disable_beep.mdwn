For discretion matters, we've been suggested to disable the PC speaker
beep.

As [documented in the Debian
Reference](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch09.en.html#_disabling_beep_sounds),
the standard way to do so is to remove / blacklist the `pcspkr`
kernel module.

Browsing through Ubuntu's /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf it can be seen that `pcspkr` is blacklisted by default, [referring to a bug #77010](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/karmic/+source/linux/+bug/77010) for more info.

Many advices applicable to Debian are [ documented on Arch Linux wiki ](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Disable_the_PC_speaker_beep). Although, concerning ALSA, "Beep" is muted by default in Tails.


Blacklisting PC Speaker (adding `blakclist pcspkr` line to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf) module seems like the best solution.
