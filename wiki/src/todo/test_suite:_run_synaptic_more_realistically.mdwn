Synaptic should be started from the applications menu, or at least we
should make sure it's started in exactly the same way as it is run by
the `.desktop` by extracting that command-line from the `.desktop`
(e.g. on Wheezy, this will be `synaptic-pkexec`).

See `step_definitions/unsafe_browser.rb` for a very similar example.
