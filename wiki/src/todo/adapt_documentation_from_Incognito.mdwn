The
[Incognito's
documentation](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/usr/share/incognito/)
has been imported.

We now need to adapt it. This work have started in the `doc-rework` branch, in
which the walkthrough is migrated into Tails doc/ section. Out-of-sync sections
are marked as outdated and need adaptation.
