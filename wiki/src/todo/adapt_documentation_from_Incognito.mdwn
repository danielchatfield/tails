The
[Incognito's
documentation](https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/incognito/trunk/root_overlay/usr/share/incognito/)
has been imported.

Left to do:

* we've moved [[todo/autorun_in_Windows]] to [[wishlist]],
  so [[doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/tails_within_windows]]
  should be dropped. [[!tag todo/documentation]]

Off-topic here:

* [[doc/anonymous_internet/thunderbird]]:
  now tracked on [[todo/Return of Icedove?]]

[[!tag release/1.0]]
