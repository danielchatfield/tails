This is what's said about [BetterPrivacy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6623)
in the [Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#recommendedextensions):

> Better Privacy is an excellent extension that protects you from
  cookies used by Flash applications, which often persist forever and
  are not clearable via normal Firefox "Private Data" clearing. Flash
  and all other plugins are disabled by Torbutton by default, but if
  you are interested in privacy, you may want this extension to allow
  you to inspect and automatically clear your Flash cookies for your
  Non-Tor usage.

Hence, if we ever include a flash plugin (not adobe's proprietary
blob, but something like lightspark, gnash, swfdec etc.), this may be
a very important addon.
