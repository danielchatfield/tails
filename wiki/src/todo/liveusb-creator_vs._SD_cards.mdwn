In order to install Tails on an SD card, you must use a USB SDCard reader. This way Tails sees the SD card as a USB device.
 
Using integrated SD card readers is problematic and not supported.

Once Tails has been installed on the SDCard, it should be bootable if the hardware supports booting from SD.

Roadmap
=======

[[!tag todo/code]]

* Modify `liveusb/creator.py` to accept `sdio` as well as `usb`:

	iface = str(dev.Get(device, 'DriveConnectionInterface'))
	if iface != 'usb' and self.opts.force != data['device']:

* Hack liveusb/creator to avoid filtering out non-removable devices
  when they're connected to a `sdio` interface.
