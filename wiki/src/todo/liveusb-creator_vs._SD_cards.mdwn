Maybe does not support SD / SDHC Cards as well as USB yet?

Tried on one internal SD card reader, and the SD card was recognized
just like a removable USB stick -- the card reader probably was wired
as USB internally.

But this is not always the case: e.g. some other SD cards are handled
by the `mmc_block` (Multimedia Card (MMC) block device driver) module,
e.g. when plugged into:

	15:00.2 SD Host controller: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 21)

Roadmap
=======

[[!taglink todo/research]] what udisks "DriveConnectionInterface" is
exposed by such SD card readers, and change `liveusb/creator.py`
accordingly around these lines:

	iface = str(dev.Get(device, 'DriveConnectionInterface'))
	if iface != 'usb' and self.opts.force != data['device']:

[[!tag release/2.0]]
