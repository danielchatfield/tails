Persistence of client certicicates in the browser would make their use a lot easier

The same approach than with bookmarks seems to be working. Candidate files are `key3.db` and/or `cert8.db` and/or `secmod.db` (<http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/db_formats.html>). These filenames seems to be subject to change without a notice.

Another approach would be to use `pk12util` (from `nss3-tools` package, see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS/Tools>) to import client cert (<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS/tools/NSS_Tools_pk12util>). See also `certutils` to import certificates (<http://wiki.wmtransfer.com/projects/webmoney/wiki/Installing_personal_certificate_in_Mozilla_Firefox> : <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS_reference/NSS_tools_:_certutil>)
