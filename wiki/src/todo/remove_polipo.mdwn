polipo has painful bugs, Tails has transparent Tor-ification and
torified DNS resolution, and Torbutton 1.3.x has a "I'm using a
transparent firewall-based torifying setup" => we could simply remove
polipo.

This should probably be thought trough and discussed a bit more.

If we use the transparent proxy, then we don't use our firewall as a fallback
anymore but as the only stuff we rely on so the traffic goes to Tor. This
doesn't sounds safe.

Decision is to [[!taglink todo/wait]] until iceweasel (5.0 probably)
which [fixes SOCKS
support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661) is
available on Glandium's APT repository (see [[todo/Iceweasel_4.x]].
