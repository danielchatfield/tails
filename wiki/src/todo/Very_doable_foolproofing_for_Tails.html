I like to see things as simple as possible. Just make it so things are automatically safe. 

Say the user leaves Tails on, and someone else finds it running with their information (things like this can happen)? 

I would love to see a script that starts the shutdown/wipe sequence as soon as the computer has been left untouched (just detect no mouse/keyboard activity) for a certain time, say 15 minutes. That way even if you forgot to turn it off, you have a failsafe. That would be very powerful foolproofing, especially for less advanced users!

Here is an example tiny program that does this in windows:
