Due to Vidalia's [[!tor_bug 2150]] and [[!tor_bug 1247]] we restart
vidalia after network (re-)connection.

We're waiting until one of these bugs is fixed upstream.

Moving to an event-based init will also probably allow us to only
start Tor once the network is up, and eliminate one of the causes for
restarting Tor and Vidalia.
