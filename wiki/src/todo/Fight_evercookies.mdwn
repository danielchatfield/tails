The web browser in Tails 0.9 was subject to evercookies, both after
closing the browser and after using Torbutton's new identity feature:
[test site](http://samy.pl/evercookie/).

We should test if the TBB has the same problem, and possible solutions.

Testing reports
===============

0.10.2
------

iceweasel 10.0.2, noscript 2.1.4-1, torbutton 1.4.5.1-1

### samy.pl

Upon cookie creation, this website once reports it manages to store
identifying bits in (cookieData, windowData, pngData, etagData,
pngData).

* Clicking the Torbutton *New identity* button => the website
  is kinda reliably able to rediscover the cookie.
* Restarting the browser => the website is *not* able to
  rediscover the cookie.

pre-0.11 experimental branch
----------------------------

iceweasel 11, noscript 2.1.4-1, torbutton 1.4.5.1-1

### samy.pl

Upon cookie creation, this website reports it manages to store
identifying bits sometimes in (cookieData, windowData, pngData),
sometimes in (cookieData, pngData, cacheData).

* Clicking the Torbutton *New identity* button => the website
  generally is not able to rediscover the cookie, but it was *once*:
  buggy test?
* Restarting the browser => the website is *not* able to
  rediscover the cookie.

[[!tag todo/done]] in 0.10.2 and later.
