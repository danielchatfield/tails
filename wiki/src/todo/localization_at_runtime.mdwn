Add an Incognito-like boot menu to choose the language at runtime,
instead of building per-language images.

Implementation
==============

* use our custom *amnesiabranding* iceweasel extension to localize at runtime:
  - the homepage: done
  - the default search engine: done
* [[!taglink todo/research]] how many Debian localization packages fit
  on one CD:
  - 500kB for each `iceweasel-l10n-*`
  - 7MB for each `openoffice.org-l10n-*`
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-hyphenation-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
  - ??MB for each `openoffice.org-thesaurus-*`: many languages are
    only in >= Squeeze
* implement a language-choosing boot menu: done (ugly hack,
  [[!taglink todo/wait]] for live-helper upstream to provide a nice
  gfxboot-based language choosing menu)
* [[!taglink todo/translate]] the nautilus-wipe menu entry, in
  `chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/autostart-localize`
* [[!taglink todo/translate]] the desktop launchers in
  `config/chroot_local-includes/home/amnesia/Desktop/*.desktop`
* [[!taglink todo/research]] how to properly support Chinese and
  Russian languages; others? have a look to tasksel's
  chinese-s-desktop, arabic-desktop, and so on for fonts, input
  systems, etc.
* enable supported languages to be [[translated|tags/todo/translate]]
  in the wiki, once we get to reach trusted translators/reviewers; we
  don't want to ship misleading instructions.

Miscellaneous ideas
===================

* Additionally go on supporting building pre-localized images?
* Remember the chosen locale when using a writable boot device?
  (needs discussion, this breaks the "no persistence unless
  explicitly told" requirement): [[!taglink todo/discuss]]
