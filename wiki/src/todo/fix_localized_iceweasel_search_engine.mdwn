In Tails 0.18, choosing German in tails-greeter => iceweasel has
Google configured as the default search engine. No localized Startpage
is available. "Startpage HTTPS" is available. Wikipedia is available,
while it's normally only shown in English locales.

No localized search engine (from
`/etc/iceweasel/searchplugins/locale/$LOCALE`) is available.

It's as if the localized search engines were picked when the profile
is generated at build time, then used forever: when logged in German,
`~/.mozilla/firefox/default/search.json` contains `"locale":"en-US"`
and references `/etc/iceweasel/searchplugins/locale/en-US`, but not
its `de` counterpart. However, there is no `search.json` in
`/etc/skel/.mozilla/firefox/default`.

Could it be that `intl.locale.matchOS` is overridden by the way we now
set `general.useragent.*`?

Same at least for Spanish and French. Added to 0.18's known issues.
