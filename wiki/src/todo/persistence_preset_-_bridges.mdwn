It would be great to be able to have persistent Tor bridges settings.


##### Comments:
1. This makes sense. If a user wants to use only bridges to connect to the Tor network it makes sense to be able to store their bridges as a persistence option. I currently save my bridges in a text file in the persistent storage and manually enter them into Vidalia, and use the "bridge" parameter when tails first starts booting. There seem to be problems with tordate and tor not connecting quickly enough for the tordate script(s) when using bridges.
