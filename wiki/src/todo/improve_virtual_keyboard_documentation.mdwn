See [[doc/encryption_and_privacy/virtual_keyboard]].

- Mention software keyloggers too?
- Until [[todo/Add_a_virtual_keyboard_in_Tails_Greeter]] is
  implemented, maybe warn that password created with Tails greeter can
  be captured by a *hardware* keylogger.
- Add link on documentation about keyloggers.
- Include Florence screenshot and desktop icon.
- Rename the page to mention explicitly the virtual keyboard.
