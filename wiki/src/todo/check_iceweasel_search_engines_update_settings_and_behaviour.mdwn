>Downloading icons?
>>I suspect that's right.

`browser.chrome.site_icons` is already set to false anyway, as it should be.

Still happening in 0.16 and the 0.17 pre-release.

Setting `browser.chrome.site_icons`, `browser.chrome.favicons` and
`browser.chrome.image_icons.max_size` in `user.js` instead of the
site-wide `iceweasel.js` does not solve the problem.

It seems Iceweasel only connects to www.google.com and
en.wikipedia.org, that are (coincidence?) the only two engines without
an icon in the search bar at startup time. A few seconds later, they
get their icon, presumably downloaded from the Internet.

See [[bugs/Iceweasel_contacts_all_search_providers_on_startup]].
