Translations of WhisperBack [and
others](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6902#comment:1)
are now handled in Tor's Transifex. Our [[translation
instructions|contribute/how/translate]] must take this into account.

We must make it clear to potential translators that interacting
with Transifex is not the same as interacting with Tails.
