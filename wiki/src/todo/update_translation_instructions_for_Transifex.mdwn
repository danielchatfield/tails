Translations of many custom Tails programs
are now handled in Tor's Transifex. Our [[translation
instructions|contribute/how/translate]] takes this into account.

**Left to do**:

1. Adapt [[contribute/how/translate]] to match the fact that we can't
   use both Git and Transifex for a given language.
   - See this
     [thread](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2013-March/000449.html)
     on tails-l10n, and especially [this
     post](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2013-April/000507.html).
   - Work is being done in the `doc/either_git_or_transifex` branch.
1. We must make it clear to potential translators that interacting
   with Transifex is not the same as interacting with Tails.
