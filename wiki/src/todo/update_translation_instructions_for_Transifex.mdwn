Translations of many custom Tails programs
are now handled in Tor's Transifex. Our [[translation
instructions|contribute/how/translate]] takes this into account.

**Done**:

1. Adapt [[contribute/how/translate]] to match the fact that we can't
   use both Git and Transifex for a given language (done in the
   `doc/either_git_or_transifex` branch). See this
   [thread](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2013-March/000449.html)
   on tails-l10n, and especially [this
   post](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2013-April/000507.html).
1. We must make it clear to potential translators that interacting
   with Transifex is not the same as interacting with Tails.
1. Add to the [Tor translation
   instructions](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/translation/Introduction)
   a short blurb about Tails, Transifex, and Git which points to [[our
   documentation|contribute/how/translate]].
