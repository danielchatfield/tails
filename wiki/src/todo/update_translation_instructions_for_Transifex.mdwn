Translations of many custom Tails programs
are now handled in Tor's Transifex. Our [[translation
instructions|contribute/how/translate]] takes this into account.

**Left to do**:

We must make it clear to potential translators that interacting
with Transifex is not the same as interacting with Tails.

We should invite the people translating custom programs with git to check [Torproject's repository](https://gitweb.torproject.org/translation.git) for updated versions. Those translations are [automatically updated](https://gitweb.torproject.org/translation-tools.git/tree) from Transifex every 30 minutes.

On the Transifex side, we may add a message for the translators, pointing to contribute/how/translate and the Tails-l10n mailing-list.
