This step is actually a bit error prone. As this feature has to run on
fast VM, this step often fails if the Tails VM has more memory than
the default, as the VM takes long time to do the memory wiping on
shutdown (perticulary in nested VM setup).

This `Shutdown Tails` step seems to be used only in this feature and
the memory wiping one. Maybe we could have 2 different ways to
shutdown the machine, and in the case of this feature, simply use a
`@vm.destroy`.
