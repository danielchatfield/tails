Rationale
=========

* Git becomes sluggish, mainly due to binary and source Debian
  packages we've been storing in Git.
* We've never taken advantage of mixing website with sources,
  so we only experience the disadvantages of it.

Our plan
========

New Git repositories
--------------------

... with history imported and rewritten to filter out parts that were
splitted out:

* `tails-live.git`: the Tails source code we feed live-build with
* `tails-website.git`: the source of this website (i.e. more or less
  what is currently in `wiki/src`

APT repository
--------------

Current stateÂ : see the [[dedicated page|contribute/APT_repository]].

We have imported binary and source packages from our Git repository
for past releases (completed on 2012-11-14).

Let's say the not-merged-yet branches will see their packages imported
as they are worked on.

.mrconfig
---------

A few teams, such as the debian-installer and Debian Perl ones, that
use many Git repositories (thousands, in case of the latter), have
been successfully using [[!debpkg mr]] to make an initial checkout
easier for new contributors, and generally making it easier to deal
with a lot of repositories (mass-update, etc.). We could do the same,
starting with maintaining and publishing a `.mrconfig` file.

Additional custom repositories we use and may want to include in this
`.mrconfig`: whisperback, live-boot, live-config, vidalia, htp,
tails-greeter.

We probably should ship two mrconfig files: one that uses anonymous
`git://` read-only remotes, the other that uses `ssh://`
read-write remotes.

* [pkg-perl help page](http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org/git.html)

Next things to do
=================

Now that the [[APT repository]] is setup, and old packages imported,
the next steps:

 * migrate the website to its own Git repository;
 * rewriting the `tails-live.git` history without the website
   and without the Debian packages.
