Tails 0.11 boot menu says "Debian Live" and displays a big red
Debian swirl. This has two major drawbacks:

* It is confusing users who boot Tails for the first time and wonder
  why it says "Debian" while they installed "Tails".
* It is very visible to casual observers, and this happens at a time
  *before* one had a chance to enable Windows camouflage mode.

So, we would like a simple black screen with "Tails -- The Amnesic
Incognito Live System" written somewhere in less contrastish a way.

Also:

* say "Boot Tails" instead of "Boot menu"
* replace the "Debian $VERSION" from the blue progress bar by "Tails
  $VERSION"

Implementation
--------------

### Instead of the black background, a splash with less contrastish tails logo

[[!img splash.png]]

I didn't found a way to add a title as text instead of as an image.

Better colors to go with that in stdmenu.cfg:

    menu color sel      *   #ffffffff   #55555555   *
    menu color hotsel   1;7;37;40 #ffffffff #22222222   *

### To say "Boot Tails" instead of "Boot menu"

In syslinux's menu.cfg:

    - menu title Boot menu
    + menu title Boot Tails

Other old implementation ideas
------------------------------

### To have a very simple black background

In syslinux's stdmenu.cfg

    - menu background /syslinux/splash.png
    + menu background     *   #00000000   *   *


### To replace "Debian $VERSION" by "Tails $VERSION" in plymouth text

These are set in the debian pachage sources:

in 'debian/rules':

    dh_auto_configure -- --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var --enable-pango \
        --enable-tracing --disable-tests --disable-gdm-transition \
        --with-system-root-install --without-rhgb-compat-link \
        --with-gdm-autostart-file \
        --with-release-file=/etc/debian_version \
        --with-logo=/usr/share/plymouth/debian-logo.png \
        --with-background-color=0x005a8a

and in 'debian/patches/01-parse-etc-debian_version.patch':

    -   if (!pos) goto out;

    -out:

        free(buf);
     }

So to change it we have to build a custom package, using
'--with-release-file=/etc/amnesia/version' in 'debian/rules' and something to
get the 1st field of the 1st line of 'buf' in the patch.
