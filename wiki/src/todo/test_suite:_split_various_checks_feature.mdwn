As currently implemented, `checks.feature` mixes various unrelated
checks for the sole reason of improving the test suite runtime.
Unfortunately, this is deemed to result in a quickly growing
bitrot space.

Instead, the scenarii that are currently in there should be split into
functionally grouped independent features, that would share a tag
expressing that they can share a common background snapshot.
