Currently the persistence setup creates a persistent volume with an ext3 filesystem. However ext4 brings some new features, most notably the "extents" feature, that makes it a much more attractive choice for flash based media such as USB sticks.

Then performing some common file system operations, such as deleting large files, ext4 will write much less data to the disk than ext3 does [0]. This lowers the wear on the flash memory, and increases the response time when working with files.

Implementing this is probably as simple as changing the "ext3" occurence in "Setup.pm" to "ext4". Not tested. But if manually formatting with ext4, Tails already works flawlessy using ext4 on the persistent volume.
