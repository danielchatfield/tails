When moved to a VM, the Gitolite setup should be Puppet'ized.

Candidate modules:

* [blt's](https://github.com/blt/puppet-gitolite): nicely use debconf
  preseeding, but does not handle more than the package installation
  and first-time config
* [hunner's](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/hunner/gitolite): maybe
  overkill, maybe not
