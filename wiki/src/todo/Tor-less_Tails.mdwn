The Tails distro is a very good Linux distro apart from the tor bundle. I find myself using it even when I don't need tor.  And I like using Tails better than Ubuntu. I know I could download Debian but Debian is not as polished as Tails; in addition, debian seems kinda raw and is not as usuable out of the box like Tails is. Could you please make a version of Tails without all the security and lock-down stuff. You really have something good here that might be able to compete head-to-head with some of the other distros out there like Linux Mint and Ubuntu.

Please seriously consider & I dont believe I am alone in this desire.
