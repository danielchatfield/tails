# To reproduce this bug

- setup persistence;
- reboot and activate it read-only;
- start `tails-persistence-setup`.

# Result

`tails-prsistence-setup` then allows you to modify settings of the
persistence, but doesn't actually save them.

# Desired result

Actually save the modification, of refuse to launch the assistant with an
explicit message.
