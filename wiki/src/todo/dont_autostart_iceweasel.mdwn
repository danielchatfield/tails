Specification
=============

It was reported that iceweasel autostarting is suboptimal: its startup
timing is a bit weird wrt. the session startup:  depending on many
parameters, it pops up at a unexpected time, in a way that surprises
many users ("oh, what's happening?!") and makes the Tails UX
seemingly random.

The main reason why we autostart iceweasel was to make it clear to the
user when Tor is ready enough to browse the web.

So, I propose we replace iceweasel autostart with a "Tor is now
ready!" desktop notification.

However, once we don't autostart iceweasel, many users will probably
click its launcher in the GNOME panel at various times in the time
sync' process, so we should have this launcher start a wrapper that
accordingly warns if Tor is not ready yet, before allowing starting
the browser anyway (because currently, this is the browser that should
be used to reach the LAN, so users should be able to use it offline).

Implementation
==============

To end with, if we implement this, the profiling script should
probably be adapted to wait for another process.

> The profiling script was actually just waiting some time

The feature is implemented in branch `feature/dont_autostart_iceweasel`.

Next setps:

- [[!taglink todo/code]] adapt the testsuite ("Iceweasel has autostarted and is
  not loading a web page" at least)

[[!tag priority/elevated]]
