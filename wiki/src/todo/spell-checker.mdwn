We now have a [[todo/boot_menu]], support many languages and go beyond
the 700MB limit, so we can install the software and dictionaries
needed to get the spell-checker feature working at least in iceweasel,
Gedit, and OpenOffice.

Data points:

 - openoffice and libreoffice use hunspell
 - gedit uses the Enchant library, that itself supports hunspell and
   aspell
 - iceweasel indiscriminately uses myspell and hunspell dictionaries

The `feature/spell-checker` branch installs the hunspell (when
available) and myspell (else) dictionary for every language listed in
the default language dropbox in tails-greeter.
