Think what our threat model is. Make it explicit at least in the
[[design]] part of our documentation.

Draft
=====

Network-wise I guess we assume the same type of threat that tor does --
an non-global adversary which has full control over the network traffic
of some fraction(s) of the Internet.

We in addition also assume that our adversary can physically attack
the user's computer:

1. the adversary might raid the user at any moment and then confiscate
   and analyse the equipment, storage media and memory in particular.
2. the adversary might be physically monitoring the computer while
   T(A)ILS is running on it.
