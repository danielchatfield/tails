Rationale
=========

The volume TailsData shows up in the Places menu but when clicking
  on it I get "Unable to mount TailsData /dev/dm-0 is mounted". I guess
  that's no big surprise but then it should either be removed from the
  Places menu or open the folder where it is mounted
 (/live/persistent/sdb2_unlocked) if we think that makes sense.

Solution
========

Udisks introduces an udev property for that purpose. From `man 7 udisks`:

> UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE
> 
> If set to 1 this is a hint to presentation level software that the
> device should not be shown to the user.

This should be applied to partitions with label (`UDISKS_PARTITION_LABEL`)
`TailsData`.

This issue should be solved in branch `bugfix/hide_TailsData_volume`.

Perliminary testing:

- Doens't work for me straight after creating persistent volume with
  `tails-persistence-setup`
- Works for me once rebooted with persistence activated
