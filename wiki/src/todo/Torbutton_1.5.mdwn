# Roadmap

1. [[!taglink todo/discuss]] if we want to ship Torbutton
   1.5.0~pre-alpha-1 in Tails 0.17, or do the work to ship
   a newer one.

# Problem description

Not-released-yet Torbutton 1.5 code has been merged in their master
branch. Preliminary snasphots can be downloaded from
https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/>.

Our current `devel` and `testing` branches install a month old
snapshot of Torbutton (1.5.0~pre-alpha-1).

In the meanwhile, Torbutton and TBB have changed quite a lot they way
they handle Firefox preferences. When we want to install a newer
1.5~pre Torbutton, then we have to update quite a lot of how we
configure Iceweasel in Tails:

* We have to disable the Browser-based update notification
  ([[!tor_bug 7495]] and [[!tor_bug 6156]])
* We have to migrate to the new Torbutton simplified prefs
  ([[!tor_bug 3100]])
* We perhaps have to fight with Torbutton about the homepage.
* We perhaps have to migrate the way we configure Iceweasel to
  TBB's new shiny way (`#tor.js` and `extension-overrides.js`).

On the other hand, it does not look like any of the changes after
1.5.0pre (19fb6d91c..dbe7b143e) actually fix or improve any protection
offered by Torbutton to Tails users, so it does not look critical to
upgrade in a hurry this late in the 0.17 release cycle.

Quoting Mike Perry:

* [about our branding extension] so I am not sure how you want to
  handle updating the default browser prefs. we also went with an ugly
  hack there of shoving a #tor.js pref file next to firefox.js
* I wonder if that same thing can be done from your branding
  extension.. I'm sort of surprised you're able to overwrite browser
  default prefs from there. I didn't think that was normally possible
  from extensions
  - here's our pref file for Tor Browser:
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/erinn/torbrowser.git/blob/bug3944-erinn:/build-scripts/config/pound_tor.js>
  - and here's our new extensions-overrides file:
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/erinn/torbrowser.git/blob/bug3944-erinn:/build-scripts/config/extension-overrides.js>
  - here's the makefile hacks to shove the browser prefs into place:
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/erinn/torbrowser.git/blob/bug3944-erinn:/build-scripts/linux-alpha.mk#l468>
  - and likewise for the extension overrides:
    <https://gitweb.torproject.org/erinn/torbrowser.git/blob/bug3944-erinn:/build-scripts/linux-alpha.mk#l323>
  - those two changes make it so our default pref values are now
    actually defaults in about:config
* I also cleaned up and reduced number of prefs we set
* oh, we also moved away from auto socksport.. we chose 9150 for
  socks, and 9151 for control port.. you may need to tweak that.
* and you want to build FF with --disable-webrtc
