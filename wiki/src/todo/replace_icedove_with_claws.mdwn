For better privacy, and to ease the implementation of
[[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]], icedove is being replaced with
claws-mail.

Done
====

- stop installing icedove and enigmail packages
- install claws packages with pgp plugins
- change the `desktop/gnome/url-handlers/mailto` gconf setting to use
  claws instead of icedove
- $HOME: replace icedove icon in Gnome panel with Claws' one
- $HOME: basic configuration (see [[todo/applications_audit/claws_mail]])

Left to do
==========

- [[!taglink todo/test]]
- refresh `squashfs.sort` [[!tag todo/code]]
