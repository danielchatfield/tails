A `sleep` that's good enough on your hardware might not be good enough
on mine (or in a nested VM setup in particular). We need to, whenever
possible, use reliable ways to detect the state we are waiting for
instead of `sleep`:ing some fixed time and hoping we've reached that
state by then.

Just run `git grep sleep features/step_definitions/*.rb` for an
up-to-date list of these "violations".
