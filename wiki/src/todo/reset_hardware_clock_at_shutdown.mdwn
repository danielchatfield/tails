Changing the hardware clock is a change to the hardware, and as such
goes against the whole "let's not leave any traces on the hardware
unless the user OKs it" thing.

Tails should avoid doing this:

* either change the system time without changing the hardware clock
* or reset the hardware clock, at shutdown time, to the the old
  time offset

> does not change the hardware clock. So it seems like this is not
> a real bug. Closing.
