Changing the hardware clock is a change to the hardware, and as such
goes against the whole "let's not leave any traces on the hardware
unless the user OKs it" thing.

Tails should reset the hardware clock, at shutdown time, to the the
old time offset.

But first of all, we must [[!taglink todo/test]] if Tails actually
changes the hardware clock.
