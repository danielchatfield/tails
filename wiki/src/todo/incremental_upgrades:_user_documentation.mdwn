Users must be explained how to download and install an Incremental
Upgrade Kit.

Missing pages:

* `doc/upgrade/error/get_update_description`: the user is pointed to
  this page when the update-description file cannot be downloaded or
  verified
* `doc/upgrade/error/get_target_file`: the user is pointed to this
  page when a target file file cannot be downloaded or verified
* `doc/upgrade/error/install_iuk`: the user is pointed to this page
  when the installation of a downloaded IUK failed This page should be
  about what to do in this case. My Tails may be left in a broken
  state, as long as I am told what broke, and explained how to repair
  it (possibly by re-installing from scratch, or by performing a full
  update).
