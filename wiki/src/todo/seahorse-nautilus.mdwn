For Wheezy, we'll want to backport [[!debpkg seahorse-nautilus]]
(currently in NEW, ITP: [[!debbug 668221]]).

Upstream: <https://launchpad.net/seahorse-nautilus>

The [Ubuntu package for `seahorse-nautilus`
3.7.5](http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/seahorse-nautilus) can be
installed and works on Wheezy.

There's also a command-line tool `seahorse-tool` in the same package.

Asymmetric encryption: ok
=========================

  - There is a menu item "Encrypt..." below "Compress..."
  - Double-click on the file also works
  - The key selection window is a bit tiny by default. It really
    looks like the one from GPG Applet. But this one doesn't have the "Trust"
    column.
  - Encryption works: it creates a file with .pgp extension

Signing: ok
===========

  - There is a menu item "Sign" below "Encrypt..."
  - Works: creates a detached signature with .sig extension
  - It is also possible to sign while doing asymmetric encryption

Signature check: missing
========================

  - No menu entry to check a signature (either selecting only the detached
    signature or both the original file and the detached signature)
  - There is signature checking in seahorse-tool.
  - The notification is far from ideal (doens't show keyid nor fingerprint and disappears quickly).
  - <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/seahorse-nautilus/+bug/995623>

Asymmetric decryption: ok
=========================

 - Works: the menu item is on top of the list "Open with Decrypt
   file"
 - Asks where to save the file

Symmetric encryption: missing
=============================

  - Not available
  - `seahorse-tool` does not do symmetric encryption either

Symmetric decryption: could be improved
=======================================

  - "Open with Decrypt File" or double-click managed to open an armored message
    with symmetric encryption
  - When decrypting such a message, a first dialog with "Encryption passphrase"
    appears, followed by another dialog "Decrypting" which takes away the focus
    from the passphrase dialog. That's annoying.

Support for multiple identities
===============================

  - There is a "Sign as" drop list when signing
