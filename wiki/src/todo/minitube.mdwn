minitube is a native YouTube client. It is in Debian ([[!debpts
minitube]]) (6MB compressed .deb files), but won't be in Wheezy due to
the version in testing at the time of the freeze being incompatible
with the latest Youtube API ([[!debbug 673696]]). The version in sid
at the time of this writing (1.9-1) is easily backported for
Squeeze, though.

# Roadmap

We have a `feature/minitube` branch that installs a minitube backport.
It works fine.

* [[!taglink todo/upstream]] Alessandro's patch to make minitube use SOCKS.
  (We'd like to stop shipping a HTTP proxy
  entirely, so adding applications than rely on it may not be great.)
* [[!taglink todo/discuss]] if the search suggestion feature is blocker
* [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Jacob to audit Minitube for anonymity
  issues: [[!tor_bug 8064]]
* Once convinced we want minitube in Tails, write user and design documentation.

# Design

According to Alessandro Grassi's
[audit](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002430.html),
the search history is only used to display past searches under the
search box, so it should not have any adverse effects in Tails threat model.
