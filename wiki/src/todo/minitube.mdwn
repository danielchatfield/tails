minitube is a native YouTube client. It is in Debian ([[!debpts
minitube]]) (6MB compressed .deb files), but won't be in Wheezy due to
the version in testing at the time of the freeze being incompatible
with the latest Youtube API ([[!debbug 673696]]).

# Roadmap

We have a `feature/minitube` branch that installs a minitube backport.
It works fine.

* [[!taglink todo/upstream]] Alessandro's patch to make minitube use SOCKS.
  (We'd like to stop shipping a HTTP proxy
  entirely, so adding applications than rely on it may not be great.)
* [[!taglink todo/discuss]] if the search suggestion feature is blocker
* [[!taglink todo/research]] the implications of the history feature
* [[!taglink todo/research]]: one should think of other potential security
  issues and anonymity problems.
* [[!taglink todo/test]] if we're affected by Debian bug #666773.
* Once convinced we want minitube in Tails, write user and design documentation.
