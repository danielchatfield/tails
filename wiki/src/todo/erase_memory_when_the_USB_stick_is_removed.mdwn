If running from the USB drive and it is removed, it would be nice to
wipe memory and reboot when the USB drive is removed: if you're in
a persecuted country and they are on to you, you can grab the USB
and leave.

A simple udev rule should do the job. It should be triggered by
`ACTION=="remove"`, and be really careful to detect whether the system
is running from the just-removed USB stick.

The implementation difficulty arises from the fact that smem must be
permanently kept in RAM after boot, along with what's needed to make
the command run by the udev rule work. Possible solution: run smem on
boot, immediately SIGSTOP it, and SIGCONT it when the USB stick
is unplugged.
