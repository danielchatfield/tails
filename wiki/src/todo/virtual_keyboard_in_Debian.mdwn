We [[now ship onBoard|todo/install_a_non-KDE_virtual_keyboard]]
and have a hard time maintaining our custom packages adapted from
Ubuntu's ones.

In order to preserve Tails developers sanity we need to use a decent
virtual keyboard that is shipped by Debian. We've researched which
software would be the best suited one and have decided to move to
Florence.

# Moving to Florence

We've been convinced by Florence (available in squeeze-backports) and
work is ongoing in our `feature/florence` Git branch to replace
onBoard with it.

The `feature/florence` branch was merged into the `devel` branch.

# Alternatives

onBoard
-------

* [homepage](http://launchpad.net/onboard)
* shipped by Ubuntu
* keyboard layout dynamic learning bug reports:
  [[!lauchpad_bug 65626]], [[!launchpad_bug 391997]].
  These bugs are supposed to be solved in squeeze, but
  there's [[another bug|bugs/Squeeze:_onBoard_is_unusable_with_non-qwerty_keyboard_layout]], probably somewhere in Xorg prevents
  them to work
* there is a notification area icon
* depends on the Python gconf bindings, that are available in Squeeze
  (package `python-gconf`) and in Lenny (package `python-gnome2`)

Florence
--------

* [homepage](http://florence.sourceforge.net/english.html)
* more beautiful than onBoard
* One can launch it with `--no-gnome` to disable the message about
  `gnome-at-spi` at startup. Instead, we enable accessibility features
  at build time, since we also want to enable those.
* find a [[conf file attached|florence.gconf.xml]]
* available in squeeze-backports

Caribou
-------

* [homepage](http://live.gnome.org/Caribou)

kvkbd
-----

* automagically guesses the (localized) keyboard layout from the
  current X config
* needs KDE libs => we switched to onBoard because of this.

matchbox-keyboard
-----------------

* [homepage](http://matchbox-project.org/?p=1)
* packaged for lenny
* misses a gnome panel applet/notification area icon, but it shouldn't be a lot to write, as there is one for matchbox panel provided
* here is a french layout : [[keyboard-fr.xml]]

gok
---

* was not able to get it working

xvbkd
-----

* no dynamic layout loading
* quite ugly
