polipo has painful bugs, Tails has transparent Tor-ification and
torified DNS resolution, and Torbutton 1.3.x has a "I'm using a
transparent firewall-based torifying setup" => we could simply stop
using polipo in Iceweasel right now.

But if we use the transparent proxy, then we don't use our firewall as
a fallback anymore but as the only stuff we rely on so the traffic
goes to Tor. This doesn't sounds safe.

So we decided to wait until [[we ship Iceweasel
5.0|todo/Iceweasel_5.x]] or later, which [fixes SOCKS
support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661).

Side note: since we're not willing to rely on the firewall only for
transparent torification, applications that are not SOCKS-aware still
need to be explicitly torified using the `http_proxy` -style
environment variables, so we cannot entirely remove polipo from Tails.
