Next steps
==========

## Avoid Tails-specific DNS requests

One can see e.g. with Wireshark that the Unsafe Browser sends DNS
requests for `amnesia` and `tails.boum.org` on the network.
This should clearly not happen.

**Next thing to do**: [[!taglink todo/research]] why this happens.

## Improve fingerprint of the request made to get the captive portal

For the WiFi hotspot and probably ISP, the recommended way of using
the Unsafe browser only to login in the portal and then use only Tor
is fingerprintable.

What clearnet request do people do to get the captive portal?

**Next thing to do**: [[!taglink todo/research]] how we can improve
the network fingerprint of that principal usecase.

Done
====

As a first step, we wanted to make the Unsafe Browser look like
a default Debian Iceweasel ESR.
This was done by removing all add-ons.
