iceweasel
=========

## done

### default profile in `/etc/iceweasel/`

We now configure the default profile in `/etc/iceweasel/` rather than
in `$HOME`:

* system-wide preferences can be set in `/etc/iceweasel/pref/iceweasel.js`
* `/etc/iceweasel/profile/` contains a profile skeleton that is copied
  into newly created user profiles.
* bookmarks are configured in `/etc/iceweasel/profile/bookmarks.html`
* extensions that aren't Debian-packaged, when put into
  `/etc/iceweasel/profile/extensions/`, are automatically enabled in
  new profiles - without any annoying message
* no need to resync `$HOME` every time a Debian packaged extension is
  upgraded, in order to avoid the annoying "an extension has been
  upgraded" dialog box

### sqlite

We now have the needed code to generate sqlite files at build time
from plain SQL files dropped into
`config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia/iceweasel/sql/`.

## resources

- [TBB's build
  scripts](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/)
  do a bunch of things that can be very interesting for us

Gnome
=====

We already configure GNOME purely via XML files dropped into
`config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia/gconf/`, that are
loaded at boot time.

[Sabayon](http://live.gnome.org/Sabayon/) is "a system administration
tool to define and deploy desktop profiles for the GNOME
desktop environment." It may very well be fit our needs, but
it is currently (20100213) only available in Debian experimental
(which is explained by [[!debbug 534941]]).
