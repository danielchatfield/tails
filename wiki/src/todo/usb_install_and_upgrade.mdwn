Roadmap
=======

[[!tag todo/code]]

Our plan is to:

1. release something useful based on the work we've already done on
   the basis of Fedora liveusb-creator: **done** in Tails 0.11
2. probably start (again...) from Ubuntu's
   [usb-creator](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator), that has a
   much saner codebase; [[usb_install_and_upgrade/future_spec]]
3. take care of Windows support, partial upgrades, and postponed stuff
   (see the *Later* section on the [[usb_install_and_upgrade/todo]]
   page)

Other useful pages:

* [[what is left to do|usb_install_and_upgrade/todo]]
* [[what we've done so far|usb_install_and_upgrade/done]]
* [[notes about GPT|usb_install_and_upgrade/gpt]]

Our work on liveusb-creator is in a [[dedicated Git
repository|contribute/git]]. Integration work is made in the
`feature/usb_installer` branch in the main Tails Git repository.

Specification
=============

One should be able to easily install Tails to a USB storage device:

* by cloning an existing Tails system that is running from CD or USB;
* running a non-Tails operating system, from a downloaded ISO image.

When upgrading, the installation target may be an existing partition whose content
must be left untouched. The choice between possible destination
devices or partitions must be graphically proposed amongst the
available removable storage devices.

Moreover, at installation time, one should be allowed to setup an
encrypted storage space that can be used by the [[upcoming persistence
features|todo/persistence]]; earliest versions of the installation
program must at least leave room for it so that a later version can be
make use of it. Whether this storage space should better be a second
encrypted partition or a file-backed encrypted FS shall be researched
and decided upon. If the partition way is chosen, the installer
software must have partitioning capabilities.

Research
========

Frontend UI
-----------

See roundup of existing tools at [[todo/usb_install_and_upgrade/archive]].

Unfortunately, no single existing piece of software satisfies the
above specification. It seems like everyone writes their own USB
installer; after the following round-up has been made, this is no
surprise at all: since such tools are designed to be dead easy for the
non-technical end-user, every author selects the few features that are
the most important ones for their intended audience, and generally
writes a very ad-hoc piece of software. Therefore, every Live system
project whose needs are slightly different from the others needs to
write its own USB installer, possibly reinventing more or less wheels
along the road.

We need to see if we can turn one of those tools into something that
satisfies our specification; sadly, proceeding this way *without
forking the existing tool* would probably need more initial
development time than writing a new installer from scratch; we are not
even sure any upstream author of such a software (good enough to be a
possible viable basis) would want to make it more generic and maintain
it this way; on the other hand, if we avoid forking or writing from
scratch, we also avoid maintaining a Tails-specific tool on the long
run.

Booting methods
---------------

Tails [[ships hybrid ISO images|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]]. dd'ing
such a file to a USB stick produces a bootable Tails system but it
overwrites any previously existing partition table. This method is
therefore not suitable for us since it does not satisfy the
"non-destructive upgrade process" requirement.

Two alternatives booting methods have been investigated:

1. **Boot ISO file**: Setup a bootloader on the USB stick that is able
   to boot an ISO image dropped into the right directory of it. Even
   early boot files (kernel, initramfs) are loaded from *inside* the
   ISO file. The bootloader installed on the USB stick can either
   directly boot the kernel from inside the ISO file or chainload the
   ISO image's bootloader. In the first case, until the
   [[todo/boot_menu]] task is completed, the installed boot loader
   must present a boot menu that at least allows the user to choose
   her preferred language.

2. **Copy ISO's content**: Copy needed files (mainly the kernel,
   initramfs and SquashFS image that live in the `live/` directory)
   from the ISO filesystem to the destination partition, then setup a
   bootloader that uses files in that directory. The end result is
   more or less equivalent to dd'ing the ISO image to the USB stick,
   but achieved with a non-destructive process.

We have settled on the *copy ISO's content* way.

See roundup of such techniques, including GRUB2 integration, at
[[todo/usb_install_and_upgrade/archive]].

Partitioning
------------

[udisks](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/udisks) provides a
D-Bus interface that makes it easy to programmatically partition a
storage device and create filesystems in there without messing with
low-level details; its LUKS encryption support probably is the killer
feature that makes it the perfect library for the job.

We have settled on creating GPT partition tables, that allow us to
reliably hide the Tails system partition from Windows' eyes, without
seeing it asking the user to *format an uninitialised volume*.

See [[details and research notes|todo/usb_install_and_upgrade/GPT]]
about it.

Upgrade
=======

One should also be able to easily and non-destructively upgrade a
given Tails system installed on a USB storage device.
Non-destructively means not touching any partition or file other than
the ones managed by the Tails installation system. Proceeding this way
is needed to make it possible using a single USB stick for the Tails
system *and* some persistent storage space.
The upgrade issue is actually twofold: network burden and writing the upgraded
live system on the USB stick.

Full upgrade
------------

Full upgrades happen between major releases, eg. 0.7 and 0.8.

Full upgrades should look as much as possible as a new installs. So it should be
possible to do it from any platform supported by the USB installer.

As for installing, people should be able to provide the ISO to the installer or
ask the installer to download it.

From inside Tails it should also provide an opt-in option to download the full
ISO outside Tor.

Once the upgrade is finished the old ISO is removed automatically from the USB
stick.

Partial upgrade
---------------

Partial upgrades only happen between minor releases, eg. 0.7 and 0.7.1.

See [[todo/incremental_upgrades]].
