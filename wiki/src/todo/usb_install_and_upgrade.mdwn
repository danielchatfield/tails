Roadmap
=======

[[!tag todo/code]]

We have released something useful in Tails 0.11, based on the work we've already done on
the basis of Fedora liveusb-creator.

Next steps are:

Bugfixes and minor improvements of liveusb-creator
--------------------------------------------------

* Remove devices from the list when unplugged.
* Set cursor to waiting (hourglass) state while working.
* *Target Device* list: display more information, such as the stick
  brand and model.
* Allow setting the system/overlay partitions size via command-line
  option(s).
* command-line option --local-hard-disks that would enable
  installation on local hard disks (= not external USB);
  is half-implemented by `--force`, see special casing in the
  detect_removable_devices method.
* Should be more explicit when no target device is available:
  currently displays an empty list, no message, is not that easy to understand.

Incremental upgrades
--------------------

See the dedicated page about [[todo/incremental_upgrades]].

Choose again
------------

Implement our [[specifications|future_spec]] in (probably) Ubuntu's
[usb-creator](https://launchpad.net/usb-creator), that has a much
saner codebase.

This should also open the possibility to take care of, at least, verified
downloads and Windows support.

Resources
