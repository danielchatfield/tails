Pre-UEFI Mac users who have no optical drive cannot
install Tails anymore, due to `isohybrid` being unavailable on their
system (UEFI Apple hardware apparently can't boot Tails anyway).

But actually, the Perl version (`isohybrid.pl`, still shipped as
`/usr/bin/isohybrid.pl` by `syslinux-common` in Wheezy)
[[works at least on some systems|doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/mac]].

1. Call for testing `isohybrid.pl` on more Mac hardware and add
   results to the doc page. The Mac models that were successfully
   tested are listed on the [[Mac installation
   instructions|doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/mac]].
