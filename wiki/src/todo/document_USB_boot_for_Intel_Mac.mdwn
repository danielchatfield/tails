Pre-UEFI Mac users who have no optical drive cannot
install Tails anymore, due to `isohybrid` being unavailable on their
system (UEFI Apple hardware apparently can't boot Tails anyway).

But actually, the Perl version (`isohybrid.pl`, still shipped as
`/usr/bin/isohybrid.pl` by `syslinux-common` in Wheezy) can probably
work on their system:

1. Review the documentation that points these Mac users to
   `isohybrid.pl` [[!tag todo/qa]] (`doc/manual_usb_installation/mac` branch);
   initial work was done in
   <https://github.com/kolohe/amnesia/tree/manual_usb_installation/mac>
1. Call for testing `isohybrid.pl` on more Mac hardware and add
   results to the doc page.
