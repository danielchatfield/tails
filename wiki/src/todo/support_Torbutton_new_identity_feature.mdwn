Torbutton 1.4.1 brings a new identity feature.
It's currently not usable in Tails since Torbutton only supports
ControlPort and password authentication.

We asked upstream for `ControlSocket`:

* [[!tor_bug 3967]] - *minor* as we could trivially re-enable
  `ControlPort`
* `CookieAuthentication` - *blocking* - [[!tor_bug 3968]]) support -
  fixed in Torbutton 1.4.4

> [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.9
