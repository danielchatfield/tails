There are two good reasons for making Tor's data dir persistent:

1. Faster and less wasteful (in terms of bandwidth) bootstrap.
2. Stronger resistence to certain attacks via persistent Entry Guards.

Making `/var/lib/tor` persistent is enough for this, so we should make
a preset for it, and it should be enabled by default.

### Issues

Some of our scripts depend on that certain files in `/var/lib/tor` are
not persistent, which has to be resolved before adding the preset:

* Our time syncing script uses the existence of `cached-descriptors`
  as a test for wheter Tor is working, and a similar assumption is
  made for the `*-consensus` files.
* The Unsafe Browser uses `cached-descriptors` in the same way as the
  time syncing script.
