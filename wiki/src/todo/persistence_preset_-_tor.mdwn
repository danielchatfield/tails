# Big picture

There are a few good reasons for making Tor's data dir persistent:

1. Faster and less wasteful (in terms of bandwidth) bootstrap.
2. Stronger resistance to certain attacks against anonymity via
   persistent Entry Guards.
3. Using Entry Guards makes it harder to detect that you're using Tails.

Making `/var/lib/tor` persistent is enough for this. We should
probably make a preset for it. Should it be enabled by default?

# Issues

## Persistent entry guards vs. mobile users

 using persistent Entry Guards may be problem for mobile users:

## Custom scripts relying on non-persistence

Some of our scripts depend on that certain files in `/var/lib/tor` are
not persistent, which has to be resolved before adding the preset:

* Our time syncing script uses the existence of `cached-descriptors`
  as a test for wheter Tor is working, and a similar assumption is
  made for the `*-consensus` files.
* The Unsafe Browser uses `cached-descriptors` in the same way as the
  time syncing script.

At least "`cached-descriptors` existence checking" can be replaced
with checking "`GETINFO status/circuit-established`" via the
ControlPort.  For tordate's `*-consensus` magic "`GETINFO
status/enough-dir-info`" seems interesting, but isn't a replacement.

Shell function which is useful for the above:

    tor_control_getinfo() {
      COOKIE=/var/run/tor/control.authcookie
      HEXCOOKIE=$(xxd -c 32 -g 0 $COOKIE | cut -d' ' -f2)
      echo -e "AUTHENTICATE $HEXCOOKIE\nGETINFO ${1}\nQUIT" | \
      nc 127.0.0.1 9051 | grep "^250-${1}=" | sed "s@^250-${1}=@@"
    }
