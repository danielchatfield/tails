Shipping `locales-all` would allow us to skip the "compile chosen
locale" step in the login process, which would improve the user
experience by dropping a few seconds lag.

In the initial phase of the tails-greeter development, `locales-all`
was dismissed because we thought it added more than 100MB to the
image size. However, now that we stopped using `localepurge`, that
figure is no longer true.

Building current feature/live-boot-3.x branch with:

- `locales` only: 766M
- `locales-all` only: 775M
- both: 778M

So, it looks like we now can, and probably should, ship `locales-all`
instead of `locales`. Work towards this goal is being done in the `feature/`

Implemented, should be tested a bit and merged into devel.

> Merged in devel, implemented in Tails 0.13.
