Until Tails 0.7.2, the system timezone is set depending on the
language the users chooses at boot time. Currently, Tails Git devel
branch sets UTC timezone for everybody, as an attempt to be consistent
with our trying to put all Tails users into a single anonymity set.

It's not clear if this change is a good idea.

Also, currently, polipo shipped in Tails might [[leak timezone
information|todo/applications_audit/polipo]].

If any TZ leaked and UTC is set, Chinese speakers who use Tails are
singled out from other Chinese speakers. On the other hand, if any TZ
leaked and a language-dependent timezone is set, Chinese speakers who
use Tails are singled out from non-Chinese speakers.

Until now, we've worked towards putting all Tails users into a single
anonymity set, i.e. the Tor users one, and partly into TBB users one,
rather than trying to make a given Tails user appear as any non-Tails
user who happen to speak the same languages as her. Until now, Tails
does not try to conceal the fact it is being used. Shall / can we
reasonably change this?

What does the Tor Browser Bundle do wrt. timezones?
