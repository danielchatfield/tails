Some websites use JavaScript to help determine which fonts are available
on a web browser. Tails browser and the TBB report different fonts as
being available. This difference can be used to distinguish Tails users
from TBB users.

Two tools used show differences between Tails and TBB:

  - <http://ip-check.info/>
    - Tails 0.14~rc2 gets 48 fonts installed.
    - TBB 2.2.39-4 gets 3 fonts installed.

  - <http://www.lalit.org/lab/javascript-css-font-detect/>
    - This one uses the technique described above to check for a set of
      23 common fonts.
    - Tails gets 9 fonts out of 33.
    - TBB gets 33 fonts out of 33, even though some of them are not
      installed on the system.

This is fixed by the branch bugfix/do_not_allow_listing_fonts.
