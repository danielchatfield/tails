The tor system has a lot of lag (understandable) and so I like to read one page (in another tab) while the other one is loading. When I change tabs, though, it seems the browser does not keep trying to get through to the page I clicked on (in the tab I'm not on anymore)as agressively. This often leads to my not getting to pages unless I stay in the tab waiting for it to connect and transfer data. This is taking up a lot of my time waiting for slow pages.
I think I am asking for a setting I can click on disableing the standard behaviour. If such a setting already exists, sorry for not realizing it.
