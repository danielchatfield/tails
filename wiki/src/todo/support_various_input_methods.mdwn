When choosing an input method in "System" --> "Preferences" --> "Input
Method Switcher", one is asked to restart the X session to apply the
chosen settings. This is clearly unusable for most users.

`/usr/share/doc/im-switch/readme.debian.gz` explains in great details
how the input method configuration works.

* What input method do we need to support? SCIM and/or uim and/or IBus?
* Do we have to choose between e.g. uim and IBus?
* How to have `im-switch` do the right thing in function of the
  chosen locale?
* How hard is it to support starting the system in any given locale
  (such as US English), while keeping the possibility of using
  a specific input method (such as SCIM) on demand? (This usecase was
  reported by an actual user.)
