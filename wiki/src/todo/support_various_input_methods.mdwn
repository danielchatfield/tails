When choosing an input method in "System" --> "Preferences" --> "Input
Method Switcher", one is asked to restart the X session to apply the
chosen settings. This is clearly unusable for most users.

Roadmap
=======

1. [[!taglink todo/research]] the questions below in a Wheezy context.

Research
========

`/usr/share/doc/im-switch/readme.debian.gz` explains in great details
how the input method configuration works.

* What input method do we need to support? SCIM and/or uim and/or IBus?
* Do we have to choose between e.g. uim and IBus?
* How to have `im-switch` do the right thing in function of the
  chosen locale?
* How hard is it to support starting the system in any given locale
  (such as US English), while keeping the possibility of using
  a specific input method (such as SCIM) on demand? (This usecase was
  reported by an actual user.)

Resources
=========

* Fedora 19 release notes say they now ship ibus, ibus-kkc,
  ibus-libpinyin and ibus-bogo
* <http://webconverger.org/blog/entry/Restoring_Japanese_support/>
* One user reports that setting up SCIM for Japanese input requires to
  restart X, and is thus hard to do for Tails users.
