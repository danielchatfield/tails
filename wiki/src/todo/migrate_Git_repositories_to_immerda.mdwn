Parent_ticket: [[todo/centralize_Git_repositories]]

[[!tag todo/code]]

Move our repos currently hosted at immerda to the new setup.

For each repository:

* keep our mirrors at repo.or.cz? if yes, then they have to be
  pointed to the new upstream repositories.
* update [[contribute/git]] accordingly
* link to <https://www.immerda.ch/services/certs.html>
* update [[shortcuts]] accordingly
* have immerda delete the old repositories
* send heads up to tails-dev so that everyone updates their config

Repositories left to migrate:

* firegpg
* greeter
* htp
* icedove
* iceweasel
* iuk
* jenkins-jobs
* live-boot
* live-config
* liveusb-creator
* persistence-setup
* tails
* torbutton
* vidalia
* whisperback
