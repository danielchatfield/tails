Parent_ticket: [[todo/centralize_Git_repositories]]

[[!tag todo/code]]

Move our repos currently hosted at immerda to the new setup.

Migrating the master Tails Git repository is a more involved task,
that [[has its own
ticket|todo/migrate_master_Git_repository_to_immerda]].

# Next things to do

Now that all was moved:

* point our mirrors at repo.or.cz to the new upstream repositories
* have riseup delete the old repositories
* have immerda delete the old repositories
* have post-update hook on the master tails repository push to the new
  mirror at immerda
* have Jenkins use the new mirror at immerda (at least in the
  jenkins-jobs repo)
