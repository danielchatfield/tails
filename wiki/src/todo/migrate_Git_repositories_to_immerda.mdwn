Parent_ticket: [[todo/centralize_Git_repositories]]

[[!tag todo/code]]

Move our repos currently hosted at immerda to the new setup.

# How

For each repository:

* update [[contribute/git]] accordingly
* update [[shortcuts]] accordingly
* send heads up to tails-dev so that everyone updates their config

Once all was moved:

* point our mirrors at repo.or.cz to the new upstream repositories
* have riseup delete the old repositories
* have immerda delete the old repositories
