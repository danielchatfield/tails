In order to provide a better alternative to Vidalia's 'New Identity' feature,
see [[todo/disable_Vidalia_new_identity_feature]] we want to provide a fast way
to start the whole Tails session.

A safe way would be to actually reboot the system, we could try to speed up this
process and advertize it well if we want the users to use it well. For example,
there could be a 'Start a new session' button on the Desktop. We could then ask
the user whether to reuse the current Tails-greeter settings and do a reboot
through kexec.

If this solution is not satisfactory in terms of speed, we could also try to
remove, possibly through aufs, all the files modified by this session and start
a new Gnome session and restart the needed services. This solution will probably
be more complicated to implement and more blacklist-oriented than the first one.
