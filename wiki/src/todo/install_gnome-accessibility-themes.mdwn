[[As suggested on the
forum|/forum/High_contrast_theme_for_visually_impaired]], we should
provide GNOME themes with high contrast, large print, etc. Such themes
are included in gnome-accessibility-themes. We could install it and
document how to change theme.

The technical and security requirements that led to the inclusion of the
Windows XP themes in Tails Greeter are probably not valid in this case.
So installing the package should be enough.
