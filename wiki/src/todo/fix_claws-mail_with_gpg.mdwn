Fix [[bugs/desktop_crashes_with_claws-mail_and_gpg-agent]].

One way to do it, while not harming user experience too much, would be
to:

* disable Claws Mail's usage of `gpg-agent`
* enable Claws Mail's own passphrase caching

This can be implemented this way:

	[GPG]
	use_gpg_agent=0
	store_passphrase=1
	store_passphrase_timeout=10
	passphrase_grab=1

Another way to fix the problem is to replace Seahorse's GnuPG agent
with the regular `gpg-agent`.
See the dedicated [[ticket|todo/regular_GnuPG_agent]].

A last method could be to backport Wheezy's Claws Mail and see if
it fixes the problem.

**Next thing to do**: [[!taglink todo/wait]] for a decision regarding
Seahorse vs. regular GnuPG agent.
