Fix [[bugs/desktop_crashes_with_claws-mail_and_gpg-agent]].

One way to do it, while not harming user experience too much, would be
to:

* disable Claws Mail's usage of `gpg-agent`
* enable Claws Mail's own passphrase caching

This can be implemented this way:

	[GPG]
	use_gpg_agent=0
	store_passphrase=1
	store_passphrase_timeout=10
	passphrase_grab=1

Alternatively, we could try to backport Wheezy's Claws Mail and see if
it fixes the problem.
