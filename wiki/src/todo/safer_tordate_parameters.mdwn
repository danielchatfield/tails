As discussed on tails-dev (<4F2FE29F.8040101@lavabit.com>), "if we
want a long, stable Tor session with a time only handled by tordate
(like when htpdate fails), then the only really safe thing to do is to
*always*, no matter what, set the time to fresh-until", which
effectively removes "*good enough* time" check.

1. implement this [[!tag todo/code]]
1. merge into experimental
1. test in extreme conditions
1. <4F2FE29F.8040101@lavabit.com> also has ideas to improve Tor in
   these situations, that should be forwarded upstream.
