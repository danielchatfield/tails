We should add anti-tests, that is, tests that verify that the test
suite would properly detect failure. Our manual erase memory test
procedure is a good example thereof: it checks that we *can* find the
pattern in memory if we skip the memory wipe step on purpose.

* Do we need an anti-test for non-IP packets in
  `firewall_leaks.feature`? Does it even make sense?  After all, so
  far we've only cared about leaks to the Internet. What non-IP
  packets can leak to the Internet?
