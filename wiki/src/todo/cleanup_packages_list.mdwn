Quite a few packages are explicitly listed in
`config/chroot_local-packageslists/tails-common.list` to satisfy
dependencies of custom packages we now ship in our APT repository.
Assuming these custom packages have proper dependency information
embedded, this should not be necessary... and is very likely to
quickly become outdated wrt. the actual current dependencies.

So, we should drop this duplicate information, compare the
list of packages installed in the resulting ISO, and fix our custom
packages if needed.
