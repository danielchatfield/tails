I don't think you need to consider pre-pentium-pro cpus at all, as
pretty much every such system has to little memory to run the live cd
anyway. Pentium-class computers could rarely use more than 128 MB of
RAM, 64 MB being even more common.

So the only relevant non-PAE capable CPUs really are a few older
Pentium M and Celeron M cpus (the newer Pentium M and Celeron M CPUs
with 533 MHz bus do support PAE) and maybe some old VIA C3 CPUs (which
are rarely used and are also very slow). Every other i686 CPU does
support PAE, including all AMD Athlon/Duron/Geode NX and later CPUs,
as well as all other Intel CPUs besides those early Pentium M models.
