This ticket tracks the progress of replacing certain steps of the
[[manual test suite|contribute/release_process/test]] with automated
tests in `features/usb_install.feature`.

# Tests that needs a pass

The following automated tests need a pass from someone else than
anonym after which the manual test can be removed:

[[!tag todo/test_pass]]

## USB Installer/Upgrader:

After each of the following tests:

* After each of the following tests:
  - The installed or upgraded Tails medium shall be successfully booted.
  - The TailsData partition must survive upgrades.

Tests to run:

* Test "Clone & Install":
  - from USB.
  - onto a USB stick that has a MBR partition table, and no
    partition at all (regression test)
  - onto a USB stick that already has an old-fashioned hybrid cat'd
    Tails on it
* Test "Clone & Upgrade" (onto a USB install containing an older
  Tails):
  - from DVD.
  - from USB.

> This often stalls at unmount time. The commit fb3d08a5 in upstream
> liveusb-creator may help. We should [[!taglink todo/test]] this.

## Persistence

* Try read-write mode. Make sure that changes do survive
  reboot.
* Try read-only mode. Make sure that persistent files are writeable,
  but that no changes survive
  reboot.
