Dear Developers,
<Br><br>
I'd like to make a suggestion:
<br><br>
Wouldn't it be a nice addition to the Tails OS any real-effective anti-keylogger application inspired on (that could be an open source alternative to) Windows' OS app Neo Safe Keys: http://www.aplin.com.au/neos-safekeys-v3/how-neos-safekeys-v3-works
<br><br>
Does anyone know if that open source alternative app already exists? Isn't it being under development yet?
<br><br>
Ps.: I guess Florence is not that efficient as NSK.
<br><br>
Long Live Tails OS!
<br><br>
Best Regards,
<br><br>
Gus
