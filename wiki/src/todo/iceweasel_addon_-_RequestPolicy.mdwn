I think it might be a good idea if addons like [RequestPolicy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/) and [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) were installed in Iceweasel as default.

I'd also like to have RequestPolicy included, in "allow everything" mode by default. Even having it installed but disabled in about:addons would be an improvement over having to download it every time I boot up. The privacy (and speed) improvements when it's fully active are significant.
