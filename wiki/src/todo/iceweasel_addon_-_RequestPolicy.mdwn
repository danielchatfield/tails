I think it might be a good idea if addons like [RequestPolicy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/) and [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) were installed in Iceweasel as default.

> Wrt. RequestPolicy, the benefits would need to be carefully balanced

> strict default policy probably means broken websites, a non-strict
> default policy probably is useless). Not even speaking of auditing

> the Tor Browser Bundle, i.e. not ship this addon.
