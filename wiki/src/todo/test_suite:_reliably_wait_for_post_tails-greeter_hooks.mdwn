In the `I log in to a new session` step we should do something which waits
for all Tails Greeter post-hooks to finish so we can rid ourselves of
steps like `Tails Greeter has dealt with the sudo password`.

This may include making changes to Tails Greeter, e.g. having it
create a file when it's done that we can wait for in the end of the
`I log in to a new session` step.

> after tails-greeter is done IIRC) creates such a file that we could
> poll for.
