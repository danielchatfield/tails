Now that Tails 0.17 and the Torbrowser based on FF17 (with
`0026-Isolate-DOM-storage-to-first-party-URI.patch`) are out, we
want to apply this patch too, set `dom.storage.enabled` to true, and
set `extensions.torbutton.disable_domstorage` to false.

Implemented in the `tails/isolation` branch of our iceweasel
repository and in the `feature/torbrowser` branch of our main
repository, Debian packages built, merged into experimental.

[[!tag todo/qa]]

Also set these prefs like the TBB? [[!tag todo/research]]

	pref("dom.battery.enabled", false); // fingerprinting due to differing OS implementations
	pref("dom.network.enabled",false); // fingerprinting due to differing OS implementations
