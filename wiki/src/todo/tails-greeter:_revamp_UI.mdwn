Report #1
---------

User interface is confusing.

The combination of "green/red icons + the check mark + pushed button" is
really hard to grasp.

How about a big push button labeled "Persistence", maybe with an icon?

The current behaviour for "More options?" is also problematicâ€¦ How about
having a "More options" button at the bottom, near the "Login" button?
Ideally, this would require a "Back" button on the "Administration
password" scren, but even without it, I think the result will be easier
to understand/use.
