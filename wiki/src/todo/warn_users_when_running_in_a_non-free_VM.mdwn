When running inside a non-free VM, suggest that the user switches to
VirtualBox or some other free software VM.

Among the "facts" reported by `virt-what(1)`, these ones are free:
`kvm`, `qemu`, `uml`, `virtualbox`, `xen`, `xen-domU`, `xen-hvm`. So,
if one of the lines returned by `virt-what` is not in this set, then
we should assume Tails is running inside a non-free virtualization
environment.

The file where this logics should be implemented is
`/usr/local/bin/tails-virt-notify-user`.
