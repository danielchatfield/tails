[[!meta title="Debian package build infrastructure"]]

It should be possible to work e.g. on our iceweasel and icedove custom
packages without needing a Ã¼ber-powerful system at `$HOME`.

[[!debpts debomatic]] was setup on the `debomatic.lizard` VM.

It was able to build our iceweasel backport for 17.0.5esr.

Next things to do:

* move the [[!taglink todo/documentation]] to [[contribute]]
* make it so the pbuilder chroots are updated on a regular basis
  [[!tag todo/sysadmin]]
