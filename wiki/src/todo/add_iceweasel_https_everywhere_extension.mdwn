EFF's [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)
Firefox/iceweasel extension is a must-have for Tails.

We have been told it would be packaged in Debian soon. See
[[!debbug 591579]]. Let's wait.

In the meantime this extension has been installed by hand in the 0.7
release, time to test.
