Our filewall could use a more whitelist and principle of least
privilege oriented approach. Not only may it block potential leaks and
deanonymization attacks by compromised processes, but it will also
force us to be really conscious about new loopback services and users
that are added, which is good in itself.

The general idea is:

* We reject all loopback connections by default, both IPv4 and IPv6.
* For each user and service (on loopback) combination we want to allow
  we create an iptables rule.
* Prefer IPv4 for local services so we don't have to maintain an
  additional set of rules for IPv6 (e.g. I2P and cupsd currently use
  IPv6).
* Enable logging of dropped packets (helps with identifying
  miscofigured applications).
* Try to eliminate all unnecessary sources of dropped packets.

Some example of user access rights:

* For the `amnesia` user we allow:
  - Tor's `SOCKSPort`: `tcp 127.0.0.1:9050`
  - Tor's `ControlPport`: `tcp 127.0.0.1:9051`
  - System DNS: `tcp/udp 127.0.0.1:53`
  - Polipo: `tcp 127.0.0.1:8118`
  - I2P: `tcp 127.0.0.1:{4444,4445,6668,7657,7659,7660`
  - CUPS: `tcp 127.0.0.1:631`
  - Monkeysphere `tcp 127.0.0.1:6136` (`MSVA_PORT=6316` in environment)
* For the `htp` user we allow:
  - System DNS: `tcp/udp 127.0.0.1:53`
  - Polipo: `tcp 127.0.0.1:8118`
* For the `pdnsd` user (which runs the "System DNS" service allowed
  for the `amnesia` and `htp` users above) we allow:
  - Tor's `DNSPort`: `tcp 127.0.0.1:8853`
  - ttdnsd: `tcp/udp 127.0.0.2:53`

Note: ttdnsd is hardcoded to chuid to nobody but since nobody might be used
for other processes with other requirements (e.g. jake's other project
which we may consider using at some point, tlsdate, which has the same
hardcoded privelege drop) it'd be great if we could send a patch/request
to upstream ttdnsd for adding a "--chuid <username>" option. I don't
think any other process in Tails runs as the nobody user right now, so
there's no hurry.
