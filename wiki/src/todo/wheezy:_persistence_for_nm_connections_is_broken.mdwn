Persistence for NM connections is broken. See [corresponding issue in 
Liberte](https://github.com/mkdesu/liberte/issues/4)

> Is it really, even after most of the secrets handling was moved
> back to GNOME keyring, and the Wi-Fi connections back to be
> considered as "user" ones unless user is allowed to configure
> system ones (since [[!debpkg network-manager-gnome]] 0.9.4.1-3)?
> Perhaps tweaking the policykit settings so that the `amnesia` user
> is not allowed to configure connections would be enough to
> workaround this?
