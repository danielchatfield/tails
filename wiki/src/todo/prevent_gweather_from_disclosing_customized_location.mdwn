When one adds a custom location in the GNOME Clock applet, and "Set"'s
it, a request for weather information is made to weather.noaa.gov,
that presumably discloses the custom location chosen by the user.

Setting the `/apps/gweather/prefs/auto_update` GConf key to false does
not help.

A workaround that was suggested to us is to add `weather.noaa.gov` to
the "Ignore Host" list in the GNOME Network Proxy preferences: without
a proxy configured, these requests cannot go out. At first glance, it
looks a bit hackish, and it would be nicer to disable this feature in
a way that works even if the hostname in use changes some day, but in
last resort, we might end up doing that.

Next thing to do: [[!taglink todo/research]] a (probably GConf -based)
way to disable that feature.

We should [[!taglink todo/test]] using the GConf options
`/schemas/apps/clock_applet/prefs/show_weather` or
`/schemas/apps/clock_applet/prefs/show_temperature`.
