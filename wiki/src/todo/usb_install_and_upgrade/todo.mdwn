Misc.
=====

- write a simple GUI that resets a USB stick that previously contained
  a isohybrid Tails to a sane state
  OR document with nice screenshots how to do so on GNOME / Windows [bertagaz]

Upgrade
=======

Until we support incremental updates (see
[[todo/usb_install_and_upgrade]] for details), our installer must
allow upgrading a (non-running) Tails that is installed on a removable
device. The existing code should already support this, but we need to
double-check this and possibly wrap that feature, UI-wise, in a way
that properly support this usecase. Putting ourselves in the situation
of documenting how to use our installer to perform an upgrade may be a
good way to detect remaining problems.

Input
=====

[bertagaz]

- test installing from ISO file while running a Tails system
- test cloning from USB on bare metal
- test cloning from CD on bare metal

Documentation
=============

- update [[todo/usb_install_and_upgrade]] with current decisions and
  plans [bertagaz]
- update [[download and installation|download]] documentation [bertagaz]

Later
=====

* If stick is <1.5GB case, support installing but don't show the
  persistence checkbox
* Allow setting the system/overlay partitions size via command-line
  option(s).
* Add Tails to the downloadable images list.
* Allow vendors to set
  - default release to download
  - list of downloadable files
* When run from inside Tails, provide an opt-in option to download the
  ISO outside Tor.
* GPG signature verification
  - verify GPG signatures delivered with iso images (see verify_iso_sha1 called in gui.py)
  - Debian provides gpgv-win32 that can be used on Windows
- command-line option --local-hard-disks that would enable
  installation on local hard disks (= not external USB);
  seems to be implemented by --force, see special casing in the
  detect_removable_devices method.

Windows support?
----------------

As [[documented already|doc/installing_onto_a_usb_stick/windows]],
the basic Tails install onto a USB stick from Windows is already easy
to do.

Therefore, even if our installer does not run on Windows / until it
does, those who want to get a "standard" install of Tails on USB can
either burn a CD or use a "basic" install of Tails on USB, and then
run our installer in clone mode from Tails.

Proper Windows support would be welcome, though.

Try http://www.pyinstaller.org/ to create a single binary file for
Windows and for OS X. Include those binaries on Tails images?
