Support for obfsproxy was added with a `ClientTransportPlugin` line in
`torrc`, but this breaks other kinds of proxy one may need to pass Tor
traffic through.

Steps to reproduce the problem: Vidalia Tor settings, Network, I use
a proxy to access the internet, enter proxy info, click ok.

Vidalia errors out, and `/var/log/tor/log` says:

	[warn] Controller gave us config lines that didn't validate: You have configured more than one proxy type. (Socks4Proxy|Socks5Proxy|HTTPSProxy|ClientTransportPlugin)

As a first step, adding `ClientTransportPlugin` only when bridge mode
is enabled would fix all usecases but using a regular bridge *and*
a proxy.

**Next thing to do**: implement this. [[!tag todo/code]]
