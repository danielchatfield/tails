The OTR plugin FR translation in 3.2.0-5 is incomplete and
largely sucks. An updated, complete and proof-read one is in
upstream CVS.

This was fixed in current Wheezy, but the updated translation, while
generally much better than the old one, is buggy in places (raw `%s`
displayed on screen), so this should be looked at again.
