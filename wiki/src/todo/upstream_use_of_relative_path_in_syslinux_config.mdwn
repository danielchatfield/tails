Removing all absolute paths in our SYSLINUX config has the advantage
that to convert the configuration from ISOLINUX to SYSLINUX, the
directory name is the only thing that actually needs to be changed.

Implemented in Tails in
[5e41f57485](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=commit;h=5e41f57485).

Should be done upstream.
