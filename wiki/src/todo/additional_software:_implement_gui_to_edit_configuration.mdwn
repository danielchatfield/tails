Design and implement a nice GUI to select additional software packages to make persistent
persistent (possibly among those that have been installed during
session).

Proposal:

- (preemble) merge the 3 APT persistence options : APT lists cache, APT packages cache,
  additional software packages
- when Alice (logged with administrative privileges with additional software
  persistence setup) installs a package, she gets a notification "Do you want to
  reinstall this software package next time you boot Tails?" with a button to add
  this package to additional software packages
- when Alice removes a packages incuded in additional software packages, the
  package is removed from the list of additional software packages and she
  gets a notification "The software package was removed from your additional
  software.".
