The [[!wikipedia NX_bit]] helps enabling executable space protection.
Most 64bits x86 CPUs support this but Tails ships a -686 32 bit
kernel.

[[!toc levels=2]]

It seems Debian's -686 kernel does dot enable this, but the
-686-bigmem kernel does: `CONFIG_X86_PAE=y` is set in the
`debian/config/i386/none/config.686-bigmem` file, inside Debian's
svn://svn.debian.org/svn/kernel/dists/sid/linux-2.6, since PAE require
HIGHMEM64 to be enabled in the kernel config.

To use a PAE + NX-enabled kernel we need to build an image with
`--linux-flavours 686-bigmem` in `auto/config`.

Beware! according to
[Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/NX_bit#Linux)
"the PAE mode that is required to use the NX bit causes pre-Pentium
Pro (including Pentium MMX) and Celeron M and Pentium M processors
without NX support to fail to boot". This is confirmed by a great
number of sources:

- [report](http://www.kernelcrash.com/blog/openvz-and-asterisk-and-pae/2009/02/03/)
  of a thinkpad t42 not booting with PAE support enabled
- <https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+question/33381>
- <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xen-source/+bug/111434>
- the first generation Pentium M (Banias) and some second generation
  Pentium M (Dothan) has no PAE support [will not boot if PAE is
  required](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-os-dev/browse_thread/thread/f30ae8e73e451048)

=> seems like we cannot default to use the bigmem kernel, and should
at least provide the non-bigmem one as an alternative choice in the
bootloader or wait for non-PAE systems to be rare enough so that we
can stop supporting them.

## Selecting the kernel depending on hardware capabilities

The HDT (hardware detection tool) syslinux module
([homepage](http://www.hdt-project.org/), [page on syslinux
wiki](http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/Hdt_(Hardware_Detection_Tool)))
has code that might help supporting this; it's been shipped in
mainline syslinux for a while. On the other hand does *not* offer any
kind of feature that can be used to parameterized the boot menu.

Debian multi-arch installer's syslinux menu autodetects
amd64-compatible hardware and pre-selects the right default kernel.
Seems like it uses the `default64` menu keyword (see debian-installer
Git repository). This does not allow to select a kernel depending on
PAE support.

Other COM32 modules shipped with syslinux might be better suited for
our specific needs. See especially `ifcpu.c32`; according to its
source code, it can "run one command if system match some CPU
features, another if it doesn't" and is supposed to be used
e.g. like this:

	label ifcpu
	    com32 ifcpu.c32
	    append pae -- boot_entry_1 -- boot_entry_2

	label boot_entry_1
	    kernel vmlinuz_entry1
	    append ...

	label boot_entry_2
	    kernel vmlinuz_entry2
	    append ...

... which apparently would suit our needs.

The `ifcpu64.c32`
[module](http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/Ifcpu64.c32) seems
to provide the best of both worlds, allowing to do different things
for 64-bit hardware, 32-bit hardware with PAE support and 32-bit
hardware without PAE.

We should now [[!taglink todo/test]] this.
