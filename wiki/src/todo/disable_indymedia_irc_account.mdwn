At the beginning of 2013, irc.indymedia.org banned access to their
server from Tor, if not using SASL.

Pigdin 2.7.3 does not support SASL.

Pidgin 2.10.7 supports SASL but it's a pain to backport for Squeeze,
so this can be enabled again in [[todo/Wheezy]].

We propose to remove the preconfigured IRC account until we can ship a
version of pidgin that supports SASL.

[[!taglink todo/done]] in 0.17.1.
