As proposed on the forum, see [[forum/No_MSN_-_no_alternative__63__]], we could
consider including msn-pecan as an alternative pidgin plugin to provide a MSN.

It's in debian since squeeze, seems to support SSL, is under active development,
etc.

See [[https://code.google.com/p/msn-pecan/]].

We need to [[!taglink todo/research]] if it's any more secure than the
"normal" Pidgin's MSN support, which might have been improved since
the last time we checked.
