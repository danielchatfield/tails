Great stuff!.Don't have'always on'cable & have found that the above is required in all Live CDs(Debian,Ubuntu,etc).Would be great if someone could provide an option to include the above info to be inserted into the download permantly.Also,it really does isolate the dard drive.The indicator light stays off & did not recognize the Swap partition on a dual boot(Windoze/Ubuntu) machine as does Damn Small Linux.I am promoting & distributing Tails to all.Thanks,Dave.
