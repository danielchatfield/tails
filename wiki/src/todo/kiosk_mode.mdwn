In situations where Tails is used as the operating system setup on
public "kiosk" computers, many people did experience the need for
a special mode that would better suit the needs of these situations:

* allow booting from hard-disk
* remove the unsafe browser user and launcher: **done**
* remove the persistence setup launchers: **done** (pending for 0.16)
* don't allow users to enable persistence?
* session timeout: see [webconverger implementation](http://webconverger.org/blanking/)
* more?

An initial implementation of the kiosk mode is entered by adding
the `kiosk` option to the kernel command-line.
