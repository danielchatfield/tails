[[!parent screen_locker]]

Add a "Lock Screen" action to the [[shutdown button|todo/better_power_off_button]].

## Only show the "Lock Screen" button when a password is set

Can be done with some `.xbel` thingie, e.g.
<http://superuser.com/questions/62124/how-to-remove-lock-screen-and-logout-from-the-gnome-main-menu-in-sled11>),
and disable gnome-screensaver's automatic post-timeout screen locking
(some trivial GConf setting)
