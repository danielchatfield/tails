Let's wait until we
[[todo/decide_what_kind_of_web_support_do_we_want_to_provide]] first.

If we decide to reuse the content of the old forum in some way we need
to finish cleaning it first. That process is documented below.

Using <span class="application">mc</span>, the GNU Midnight Commander,
you can then browse the forum content by chronological order.

  - Move to the `forum` folder.
  - Run the [[`restore_mtime.sh`|todo/improve_the_forum/restore_mtime.sh]]
    script that updates the modification time of both the original post
    and the folder containing the corresponding comments to the date of
    the original post, retrieved through Git. It takes as argument the
    maximum age, in days, of the threads for which to restore the date.
  - Start mc in the `forum` folder.
  - To mix both directories and file in the file listing, press F9 and
    choose Options -> Panel options... -> Mix all files.
  - To sort files by modify time, press F9 and choose Left -> Sort order
    -> Modify time.
  - To have a preview of files in the right panel, press F9 and choose
    Right -> Quick view.

This happens in the `doc/sort_the_forum` branch.

  - Before pushing changes it's good to check the forum for old
    questions without answers and possibly answers without questions:

        for i in * ; do [ -d $i ] && [ ! -f "$i.mdwn" ] && echo $i ; done

        for i in * ; do [ ! -d ${i%%.mdwn} ] && ls -l $i ; done

  - Merge from master branch to get the new threads.
  - Merge this branch into master to reduce the load on the server.
    Pushing such commits can take a while, even if they are only delete
    content from the forum...
