# 3.11 Fingerprint

Tails tries to make it as difficult as possible to distinguish Tails
users from other Tor users.

Iceweasel is configured to match the fingerprint of the Tor Browser
Bundle and the known differences, if any, are listed in the [[known
issues|support/known_issues]] page.

However the fact that different extensions are installed in Tails and in
the TBB surely allows more sophisticated attacks that usual fingerprint
as returned by tools such as <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> and
<http://ip-check.info/>. For example, the fact that Adblock is removing
ads could be analysed.

From the point of view of the local network administrator, Tails is
almost exclusively generating Tor activity and that is probably quite
different from other TBB users. We believe this would be hard to avoid.
Other possible fingerprint issues on the LAN or ISP exist but we believe
they would be harder to detect. See the discussion on fingerprinting in
the [[Time sync|contribute/design/Time_syncing]] design document and the
[[fingerprint|doc/about/fingerprint]] documentation.

Proposed change:

# Fingerprint
Tails tries to make it as difficult as possible to distinguish Tails
users from other Tor users.

## Web Fingerprint
Iceweasel is configured to match the fingerprint of the Tor Browser
Bundle and the known differences, if any, are listed in the [known
issues](https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/index.en.html) page.

However the fact that different extensions are installed in Tails and in
the TBB surely allows more sophisticated attacks that usual fingerprint
as returned by tools such as <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> and
<http://ip-check.info/>. For example, the fact that Adblock is removing
ads could be analyzed.

## Network Fingerprint
From the point of view of the local network administrator, Tails is
almost exclusively generating Tor activity and that is probably quite
different from other TBB users. We believe this would be hard to avoid.

If the censorship circumvention option (implemented as bridge mode) or
possible future Tails detection protection option is enabled, we want
the network fingerprint detection resistance, at least to the extend,
that it beats DPI boxes at least as good as the censorship circumvention
tool (implemented using pluggable transports) does.



And there https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Time_syncing
/#index5h1 I'd remove:

"Tails developers still need to think thoroughly of these questions: are
such fingerprinting possibilities a serious problem? What kind of
efforts and compromise should be made to prevent these?"
