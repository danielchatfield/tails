On not-that-small screens, some often needed OpenOffice.org writer
tools (such as font color or highlighting) are hidden from the
toolbar, and one has to go find them by clicking on the "more tools"
arrow (`>>`) at the border of the toolbar. Needless to say, users who
are not too tech-savvy don't find it.

Changing icon size from large to automatic in the preferences
fixes it.

terribly hard to do in Tails source:
