The Debian X strike force maintains Xorg backports for Squeeze:
<http://x.debian.net/reference/squeeze-backports.html>.

We probably want to ship them in Tails for better recent hardware
support.

This is mostly implemented in our `feature/backported_xorg` Git
branch.

virtualbox-guest-x11
--------------------

virtualbox-guest-x11 in squeeze-backports is obviously built against
Squeeze's Xorg ABI. We need to rebuilt it in a Squeeze chroot that
prefers using the backported Xorg development packages when needed.

missing backports

`xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse` and `xserver-xorg-video-geode`
=> ask on the debian-backports@ / debian-x@ mailing lists
