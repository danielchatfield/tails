When a new version is out, users receive a notification message.

This message should point in some way to [[doc/first_steps/usb_upgrade]] instructions.

> It *does* "point in some way": the notification message points to
> the security announce, that reads "We **strongly** urge you to
> [[upgrade to Tails 0.17.2|news/version_0.17.2]]" (pointing to the
> release announce), that itself has a "I want to try it / to
> upgrade!" section. That section points to "Getting started", which
> is overkill for long-time users, so there's room for improvement
> here. However, I'm not sure I want us to point users to upgrade
> instructions without giving them a chance to read the release notes
> including known issues, so IMHO the problem does *not* lie in the
> upgrade notification.

> Calling this a potential [[!taglink todo/documentation]]
> issue, then.
