when I get encrypted text and I want to decrypt it I use decrypt option in gedit (Edit-Decrypt/Verify), and software is set to abolish typing of password after some period of time. This period is short for my long password, especially when I use Florence Virtual keyboard. So, many times I didn't have time to type password, and I must do it again and again until I succeed to be enough fast in typing. It is very stupid idea to limit time for typing password, so, if there is way to prolong time or even to abolish time, it would be great. People should have minimum one minut time to type password, if my password is 40 letters long and I use Virtual Keyboard, surely I will need 40 seconds to type it and some people need even more time.
