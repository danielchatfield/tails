Tails-dev Pidgin Protocols Safe?: https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-October/001830.html

Without encryption, the exit node can see the contact list, all messages, file transfers, audio/video.

The server can always see all those things. If you are connected to a number of people you know, it's obvious who you are.

OTR would only encrypt the messages. Everything else is still visible (depending on encryption) (to the server).

Would be nice if all that were documented.

# AIM
## Encryption
default: use encryption if available

enforce: available

## Misc
Always use AIM/ICQ proxy server for file transfers and direct IM (slower, but does not reveal your IP address) - default: unchecked

> adrelanos comment: the AIM/ICQ proxy would only be a single hop proxy, it's a weak protection to hide IP. Only safe it would go through Tor first. Unknown.
