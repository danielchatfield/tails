Since bridges are easily detected and blocked in some areas (in
particular China, but also places where wholesale SSL blocking is
used), we need to support
[obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy-instructions.html.en).

There was a Vidalia [plugin](http://gitorious.org/obfs_gui/) project
which could have made the configuration easier for the end user, and
more easily integrated into our current [[bridge
mode|todo/bridge_support]]; however, we're told it is stillborn.

We're said no replacement is planned. At some point TBB may ship with
obfsproxy but Tor would only launch it when you configure an
obfs2 bridge.

obfsproxy is now part of Debian.
