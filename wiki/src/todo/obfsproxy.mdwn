The [Obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en) 
project exists to achieve the benefits of Tor's 
bridges together with traffic obfuscation.

# Use cases

## Censorship circumvention

Since bridges are easily detected and blocked in some areas (in
particular China, but also places where wholesale SSL blocking is
used), something like obfsproxy is needed in Tails.

## Hiding Tor usage

In situations where both reliability *and* obfuscation are required
despite an adversary having control of the user's local network
*traffic obfuscation* must also be employed. This traffic obfuscation
is **imperative** where the user's welfare or liberty my be
jeopardised by her use of Tor.

# Implementation

The branch `feature/obfsproxy` currently adds rudimentary support for
obfsproxy. It's possible to just add a bridge like `obfs2 $IP:$PORT`
through Vidalia's settings and it works (also works with
[[bridge-mode|todo/bridge_support]] so that even in its current
implementation (which doesn't use `DisableNetwork`), Tails prevents
Tor from talking to the network, and makes Vidalia prompt the user for
bridges, `obfs2` or not).

Merged in Tails 0.15.
