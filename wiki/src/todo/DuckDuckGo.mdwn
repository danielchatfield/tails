I think adding DuckDuckGo to Iceweasel's search engine list (or better yet, as default) would be great for Tails.

DuckDuckGo does not get its results directly from Google like Scroogle does, they use more than one source for their results, but the biggest advantadge over Scroogle IMO it is that they have lots of shortcuts to perform a search and it seems to be actively developed and improved.
