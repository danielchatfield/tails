Here are couple of notes from a discussion we had about the Tails
documentation. The discussion arose when someone proposed to write an
FAQ for Tails and we felt the need to think more globally about the
documentation.

FAQ
===

Someone proposed to write a FAQ for Tails. Here are a couple of comments
on that.

- The FAQ could be a list of common questions but the answers should
  point to more complete answers in the real doc.
- It could be possible to give several answers to the same question.
- Some questions will surely go beyond the scope of Tails so in this
  case we should rather point to other references (eg. Wikipedia) than
  rewrite things that are already existing.
- We need to write a big warning to the FAQ to say that people need to
  face the truth:
  - It is not possible to give a simple answer to a complex question
  - It is not possible to protect from bad uses of Tails
- To sum up: the FAQ should be see as another entry point to the doc,
  another format to explore the same content without simplifying or
  duplicating what's in the real doc.

## actual questions

- BitTorrent
- Flash
- macchanger
- why isn't software X or Y installed?
- what to do if Tor does not connect (e.g. unplug/replug the network cable)

Documentation guidelines
========================

- We should reuse as much as possible the Tor documentation.
- When writing doc on software included in Tails we could try to push it
  upstream, just as we're doing for code.
- When should also try to push upstream the translation of docs that we
  produce.
- For screenshots we try to favor partial screenshots without rescaling. For
  example using a 800×600 screen resolution. JPG should be lighter that PNG.

Possible next steps forward
===========================

- Continue the fix the walkthrough merged in the documentation (in progress in
  `doc-rework` branch (cf. [[todo/adapt_documentation_from_Incognito]])
- Found a problem? → suppressed?
