The following sentence might pretend that the locked screen interacts
badly with the emergency shutdown:

« When the screen is locked, it's not possible to quickly shutdown the
computer properly (i.e. with memory erasure): the computer's shutdown
button is inhibited, and the fact to put out Tails' device does not shut
the computer down. »
