We should install the [Metadata Anonymising
Toolkit](https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/jvoisin/mat.git) in
Tails... as soon as we consider it fit enough for a release, as it's
still a bit too buggy for our taste. Let's wait a
bit more.

APT repository:

	deb http://gaffer.ptitcanardnoir.org/intrigeri/debian/mat/ squeeze-backports main

> [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.9
