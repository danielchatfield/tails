[[!taglink todo/wait]] for [[basic persistence|todo/persistence]] to
be implemented.

Some users may want to separate different Tails profiles depending on
the intended activity ([[examples|forum/Persistence_Discussion]]).

This will increase security and usability by separating files and settings into different encrypted containers.

- It will provide good unlinkability and workspace between different internet activities.
- Getting caught while using Tails or brute-forcing a single container will not reveal the rest of the containers.
