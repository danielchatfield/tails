It's been observed by some people that the NEWNYM button in TorK was 
sometimes not effective enough to get a new identity, e.g. a new
circuit was actually not established, or at least the exit node did
not change.

This is why a "Restart Tor" launcher has been put, as a quick'n'dirty
workaround, to the Gnome panel.

This issue needs to be investigated further. If there is a real bug
behind this, it has to be reported to Robert Hogan (the TorK
maintainer).
