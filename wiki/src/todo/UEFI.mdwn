Some hardware ([[bugs/ThinkPad_X220_vs_GPT]], recent Mac) cannot boot
Tails from USB, due to firmware limitations. Making Tails support UEFI
would fix this problem on such hardware.

* a recent snapshot of Libert√© Linux has added UEFI support

Debian unstable's Linux 3.2.16-1 kernel has "UEFI stub" support, which
allows it to be started directly since the EFI boot menu.

Matthew Garrett detailed [the ISO images for Fedora 17 installation
CD](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/11285.html) and [their Mac
support](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12037.html): it supports BIOS,
UEFI, Mac
platforms when burned to a CD or written directly to a USB stick. This might be
nice for the ISO that Tails distribute, but not applicable to support USB
sticks with incremental updates.

There is then two big area that needs work to support EFI:

 * ISO images need to support EFI, both for DVD and when [[dumped on USB
   sticks|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]]. A work similar to the one done by
   Matthew Garrett on Fedora 17 should probably be done [[!taglink
   todo/upstream]] in [live-build](http://live.debian.net/).
 * The [[USB installer|contribute/design/usb_installation]] needs to
   setup the partition table and system partition in a way that can boot
   on both BIOS and UEFI systems. Proper Mac support would be a nice bonus.
