For [[!taglink release/2.0]], we want at least basic UEFI boot
including Mac.

Some hardware ([[bugs/ThinkPad_X220_vs_GPT]], recent Mac) cannot boot
Tails from USB, due to firmware limitations. Making Tails support UEFI
would fix this problem on such hardware.

Debian unstable's Linux 3.2.16-1 kernel has "UEFI stub" support, which
allows it to be started directly since the EFI boot menu.

Matthew Garrett:

* [Getting started with UEFI development](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/18773.html)
* detailed [the ISO images for Fedora 17 installation
  CD](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/11285.html) and [their Mac
  support](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12037.html): it supports BIOS,
  UEFI, Mac platforms when burned to a CD or written directly to a USB
  stick. This might be nice for the ISO that Tails distribute, but not
  applicable to support USB sticks with incremental updates.

There is then two big area that needs work to support EFI:

 * ISO images need to support EFI, both for DVD and when [[dumped on USB
   sticks|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]]. A work similar to the one done by
   Matthew Garrett on Fedora 17 should probably be done [[!taglink
   todo/upstream]] in [live-build](http://live.debian.net/).
 * The [[USB installer|contribute/design/usb_installation]] needs to
   setup the partition table and system partition in a way that can boot
   on both BIOS and UEFI systems. Proper Mac support would be a nice bonus.
