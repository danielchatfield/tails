I couldn't find place where it is possible to allow JavaScript for
specific sites. I'm using Firefox with JavaScript disabled,

but it would be very useful for me to enable JavaScript for few
trusted sites, which doesn't work fully when JavaScript is disabled.
It is possible to switch JavaScript on and off globally via
preferences, but it is not user friendly way. Maybe something like
NoScript Firefox addon?
