There is a firefox plugin at http://www.yourvideofile.com/ which allows users to download youtube videos for offline viewing. It can be installed on a TAILS LiveCD system and appears to work (the downloaded videos can be watched in Movie Player. **No evaluation of the security of the plugin has been attempted**. If the plugin is found to be secure it might make a useful addition for TAILS users who are too paranoid to install a flash player.
