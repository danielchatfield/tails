In Tails 0.12.1, I manage to connect to a FTP server on the
Internet (such as `ftp.de.debian.org`) neither with iceweasel nor with
GNOME "Connect to server" feature.

At least the latter works properly to connect to a FTP server on the
LAN by IP.

We might not be able to fix that: [[!tor_bug 1259]] and [[!tor_bug 3290]].

[[!tag todo/upstream]]
[[!tag broken_window]]
