We need to start testing Tails built against Wheezy.

Work is done our the `wheezy` Git branch.

Current state: builds, but mostly unusable.

Remaining problems:

* `amnesia` users sudoers credentials to localize console at profile
  time don't work
* `tails-greeter` is not installed
* `/usr/local/sbin/udev-watchdog` not found
* I2P packages are not removed (uninstallable on Wheezy)
* scim-pinyin and scim-uim must be replaced by the Wheezy equivalent
* Persistence for NM connections is broken. See [corresponding issue in
  Libert√©](https://github.com/mkdesu/liberte/issues/4)
