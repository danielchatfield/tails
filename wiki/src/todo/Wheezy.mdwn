We need to start porting Tails to Wheezy, and test it.

Work is done in the `feature/wheezy` Git branch.

**Current state** (2013-06-30): builds, boots. Quite some things are
broken, and many minor features had to be disabled to workaround
build issues.

Windows Camouflage
------------------

How to implement the Windows Camouflage mode in GNOME3 "Classic" (aka.
fallback) mode?

* Ubuntu's GNOME Classic is not that far from a good old GNOME2 DE:
  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseGnomeClassicTweaks
* The default theme (`/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/`) can be
  forked and customized.
* GTK3 Windows-like themes seem to be
  [in the works](http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2012/03/27/moar-windows-themes/),
  and <http://gnome-look.org/> has a few ones.
* some [customization tips](http://askubuntu.com/questions/69576/how-to-customize-the-gnome-classic-panel)

What works
==========

* Reading (IMAP) and sending email with Claws.
* OpenPGP applet symmetric enc/dec
* Roundcube webmail
* MAT cleans a PDF
* Erase memory on shutdown
* USB installer (Clone & Install)
* Iceweasel/torbrowser works
* FTP works on LAN in Nautilus
* Streaming in Totem
* Unlocking and using already created persistence
* Tails-additional-software works
* Unsafe browser
* Orca
