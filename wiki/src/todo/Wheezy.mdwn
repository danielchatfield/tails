We need to start porting Tails to Wheezy, and test it.

Work is done in the `feature/wheezy` Git branch.

**Current state**: builds; booting this ISO gives no usable
tails-greeter, though.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Problems to fix
===============

[[!tag todo/code]]

* Fix tails-greeter:
  - support for setting the keyboard layout was removed from GDM
  - Once the call to `GdmGreeterService.SelectLayout` in
    `community-greeter.py` is replaced by `pass`, the greeter GNOME
    session starts, but no window is displayed in there.
  - Rewrite as a lightdm greeter (like unity-greeter)?
* Fix `/etc/init.d/tails-kexec`: `/etc/default/locale` does not exist.
* `amnesia` users sudoers credentials to localize console at profile
  time don't work
* `/usr/local/sbin/udev-watchdog` not found
* `scim-anthy`, `scim-pinyin`, `scim-uim` and `scim-hangul` must be replaced by the Wheezy equivalent
* Get `config/chroot_local-hooks/50-virtualbox` back (revert 592d364)
  and fix it.
* Persistence for NM connections is broken. See [corresponding issue in
  Libert√©](https://github.com/mkdesu/liberte/issues/4)
  - Is it really, even after most of the secrets handling was moved
    back to GNOME keyring, and the Wi-Fi connections back to be
    considered as "user" ones unless user is allowed to configure
    system ones (since [[!debpkg network-manager-gnome]] 0.9.4.1-3)?
    Perhaps tweaking the policykit settings so that the `amnesia` user
    is not allowed to configure connections would be enough to
    workaround this?
* Use GNOME fallback mode (but ship GNOME shell too if it's not too
  big -- that will be unsupported, but advanced users might want to
  find their own ways to use it)
* Find and install I2P packages compatible with Wheezy, then revert
  1b9ae07 and 16d9aef.
* Fix the build for real (workaround'd in 4218f2e4): at `lb source`
  time, when `lb chroot_sources install` wants to run `apt-get
  upgrade`, it fails the build with `The value 'wheezy' is invalid for
  APT::Default-Release as such a release is not available in the
  sources` (due to the APT proxy not being configured at this time,
  the last `apt-get update` failed and the package indices are empty).
  If one simply removes `APT::Default-Release`, then the pinning is
  broken when indices are not available. Actually, if `lb source` just
  exited early unless `LB_SOURCE` is enabled, we would not have
  this problem.
* Re-enable Indymedia IRC account (disabled by
  `bugfix/disable-indymedia-irc-account`) and convert it to use the
  hidden service and SASL.

Tests to do
===========

[[!tag todo/test]]

* is [[bugs/plymouth_stops_too_early]] fixed on Wheezy?
* is [[bugs/desktop_crashes_with_claws-mail_and_gpg-agent]]
  fixed on Wheezy?
* does `liveusb-creator` work fine with both shipped kernels on
  Wheezy? does it work fine *without* our patched `dbus-python`
  package too?
* replace laptop-mode-tools with acpi-support + pm-utils + hdparm
  (that ships `/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/95hdparm-apm`);
  does this combination take care of Wi-Fi power management?

Research to do
==============

Windows Camouflage
------------------

How to implement the Windows Camouflage mode in GNOME3 "Classic" (aka.
fallback) mode?

* Ubuntu's GNOME Classic is not that far from a good old GNOME2 DE:
  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PreciseGnomeClassicTweaks
* The default theme (`/usr/share/themes/Adwaita/gtk-3.0/`) can be
  forked and customized.
* GTK3 Windows-like themes seem to be
  [in the works](http://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2012/03/27/moar-windows-themes/),
  and <http://gnome-look.org/> has a few ones.
* some [customization tips](http://askubuntu.com/questions/69576/how-to-customize-the-gnome-classic-panel)
