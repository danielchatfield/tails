At boot time (and probably at hotplug time too):

 * unblock Wi-Fi, WWAN and WiMAX
 * ignore Bluetooth (dealt with another way:
   [[todo/protect_against_external_bus_memory_forensics]])
 * soft-block all other kind of wireless devices (UWB, GPS, FM)

(See commit 4ad1490d in Libert√© Linux Git.)

Roughly implemented in `feature/set-wireless-devices-state`.

# Next things to do

1. Test at least with Wi-Fi. [[!tag todo/qa]]
1. Write design documentation. [[!tag todo/documentation]]
1. Write a short documentation page about how to manually unblock
   a blocked device (e.g. GPS). [[!tag todo/documentation]]
