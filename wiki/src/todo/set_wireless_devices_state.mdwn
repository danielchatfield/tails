At boot time (and probably at hotplug time too):

 * unblock Wi-Fi, WWAN and WiMAX
 * unblock Bluetooth so that it can be [[dealt with another
   way|todo/protect_against_external_bus_memory_forensics]]:
   if Bluetooth is disabled by default by the firmware,
   then the chosen way of handling it could not be implemented
   unless we unblock Bluetooth ourselves.
 * soft-block all other kind of wireless devices (UWB, GPS, FM)

(See commit 4ad1490d in LibertÃ© Linux Git.)

Roughly implemented in `feature/set-wireless-devices-state`,
handling of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi works fine.

> Branch has been tested succesfully at commit c7e0ca9.

# Next things to do

* Write a short documentation page about how to manually unblock
  a blocked device (e.g. GPS). [[!tag todo/documentation]]
* Review the implementation. [[!tag todo/qa]]
* [[!taglink todo/test]] on various hardware (merged in `experimental`).
