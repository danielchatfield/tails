At boot time (and probably at hotplug time too):

 * unblock Wi-Fi, WWAN and WiMAX
 * ignore Bluetooth (dealt with another way:

 * soft-block all other kind of wireless devices (UWB, GPS, FM)

(See commit 4ad1490d in Libert√© Linux Git.)

Write a short documentation page about how to manually unblock
a blocked device (e.g. GPS).
