Killing I2P ungracefully is bad for the I2P network, and this is most
likely a prevalent behaviour among Tails users. For I2P to shutdown
gracefully, it needs up to 11 minutes to let all its current
participatory tunnels to expire. Killing I2P before that makes peers
using these participatory tunnels experience timeouts and disconnects,
which most definitely is bad for the network. Since Tails users are
likely to shutdown Tails quickly without waiting these 11 minutes,
this is a good reason to enable hidden mode = disable participating
traffic.

See comment 248 on [[forum/Why do we share traffic for I2P ?]] for
implementation hints.

Implemented in `bugfix/i2p_hidden_mode`,
[[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.17.
