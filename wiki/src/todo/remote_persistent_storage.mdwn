Implementation
==============

When the persistence feature is enabled **and** no persistence media is found locally, the user would be asked for a server address + login, password + encryption passphrase. 

Possible remote storage include:

 - IMAP
 - sftp
 - [Syncany](http://www.syncany.org/) (similar to Dropbox, but data is encrypted locally) supports many storage types, including IMAP
 - [s3ql](http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/) Full featured, FUSE-based, filesystem that is synced remotely. Features excellent performance with intermittent connectivity, deduplication, compression, encryption, and full linux filesystem support (hard links, attrs, etc). Written in python. For remote storage, uses S3 or OpenStack.

 - Is there a Fuse IMAP filesystem? Other ways to fetch a given email?
 - duplicity
> duplicity, an encrypted backup solution has an IMAP backend since
> version 5.0.7 (6.x is available in lenny-backports and squeeze). It is
> able to backup and restore from a folder available in an email
> account. One downside: it uses Python's imaplib which does know
> how to connect to IMAP server with SSL or StartTLS, but not how
> to verify X.509 certificates.
 - Encryption: symmetric GnuPG, encfs, ecryptfs, file-backed LUKS or   dm-crypt?
