Many ISPs now have a large number of "free" WiFi access points based
on the modem/router boxes they install at their customers home.
Examples: FreeWifi, NeufWifi, Fon, probably others worldwide.

A lot of these run a captive web portal (often using a
catch-all-DNS-requests system) where potential user can authenticate.

Such hotspots are pretty useful but currently unusable in Tails due
to DNS torification and Tor enforcement.

We should implement a way to fix this.

For each kind of hotspot:

* list of possible ESSID
* optional: allocated IP address classes
* optional: network test script?
* optional: SSL certificate fingerprint?
* a WWW::Mechanize::Shell script

Main script in in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d.

Test current connection against known hotspots.

When connected to a known hotspot, starts WWW::Mechanize::Shell
script. Values are entered through a callback than will uses
Gtk2::Notify and some custom widgets. Known login/passwords should be
put in gnome-keyring with a browser like completion system (enter
first letters, pick login, password is prefilled). Maybe we could use
the same login/password database as Epiphany.

For hotspots that requires a periodic refresh, we can run another
WWW::Mechanize::Shell script in a loop. NetworkManager is meanwhile
monitored through DBUS to kill the loop if connection is lost. If loop
fails try once more through default script before displaying a
notification.
