While trying to keep the ISO image as small as possible we spotted some
unwanted file we could get rid of :

  - /usr/share/inkscape/examples
  - /usr/share/inkscape/tutorials
  - changelog.gz and changelog.Debian.gz in /usr/share/doc

For the moment there's a script doing that in
config/chroot_local-hooks/98-remove_unwanted_files.

We want to add the selective deletion of scribus translation files
rather do the whole deletion using dpkg's --path-include and
--path-exclude options, as described in :

http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/11/15/save-disk-space-by-excluding-useless-files-with-dpkg/

Dealing with the scribus files would imply generating a
/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes file from the AMNESIA_SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES
during the build process.

Maybe this should be done through the 'amnesia' config script itself?

Done
----

In the end we're removing those files through
config/chroot_local-hooks/98-remove_unwanted_files since we didn't manage to
remove them through dpkg since that would imply modifying those options between
the bootstrap and the installation of the packages and we think there is no easy
way of doing that with live-build.
