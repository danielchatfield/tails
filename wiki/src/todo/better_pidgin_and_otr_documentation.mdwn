The [[documentation about Pidgin and OTR|doc/anonymous_internet/pidgin/]] should be improved.

Pidgin
======

  - Mention the Tails channel and link it from [[support/talk]].

  - Document the random nick preset, see
    [[/todo/Pidgin___40__documentation__41__]].

  - Incorporate the findings on [[todo/Pidgin_Protocol_Review]].

OTR
===

- Link to the [homepage of OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) and
  quote their introduction paragraph.

- There is a decent documentation for OTR in [Security in-a-box: How to
  Use OTR to Initiate a Secure Messaging Session in
  Pidgin](https://securityinabox.org/en/pidgin_securechat).

- How do we get external documentation translated? [[!tag todo/discuss]]

- Get the OTR upstream to link this documentation from their homepage.

> How about the documentation pages linked from the OTR GUI itself?
> IIRC they are pretty good too, and at least some are translated.
> --intrigeri
