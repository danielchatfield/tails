Rationale: running a proprietary OS in a virtual machine *inside*
Tails would be useful by folks who cannot afford doing without their
preferred Windows-only piece of software but still want to work in a
relatively secure environment.

# Next steps

1. Install VirtualBox packages from our APT repository instead of from
   `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia/packages/`.
   [[!tag todo/code]]
1. Rewrite history of `feature/virtualbox-host` to not include the
   host binary packages.
1. Test the result.
1. Try just deleting the VirtualBox networking drivers files
   (`vboxnetadp` and `vboxnetflt`) to disable network support
   altogether, see if it breaks anything else, (proposed in January
   2013 in the "Tails 0.14 rc1 virtualization testing & howto install
   virtualbox and vmplayer" thread)

## Later / maybe

1. [[!taglink todo/research]] how to disable VirtualBox network modes
   that bypass the Tails firewall: see discussion on tails-dev
   (2012Q4, "Tails 0.14 rc1 virtualization testing & howto install
   virtualbox and vmplayer" and "VirtualBox host software vs.
   networking" threads).

  (Using an adaptation of this we could instruct users to set up each
  guest with Bridged Adapter on `vnet0` and then it should magically
  rout all traffic from the VM through Tor. Identity correlation 
  could be dealt with by using a dedicated TransPort with the
  IsolateDestAddr option set.)

* Whonix (back in times where it still was called TorBOX) implemented
  something very similar: https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/OneVM/

  - Tor was running on the host = Tails in this case.
  - Some operating system was running inside the Virtual Machine.
  - iptables / bridging was used to route all VM traffic through Tor.
  - It was probable affected by identity correlation through circuit sharing.
