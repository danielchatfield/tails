If we run `@vm.execute("groups", "amnesia")` it'll only list
membership in the major group, i.e. `amnesia`.

Ideally, as long as we don't use the remote shell to test actions that
a real user could perform, and only use it to check results and
prepare stuff, this should not be a practical problem.

However, we have at least one exception (apt-get update / install)
that uses the remote shell to emulate user action, and it would be
a pain to rewrite using Sikuli, so we'd rather keep this exception.

This was documented in the "how to write tests" documentation,
but could still be worth fixing.
