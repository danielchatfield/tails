 * If the passphrase is wrong, the field should probably be reset.
   Otherwise, if I enter a wrong passphrase multiple times, I have no
   feedback that something happened when I pressed enter (field stays
   full of dot and error message does not move, 'login' button stays
   unpressed while trying to open the volume).
