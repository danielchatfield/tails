Tails now hides the TailsData partition, so that persistence partition that is
used doesn't appear twice (see [[todo/persistence:_hide_or_fix_TailsData_volume]]

However, this actually hides *any* partition that is labeled TailsData. What
if I am using Tails to look the content of the persistent partition of
another Tails USB stick (e.g. to fix issues or make backups)?

A proper fix that is coming to my mind is to add a similar udev rule
when the persistence is activated, matching the (known) UUID of the
partition and not its label.
