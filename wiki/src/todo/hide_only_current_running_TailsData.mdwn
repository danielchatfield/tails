Tails now hides the TailsData partition, so that persistence partition that is
used doesn't appear twice (see [[todo/persistence:_hide_or_fix_TailsData_volume]]

However, this actually hides *any* partition that is labeled TailsData. What
if I am using Tails to look the content of the persistent partition of
another Tails USB stick (e.g. to fix issues or make backups)?

Potential fixes:

1. add a similar udev rule when the persistence is activated, matching
   the (known) UUID of the partition and not its label.

2. add a static udev rule that only hides such a partition if it's
   found on the boot device by using the same approach as in
   `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-boot-dev-ownership.rules` (introduced in
   branch `bugfix/writable_boot_media`). A difference compared to the
   other fix suggested would be that this fix always hides the boot
   device's TailsData partition, even if it's not activated, which we
   may or may not want.
