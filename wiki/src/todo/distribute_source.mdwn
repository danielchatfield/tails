We need to distribute the source of what we ship inside Tails binary
images, which basically means:

- the source for included Debian packages
- the source for Debian packages that are used at build-time to
  compile binary files, but not shipped inside the chroot (e.g. some
  `-dkms` packages, probably)

# Implementation

## live-build --source

live-build's `--source` option allows to build a source image
corresponding to the binary image that is being built. The default
source image format is tar.

It would not be too much work to upload such a source image along with
a newly released Tails ISO. On the other hand:

- our sometimes scarse upload bandwidth would feel even more painful
  that it currently does;
- on the long run, doing this without any de-duplication would waste
  big amounts of storage space, especially considering a big set of
  packages is shared between quite a few Tails releases, during a
  given Debian stable release life-cycle.

## reprepro

We want to setup our own [[APT repository]], and it's likely reprepro
will be involved somewhere in the loop. reprepro knows how to
partially mirror APT repositories, so we could use it to inject, at
release time, the needed list of source packages.

## direct offer of source upon request

See [Finnix and GPL
compliance](http://blog.finnix.org/2011/08/21/finnix-and-gpl-compliance/).

## grml source-report

See their
[Gitweb](http://git.grml.org/?p=grml-infrastructure.git;a=tree;f=source-report).
Seems clever, as usual.
