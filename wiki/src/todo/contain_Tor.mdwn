Tor probably has one the biggest attack surface exposed by Tails to
a network attacker. It also knows the IP that's being used to connect
to the Internet. Therefore, anything is welcome to make it harder, for
an attacker, to escalate from "Tor exploited" to "whole system under's
attacker control" / "anonymity compromise".

When a container-based solution (e.g. LXC or `unshare(1)`) becomes
a viable, *secure* solution for creating isolated jails, the chroot
approach used by the unsafe browser will be easily adaptable to
contain Tor.

Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for user namespaces to be part of Linux
(3.8, likely) and a userspace interface to be ready.
