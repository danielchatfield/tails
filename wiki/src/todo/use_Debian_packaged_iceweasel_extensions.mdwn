It is really easier to maintain Debian-packaged iceweasel extensions,
rather than maintaining them ourselves in the Git-ified `/etc`.

CS Lite
=======

No other cookie manager is packaged yet, so we should package this one
or similar. [[!tag todo/research todo/code]]

Needs:

- blacklist by default
- ability to whitelist domains at build time
- 2-clicks to whitelist a domain / website at runtime

Adblock Plus
============

Now available in Squeeze => [[!taglink todo/wait]] for the time we
build against Squeeze.
