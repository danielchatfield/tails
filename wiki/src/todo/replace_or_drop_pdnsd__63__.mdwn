The [[!debpts pdnsd]] Debian package was orphaned, and is not in very
good shape. It is currently only used for caching purposes in Tails.

We hear people we trust, who have been using the Tor DNS resolver
directly for months as their system resolver, and are happy with its
caching feature.

So perhaps we could simply *remove* pdnsd from the loop.

This was implemented in `feature/remove-pdnsd`, merged into
devel. [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.15.
