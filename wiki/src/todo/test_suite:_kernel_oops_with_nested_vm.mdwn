I (anonym) get a Kernel oops on my real host when running
`erase_memory.feature` in nested VM setup (not otherwise). The top
excerpt of the kernel oops (which leaves the real host completely
unresponsive) is:

    BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffff87ffffffffff
    IP: [<ffffffffa06ea57a>] __direct_map.isra.92+0xe3/0x1a1 [kvm]
    PDF 0
    Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP
    Modules: [snip]
    CPU 2
    Pid: 5229, comm: kvm Not tainted 3.8-trunk-amd64 #1 Debian 3.8.3-1~experimental.1 [snip]
	[snip]

It has happened every time I tried this feature, either when filling
the memory or when wiping it. I've tested all combinations of the
current Wheezy kernel (3.2.39-2) and current experimental kernel
(3.8.3-1) on both the real host and the testing VM, but to no avail.

I don't get this with a non-nested VM setup (i.e. when the automated
test suite is run from bare metal).

Also, I don't get it *as often* in the nested VM setup if I decrease
the TailsToaster RAM from 8 GiB to 5 GiB in both scenarios.

So it seems we may have an upstream linux kernel bug. Can someone else
please [[!taglink todo/test]] this?
