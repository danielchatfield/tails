# Rationale

While adding optional functionality to Tails, we need a way to ask the
user for them at startup. This is for example required for
[[localization_at_runtime]], [[persistence]], [[macchanger]] and
[[bridge support]], [[include_truecrypt]]. The backlinks at the
bottom of this page probably constitute an exhaustive list of this
task's reverse dependencies.

# Ongoing and future work

Some of this task is being implemented by Max during GSoC2011.
Progress can be tracked via [[TailsGreeter]] page.

Once tails-greeter is shipped in Tails, the current syslinux
localization menu should be removed. It could e.g. be replaced by a
(hidden by default) troubleshooting menu, such as the one being
designed (used already?) for Fedora ([blog
post](https://mairin.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/fedora-installation-user-experience-improvements-syslinux/),
[syslinux.cfg](https://fedoraproject.org/w/uploads/2/28/Installux-syslinux-prop1-proto1-syslinux-cfg.txt),
[screenshot with menu
hidden](https://fedoraproject.org/w/uploads/8/8a/Installux-syslinux-prop1-interrupt-nointerrupt_animated.gif),
[screenshot with timeout interrupted and menu
displayed](https://fedoraproject.org/w/uploads/5/5e/Installux-syslinux-prop1-interrupt_animated.gif)).
Work on this should be done in our `feature/tails-greeter` Git branch.

# Past research

## Using boot menus

In 0.6, the localisation at runtime is done in the syslinux menu for PCs, see
[[localization_at_runtime]], but it's very hard to add more than one set of
options to that kind of menu.

The only boot menu that will stay supported upstream seems to be gfxboot (to be
verified). It configuration seems however quite hard to write.

## Using a menu in the initramfs

It's probably easier to write a nice user interface once linux is running.
However, it should be done in the initramfs as the parameters wil be used at
this stage.

### curses

It seems to be the easier way to implement it.

### graphical UI on top of the framebuffer

This seemes to be well supported by Qt:
<http://qt.nokia.com/products/platform/qt-for-embedded-linux>.

### launching X11 very early

An other option would be to start X11 very early and to run a menu under X11.
Then plymouth-x11 could be used to display a splash screen. The issue is that
it seems quite hard to start GDM in an already running X11 instance.

## Providing a configuration menu just before start desktop session

### Current syslinux menu

This one could in this case be only a minimalistic menu like the default debian
live one, providing the ability for the user to choose between 

Still the user might have to choose at this stage some options we might be unable
to run in the later xsession menu, like for thr truecrypt or persistent option.
In this case, we could either tell the user to hit tab and type the needed
option, or add an item to the syslinux menu.

### Via GDM 3

On a "classic" Debian installation, users can choose their language and
keyboard at the same time they enter their login and password in GDM.

Tails currently uses *autologin*, so these options do no usually
shows up. Hence the selection of language and keyboard very early in the
*boot* process.

But it looks like every configuration options that Tails would need do
not really require to be applied before the desktop session actually
starts.

So instead of hacking a "boot" menu, we could benefit from the flexible
architecture of GDM 3:

- Replace `gdm-simple-greeter` (the default user/login password prompt)
  by a new GTK+ application hereby named `tails-greeter`. To do so, it
  should be mostly about hacking `autostart` files.
- `tails-greeter` would display widgets and help on changing the MAC
  address, persistence, and other configuration options.
- When the *Start Tails* button is clicked, `tails-greeter` would send
  the needed D-Bus message to trigger an automatic login.
- The selected configuration will be applied within one or more scripts
  in `/etc/gdm3/PostLogin`.

This variant is slated for implementation during GSoC2011 project. Progress can be tracked via [[TailsGreeter]] page.

With this approach, the initial boot menu (*syslinux*) can be kept
pretty minimal and mostly offer *failsafe* boot options (e.g. overcoming
issues preventing the graphical environment to start).

### Getting rid of GDM 3

Another approach might be to get rid of GDM 3, and launch a (possibly GTK+)
application with the /etc/X11/Xsessions.d/ mechanism. This might be easier to
maintain that a having to hack GDM 3, and maybe might free some more space in
the squashfs.
