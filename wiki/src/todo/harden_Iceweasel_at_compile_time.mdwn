Rationale
=========

Given our current [[contribute/release schedule]], there's one week in
six when Tails users are vulnerable to a bunch of known security
issues in Iceweasel.

Roadmap
=======

1. Find out what additional hardening compilation option can possibly
   be added to Iceweasel by the Debian maintainer. The Debian security team
   might be happy to help.
   - [[!tag todo/research]] Gather the maintainer's already stated
     opinions on the topic: [[!debbug 609975]] and [[!debbug 653191]]
   - Design a great plan. Hardening compilation options currently
     enabled in:
     - TBB: none
     - Debian's Iceweasel 17.0.3 ESR:
       * enabled: stack protected, Fortify Source functions
       * disabled: PIE, Read-only relocations, Immediate binding
     - Ubuntu's Firefox: PIE, stack protected, Fortify Source functions,
       Read-only relocations, Immediate binding
   - Implement a great plan.
   - See what the maintainer is happy to take.
1. If still needed, add more hardening compilation options to our own
   Iceweasel builds.

=============

* Once we have [[AppArmor support in
  Tails|todo/Mandatory_Access_Control]], we'll probably want to use it
  as an additional way to contain the least powerful exploits
  a bit more.
* [[todo/Incremental upgrades]] may help putting out a minor Tails
  release a bit faster after a Firefox ESR release.
