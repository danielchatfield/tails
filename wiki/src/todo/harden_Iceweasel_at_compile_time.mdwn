Rationale
=========

Given our current [[contribute/release schedule]], there's one week in
six when Tails users are vulnerable to a bunch of known security
issues in Iceweasel.

Roadmap
=======

1. [[!taglink todo/research]] what exact hardening compilation options
   are currently enabled in:
   - Debian's Iceweasel ESR
   - Ubuntu's Firefox
   - TBB
1. Find out what additional hardening compilation option can possibly
   be added to Iceweasel by the Debian maintainer. The Debian security team
   might be happy to help.
   - [[!taglink todo/research]] the maintainer's already stated
     opinions on the topic (XXX: link to the existing bug report in
     the Debian BTS)
   - Design a great plan.
   - Implement a great plan.
   - See what the maintainer is happy to take.
1. If still needed, add more hardening compilation options to our own
   Iceweasel builds.

=============

* Once we have [[AppArmor support in
  Tails|todo/Mandatory_Access_Control]], we'll probably want to use it
  as an additional way to contain the least powerful exploits
  a bit more.
* [[todo/Incremental upgrades]] may help putting out a minor Tails
  release a bit faster after a Firefox ESR release.
