A set of boot splash screen / Desktop theme / iceweasel theme that
mimic Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer would be nice when using
a public computer in order to raise less suspicion.

The Tails boot splash screen should be black with a tiny dots-based
progress bar. Later on in the boot process, tails-greeter would
provide a way to optionally start the GNOME session with a Windows
look-alike theme; the Windows look would be the auto-selected default
in case a Windows OS is detected on fixed disks. Users could make this
setting persistent when using persistence. tails-greeter should look
like Windows login screen (best would be to look like Windows XP, but
looking like Windows NT4 login screen would be an acceptable, much
easier, first implementation step).

# Convenience/Tails features vs. stealth/windows look

How closely do we want to emulate the Windows look? Is it worth
sacrificing certain features of the standard Gnome desktop of Tails in
order to look more like Windows? Examples of potential (or even
likely) differences (ignoring theming issues):

* Application launchers
  - we probably should settle on only the most "translatable"
    application launchers with respect to how common some
    corresponding application is in Windows, e.g. Iceweasel is a
    keeper and it should have the Internet Explorer icon, but Seahorse
    should go as it has no counterpart in Windows.
* Desktop icons
  - Windows certainly doesn't have "Report bug" and "Tails
    documentation" icons. OTOH these should normally be hidden behind
    some fullscreen window (e.g. Iceweasel).
* Popups (e.g. from NetworkManager and Tails security check)
  - these will only be shown for a short time so they may be ok.
* Systray icons
  - Like with launchers we should make these have icons from Windows
    when possible.

When it comes to themeing issues most of them may be solvable, but
there's diminishing returns in how much you get for the time
invested. In general the Windows camouflage feature can probably only
be best effort. We'll never be able to perfectly emulate the Windows
look completely. This is further complicated by that public computers
may have custom theming/desktop wallpapers/launchers/desktop
icons/tray icons. And if we want Iceweasel to look more like IE, which
version of IE? And let's not even start talking about different
version of Windows.

Hence, our goal shouldn't be that our theme should pass a close
inspection, but rather that it shouldn't raise any alarms for someone
glancing on the screen for a second or two in passing from a
distance. We should focus on getting the things that are visible most
of the time right, e.g. window styles, colour theme, cursor and panel.

# Windows XP theme

[XpGnome](http://ubuntu.online02.com/node/14) was the most suitable
theme found. XpGnome is basically just a package gluing together three
packages from Gnome-Look.org:

* [XPLuna](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/XPLuna?content=83797)
  for Windows XP looking themes for gtk and metacity.
* [GnomeXP](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/GnomeXP?content=69587)
  for Windows XP icons.
  - In order to save space there's room for symlinking some of the
    many duplicate icons.
* [Cursor XP](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Cursor+XP?content=77833)
  for a Windows cursor.

Except installing these, XpGnome's installation script also uses gconf
to fix some further issues (desktop icons, panel etc.).

## Implementation

0. In the feature/winxp_theme branch we install homebrewn packages of the
   XpGnome components listed above, and have a script that does the gconf
   part. This feature can be activated by putting "winxp" on the kernel
   command-line.

0. In feature/tails-plymouth-theme branch we use a custom plymouth theme that
   looks close to windows vista bootup. So I consier "The Tails boot splash screen
   should be black with a tiny dots-based progress bar" as pending. It is
   however working only on machines with KMS-enabled graphics drivers. On other
   machines it falls back to the old text plugin. [[!taglink todo/qa]].

## What remains todo

### Non-blockers

0. "the Windows look would be the auto-selected default in case a
   Windows OS is detected on fixed disks": can be implemented right
   now (probably using os-prober, /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober may be
   worth a look). This should only be done when we've agreed that the
   theme is in a good enough state for end-users.
0. Fixing the remaining theme bugs would also be nice:
   * Buggy icons in the left Tree panel in Nautilus ("locked" icon, until
     some event forces Nautilus to refresh the icon).
   * Almost invisible text: try moving your mouse over the "Icon View"
     toolbar button in Nautilus, or mark an icon on desktop and change
     focus to some window.
   * The desktop icons lack localization.  
0. Theme bugs that we really want to be fixed, but that cannot be fixed:
   * The notification area and clock applet have the same background
     as the rest of the panel, but in windows they are a much lighter
     shade of blue. Fixing this seems impossible as applets cannot have
     custom backgrounds (?).

# Windows Vista theme

[[!taglink todo/research]] for a suitable theme.

## Candidate Windows Vista themes

None.

# Windows 7 Theme theme

[[!taglink todo/research]] for a suitable theme.

## Candidate Windows 7 themes

* [Win2-7](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Win2-7+Pack?content=113264)
  from [GNOME-Look.org](http://gnome-look.org). Waiting for a response
  from the person who posted to see if backporting to Debian 6 is
  possible and/or the limitations/issues that may be encountered.

# Other miscellaneous ideas

It was also proposed [[on the forum|forum/splash_screen]] to:

- Autodetect the wallpaper of the original OS and use it by default.
- Use a splash screen at boot that looks like a paused video player.
