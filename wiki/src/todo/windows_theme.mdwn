A set of boot splash screen / Desktop theme / iceweasel theme that
mimic Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer would be nice when using
a public computer in order to raise less suspicion.

# Themes

## XpGnome

[homepage](http://ubuntu.online02.com/node/14)

- tested, works quite well on 0.6.2
- 1.2MB compressed once the duplicated files are removed from the
  tarball
- bugs:
 * desktop wallpaper is set to mozaic mode
 * mouse-on-dropbox => invisible text
 * probably more
