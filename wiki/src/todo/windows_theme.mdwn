[[!tag todo/easy]]

A set of boot splash screen / Desktop theme / iceweasel theme that
mimic Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer would be nice when using
a public computer in order to raise less suspicion.

The Tails boot splash screen should be black with a tiny dots-based
progress bar. Later on in the boot process, tails-greeter would
provide a way to optionally start the GNOME session with a Windows
look-alike theme; the Windows look would be the auto-selected default
in case a Windows OS is detected on fixed disks. Users could make this
setting persistent when using persistence. tails-greeter should look
like Windows login screen (best would be to look like Windows XP, but
looking like Windows NT4 login screen would be an acceptable, much
easier, first implementation step).

# Next things to do

Look at what Windows XP, Vista and Seven look like and [[!taglink
todo/research]] suitable themes.
