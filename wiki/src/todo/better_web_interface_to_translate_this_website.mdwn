Pootle, Transifex, [Weblate](http://weblate.org/) and friends provide pretty good interfaces to
translate PO files. This website's PO files could be translatable in
Tor project's Transifex system.

Let's now [[!taglink todo/research]] the technical details and ask the
Tor folks to setup what is needed.

See [[!debbug 627693]].

> It was decided to drop this web interface, and instead encourage
> future translation teams to use a proper PO editor and the
> tails-l10n mailing-list.
