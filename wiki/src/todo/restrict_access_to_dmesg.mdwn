Setting the `kernel.dmesg_restrict=1` sysctl would make it slightly
harder for an attacker to get information about the machine.

Note that the default live user is allowed to indirectly run dmesg as
root anyway
(`config/chroot_local-includes/etc/sudoers.d/zzz_tails-debugging-info`),
and we probably want to keep this for WhisperBack, so this would not
protect against a desktop application compromise. Still pretty cheap
and not entirely useless, though.
