We've been [[asked|todo/Reactivate_the_power_off_menu]] numerous times
to make the emergency shutdown button a bit less dangerous, especially
since it's close to the "Close this window" button.

Many solutions were proposed, here's the one we will implement:

Let's leave this button at the same top-right place; clicking it
should open a dropdown menu with three entries:

- Lock screen (once tails-greeter is part of the game)
- Shutdown *immediately*
- Reboot *immediately*

This way:

- it looks like the GNOME3 top-right menu
- it's still pretty fast to use in emergency situations
- reboot comes back
- much less dangerous
