Apt wants to create `/var/cache/archive/pkgcache.bin` near the root of
an aufs mount (but outside it). Unfortunaly, the kernel doesn'l like that.

    # touch /var/cache/apt/packages.bin
    aufs au_lkup_neg:326:touch[<PID>]: I/O Error, apt should be negative on b0

Some code exists in `feature/fix_apt-get_with_RO_persistence`, to be [[!taglink todo/test]]ed.
