If any of the core services (Tor, polipo, DNS cacher/forwarder)
crashes, a clueless user will have to reboot after realising that
"Internet won't come back". That can be quite frustrating.

Supervising these services using daemontools, runit or whatever
process monitoring system would be nice.

Low-priority, but still.

Given we'll [[move to an init system|todo/event-based_init]] that
knows how to baby-sit services (e.g. `systemd`) once Tails is based
on Wheezy, we can use it and find / adapt / write systemd unit files
for the services we want to supervise.

So, let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Tails to use systemd.
