If any of the core services (Tor, polipo, DNS cacher/forwarder)
crashes, a clueless user will have to reboot after realising that
"Internet won't come back". That can be quite frustrating.

Supervising these services using daemontools, runit or whatever
process monitoring system would be nice.

Low-priority, but still.
