Fixing the remaining theme bugs would also be nice:

   * Buggy icons in the left Tree panel in Nautilus ("locked" icon, until
     some event forces Nautilus to refresh the icon).
   * Almost invisible text: try moving your mouse over the "Icon View"
     toolbar button in Nautilus, or mark an icon on desktop and change
     focus to some window.
   * The desktop icons lack localization.  

Theme bugs that we really want to be fixed, but that cannot be fixed:
   * The notification area and clock applet have the same background
     as the rest of the panel, but in windows they are a much lighter
     shade of blue. Fixing this seems impossible as applets cannot have
     custom backgrounds (?).
