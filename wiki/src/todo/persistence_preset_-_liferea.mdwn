It would be nice to provide a persistence preset for Liferea (that
makes little sense to be used without persistence, actually).

However, that piece of software uses versioned configuration
directories (e.g. `~/.liferea_1.8/`) so if we do it right now, we will
have to handle the Squeeze -> Wheezy transition.

A cheaper plan could be:

1. [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Tails on Wheezy to be close enough
1. Implement this feature in time to ship it with the first Tails
   based on Wheezy.
1. Kindly ask upstream if they would not mind using a single,
   unversioned config directory name.
