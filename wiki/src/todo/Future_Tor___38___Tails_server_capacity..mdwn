I'm beginning to wonder if more people use the above that your servers may not be able to handle the traffic,which would be similar to a DDoS attack.Iceweasel goes to check.torproject.org by default & if other OS users use the above as their homepage & just continue opening new tabs or enter a new URL in the address bar then your servers will be taxed.You people are doing a great job but you don't have Google's budget to purchase high end servers.
