This is what's said about
[RefControl](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/953) in the
[Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#recommendedextensions):

> [...] this extension allows more fine-grained referrer spoofing than
  Torbutton currently provides. It should break less sites than
  Torbutton's referrer spoofing option.

As the http referer (sic!) can be used to track users to some extent,
we should try to do something about it. And, indeed, RefControl
manages this with its 3rd party spoofing without breaking many sites
(examples of broken sites?).

Configuration
=============

Torbutton should be configured to not use its referrer
spoof. RefControl should be configured to use "Forge (3rd Party)" per
default. This will make RefControl spoof the http referer only when
following links across domains (i.e. to a 3rd party domain) but leave
it unchanged when following links within the same domain. When
spoofed, the referer is set to the base domain of the link
(i.e. a.com/b becomes a.com).
