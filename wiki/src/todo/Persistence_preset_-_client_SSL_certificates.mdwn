Access to certain web applications can require client-side certificates as an additional form of authentication. Without having them in the persisted storage they need to be re-imported every time before use.

For Iceweasel aspects of them are stored in ~/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE/cert8.db and (I believe) key3.db

The discussion in persisting bookmarks [[todo/persistence_preset_-_bookmarks]] contains the logic required to implement such a feature.
