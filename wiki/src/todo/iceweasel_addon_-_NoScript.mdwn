This is what's said about [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) in the
[Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#recommendedextensions):

> Torbutton currently mitigates all known anonymity issues with
> Javascript. However, if you are concerned about Javascript exploits
> against your browser or against websites you are logged in to, you
> may want to use NoScript. It provides the ability to allow
> Javascript only for particular websites and also provides mechanisms
> to force HTTPS urls for sites with insecure cookies.

> It can be difficult to configure such that the most sites will work
> properly though. In particular, you want to make sure you do not
> remove the Javascript whitelist for addons.mozilla.org, as
> extensions are downloaded via http and verified by javascript from
> the https page.

OTOH, according to Karsten (thread "Quick question on Torbutton and
NoScript" on or-talk), it is a bad solution to use both plugins,
"which will do the same".

This might be useful for more advanced users that want additional
privacy. Given how widely used this addon is by said user group it
seems likely that any incompatibilities with other addons we use
should('ve) be(en) identified and fixed quickly.

Configuration
=============

Since this plugin will confuse the uninitiated, and since Torbuttin
already blocks all known JavaScript issues, NoScript should be
configured to allow all sites per default. It's either up to the user
to blacklist domains, or disable all sites per default and then
whitelist the ones deemed trustworthy.

Tor Browser Bundle configuration
--------------------------------

The [Tor Browser Bundle](http://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/),
starting with its 1.0.0 version, ships the NoScript and BetterPrivacy
extensions. As [explained in details by Mike
Perry](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2010/msg00214.html),
they tweaked NoScript's configuration a lot; e.g. JavaScript is
enabled by default, but they make use of other NoScript
privacy features. See their [NoScript
configuration](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/config/noscriptconfig.json).
