Once a language is selected, while the user customizes other settings,
the locales should be generated. Login should be blocked (probably
with visual indication that something is going on) until locales
generation is finished.

It's not that simple to implement: t-g is executed as 'Debian-gdm' -
it can't run localedef to generate locale; we have to weight the risk
of sudo / suid vs. the user experience benefits.

[[!taglink todo/done]]: Fixed in a different way by using `locales-all`.
