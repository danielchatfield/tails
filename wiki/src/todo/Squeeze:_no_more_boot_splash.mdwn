Splashy was removed from testing and won't be part of the Squeeze
release. The reasons for this removal (see [[!debbug 599245]]) are not
of the kind we can afford ignoring (incompatible with KMS, progress
bar broken with new parallel dependency-based init system, dead
upstream).

We then need to choose amongst the following solutions:

- switch to another boot splash system (plymouth? seems a bit too
  buggy to be shipped on a LiveCD)
- forget the boot splash thing until a maintainable solution arises
  (could be affordable as GDM now starts quite earlier)

We could [[!taglink todo/test]] plymouth with various hardware, some
that uses KMS by default on Squeeze and some that does not.
