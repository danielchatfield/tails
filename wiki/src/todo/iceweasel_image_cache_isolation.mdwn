Now that Tails 0.17 and the Torbrowser based on FF17 (with
`0024-Isolate-the-Image-Cache-per-url-bar-domain.patch`) are out,
we want to apply this patch too.

Implemented in the `tails/isolation` branch of our iceweasel
repository, Debian packages built, merged into experimental.

[[!taglink pending]] for 0.18.
