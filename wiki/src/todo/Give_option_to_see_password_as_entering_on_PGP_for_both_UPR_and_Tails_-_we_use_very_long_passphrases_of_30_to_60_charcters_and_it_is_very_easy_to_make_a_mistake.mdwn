creating Give option to see password as entering on PGP for both UPR and Tails - we use very long passphrases of 30 to 60 characters and it is very easy to make a mistake.

also please make it possible to copy a passphrase from a document and paste it into the password location to decrypt a PGP documents.

As you know it is very important to day to use very long passphrases.

If possible also give us the option to use SHA 512 hash or Whirlpool hash for the passphrase when we are creating a new PGP key pair.

Everyone I work with uses UPR and Tails, and some of us travel to dangerous countries. 

Please help keep us safe.

Thanks
