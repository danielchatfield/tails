`BeforeFeature('@old_iso')` is supposed to nicely tell you when you've
not specified an old ISO, and it's needed, *but* the `puts` in
`features/support/config.rb` makes the whole test suite hang much less
nicely, if an old ISO is not passed, regardless of whether
it's needed.

Perhaps move the `puts` to the BeforeFeature hook?
