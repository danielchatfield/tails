Given the increasing practice of blocking Tor usage in more
authoritarian countries, censorship resistance is getting more
important. To merely try use Tor might even be dangerous in these
countries as the government can log it an take action against the
user. Hence we should provide an easy to use facility for our users to

* make sure that they always can reach the Tor network, and
* prevent others from knowing that they are using Tor.

In Tor there is the concept of
[bridges](http://www.torproject.org/bridges) which is used to hide the
fact that you are communicating with the Tor network by relaying your
Tor traffic through a so called bridge node which is not listed in
Tor's directory. This is exactly what we want.

Bridges in Tails
==================

While Vidalia makes it straight-forward to use bridges there are some
special considerations that needs to be accounted for in the context
of Tails. Since all Tor is started at boot, it is immediately
disclosed that Tor is used. We need to make it possible for our users
to prevent this, for instance by toggling some option in the boot
menu. However, since all internet traffic is routed through Tor, if a
user don't know of any bridges we have a catch-22 situation since the
user's best possibility to get a bridge is by getting it over the
Internet, for instance from [the Tor project's
website](https://bridges.torproject.org/), IRC or IM buddies and
similar.


Specification
=============

The use of bridges should be optional, and if desired it must be
chosen before Tor starts. The best place for such an option is
probably in the boot menu. When activated the following things should
happen:

* Tor doesn't try to connect directly to the Tor network.
* The user is somehow helped to setup a bridge, and possibly
  instructed how to get one.
* Once a bridge has been chosen, Tor should immediately start to use
  it.

Current work
============

We are going to use Vidalia's bridges configuration UI.

When bridges are enabled (by adding `bridge` to the kernel
command-line):

* [[!tails_gitweb
  config/chroot_local-includes/lib/live/config/204-bridge]] adds a
  buggy bridge (127.0.0.1:7777) to `/etc/tor/torrc` and enables
  `UseBridges` so that Tor does not even try to connect directly to
  the network, even when restarted.
* Vidalia is started with the `-bridgeconf` option brought by our
  custom patch (XXX):
  - network settings are displayed on startup
  - `UseBridges` is enabled
  - a Tails-specifig pop-up is shown.
* As a workaround to [[!tor_bug 2355]], [[!tails_gitweb
  config/chroot_local-includes/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/60-tor-sighup.sh]]
  cleans up the Tor data directory when a network interface goes up.
  A real fix for this bug is being worked on, see the bug page for
  details and status updates.
* When a network interface goes up, Tor and Vidalia are restarted. Tor
  cannot reach its network until the real (working) bridges
  configuration is applied by Vidalia, either saved from previous
  input or newly entered by the user.

Left to do
==========

Here are some things to analyse, and discuss and code.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* Finish pushing a fix for [[!tor_bug 2355]].
* Make our Vidalia patch more generic and upstream it (being
  discussed on [[!tor_bug 2355]]).
* Write end-user documentation.
* Migrate this page's content to the [[contribute/design]] section of
  the website.
* Let the user easily opt-in for connecting to Tor through bridges in
  the [[todo/boot menu]].

Find bridges button
-------------------

Vidalia has a "Find bridges now" button which won't work for us
since it can't reach bridges.torproject.org. To get it to work we
would need some kind of exception in the firewall rules.

The following command is an easy way to download a list of bridges
(requires an exception in the firewall table -- perhaps we can just
run the command as the debian-tor user which has direct internet
access?):

    wget -q -O - https://bridges.torproject.org/ | grep -e "^bridge .*"

It should be noted that just connecting to bridges.torproject.org
can be dangerous if the regime is hostile towards Tor, and/or it
could simply be censored. This must be explained to the user, and
manual input of bridges must be available as an alternative.

[[!tag todo/research]]

Until a solution is found for this issue, we should probably hide this
button.
