Some scenarios uses the live Tor network, which is not entirely
reliable, so we may get failing scenarios when in fact we just
happened to pick a Tor circuit that's too slow, or even one that's
broken but Tor fails to remedy the situation.

For this reason we should tag such scenarios with `@uses_tor`, and
create an `Around('@uses_tor')` hook which re-tries those scenarios
some number of times before actually failing it. That hook should
retry only when it catches some custom exception (e.g. `TorFailed`)
that we make steps throw whenever something that uses Tor times out,
but it should not retry for other exceptions.
