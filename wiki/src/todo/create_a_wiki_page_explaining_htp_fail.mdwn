The wiki page should explains:
  - What are the implications of this failure: maybe no network, or-talk
    has been asked for possible security implications.
  - First things to try to fix and retry all that: check your network
    connection.
  - How to study the problem more in details if needed: how to see the
    logs and understand them.
