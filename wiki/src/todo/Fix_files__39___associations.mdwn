Several file types are associated with the wrong application. Here is a bunch of files' associations that should be fixed.

Feel free to complete.

> No, please. Feel free to file *separate* tickets, one for every issue.

- when runnig nautilus as root, text files are opened with gobby
  instead of gedit.

> Unreproducible when running Nautilus using `gksudo`.

- when opening a PDF file in Iceweasel, gimp is the preselected choice
  instead of Evince.

> I can't reproduce this one in Tails 0.12.1.

- when opening a MP3 file in Iceweasel, audacity is the preselected
  choice instead of totem.  

> Confirmed in Tails 0.12.1. Slightly annoying, but no big deal IMHO
> as Audacity's UI, although a bit complex, displays a big green arrow
> to play the sound file.

- when opening a EXE file, with the *wine* package installed, the
  unarchiver comes first.

> This is not supported. [[Patches welcome!|contribute/how/code]]

- *.sla files should be opened with Scribus

Created a specific ticket for each reproductible issue, thus closing this one.
