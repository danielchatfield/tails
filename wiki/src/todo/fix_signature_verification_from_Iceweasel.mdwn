In Tails 0.19's Iceweasel (at least), after clicking on a Tails
detached signature link such as
<http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/testing/tails-i386-0.19-rc1/tails-i386-0.19-rc1.iso.pgp>,
I am told it is a *PGP/MIME-encrypted message header*, and proposed to
open it with *Decrypt File*.

The same happens with a update-description file hosted at tails.b.o:
<https://tails.boum.org/update/v1/Tails/0.16/i386/stable/updates.yml.pgp>.

To fix that the next things to do are:

  - All signature files have to be renamed with a .sig extension.
  - The webserver providing the file has to associated the
    application/pgp-signature MIME type to it. That's the default in
    Debian Wheezy, but was not the case in Debian Squeeze.
  - To make sure that the webserver returns the right MIME type, link to
    a signature file on tails.boum.org from the download page so we
    don't rely on the configuration of the mirrors.
