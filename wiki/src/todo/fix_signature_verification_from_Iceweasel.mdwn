In Tails 0.19's Iceweasel (at least), after clicking on a Tails
detached signature link such as
<http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/testing/tails-i386-0.19-rc1/tails-i386-0.19-rc1.iso.pgp>,
I am told it is a *PGP/MIME-encrypted message header*, and proposed to
open it with *Decrypt File*.

The same happens with a update-description file hosted at tails.b.o:
<https://tails.boum.org/update/v1/Tails/0.16/i386/stable/updates.yml.pgp>.

As a consequence, the signature files for the ISO image have been
renamed with a .sig extension, and are now being served on
tails.boum.org by default.

Does the IUK mechanism have to be modified to use .sig instead of .pgp
extension as well?
