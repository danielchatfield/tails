In Tails 0.19's Iceweasel (at least), after clicking on a Tails
detached signature link such as
<http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/testing/tails-i386-0.19-rc1/tails-i386-0.19-rc1.iso.pgp>,
I am told it is a *PGP/MIME-encrypted message header*, and proposed to
open it with *Decrypt File*.

The same happens with a update-description file hosted at tails.b.o:
<https://tails.boum.org/update/v1/Tails/0.16/i386/stable/updates.yml.pgp>.

This may be a GNOME MIME association issue or a web
server misconfiguration.

Next thing to do is to check the MIME type the web server(s) pretend
these files are. [[!tag todo/test]]
