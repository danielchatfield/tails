First of all there's the question of how the VPN should be setup
w.r.t. Tor, i.e. before or after. We can probably only support one of
these easily.

# VPNs are accesses through Tor

This situation is a bit tricky since all our applications are
explicitly configured to use our local proxies to reach Tor. Hence
we'll get in the situation where our traffic flows like this:

    Application => Tor => VPN => Proxy on localhost

where the last step is very problematic -- we want it removed. Trying
to make something that Just Works for our users is a very difficult
problem and a guaranteed headache. Essentially what that requires is
something like a network manager hook that disables proxying in *all*
application configurations, on a case-by-case basis. 

This would not be an issue for web resources if we ship
[[an insecure browser|todo/add_support_for_free_wifi_hotspots/#index3h2]],
or any LAN resource if we allow unproxied LAN connections (e.g. a
generalization of: [[todo/iceweasel_should_support_LAN_webservers]]).

## Use cases

* Access services that blocks Tor.
* Reach a local resource on a VPN that is not accessible in any other
  way.
* Reach a VPN non-anonymously (e.g. your account is tied to you IRL)
  while only hiding your geo-location, which may be the only thing
  you need in some situations. (Maybe invalid since this is not part
  of the PELD spec (yet?) AFAIK.)

# Tor is accessed through a VPN

Unlike the other VPN setup yhis would be trivial to implement.

## Use cases
 
* Access Tor on networks where it's blocked. Using a bridge is
  preferable when possible, and should always be possible once
  [[todo/obsfproxy]] is mature and in wide use. Until then this
  may be an acceptible workaround.
* Some ISPs require their customers to connect to them through VPNs,
  especially PPTP. Tails is currently unusable for them out of the
  box.

# What we don't want

Some users have requested support for VPNs in Tails to "improve" Tor's
anonymity. You know, more hops must be better, right?. That's just
incorrect -- if anything VPNs make the situation worse since they
basically introduce either a permanent entry guard (if the VPN is set
up before Tor) or a permanent exit node (if the VPN is accessed
through Tor).
