(As long as they are pointed to by IP rather than by hostname),
Iceweasel should allow connecting to webservers in the LAN.

This is a usecase we really want to support and we want to find a solution that
would not make that optional.

We couldn't think about an attack which would be made possible by allowing this:
- if an attacker in control of both local and online resources tries to
  deanonymized a local user accessing online resources, this user could be
  anonymized anyways by other means;
- if an attacker tries to force the access to local resources from online
  resources, the Tor client will discard them anyways.

# A bit of context

A workaround was available before Torbutton 1.4, that is before Tails
0.8, in the name of toggling "off" the status of Torbutton. This does
not work anymore, due to a change in the meaning of
`torbutton.locked_mode`. This change is actually welcome: with an
interface that said "Tor disabled", users were sometimes thinking Tor
was disabled, which was not really the case in Tails.

# Implementation

FoxyProxy gives us the means of a short-term solution for the "normal"
Iceweasel profile; granting direct (no-proxy) access to RFC-1918 IPs
should be pretty easy to implement using FoxyProxy:
`config/chroot_local-includes/etc/iceweasel/profile/foxyproxy.xml`.

Rationale: accessing resources on the LAN is a usecase that can
benefit from the protections offered by Torbutton aside of proxy
settings. These resources and/or the link to them may not be
fully trusted.

If only doing this still allows an adversary to de-anonymize users (while they
could not do in another way) it might also be necessary to modify Torbutton to
treat RFC-1918 IPs as 'local' and not 'online', just as it does for local URLs
such as 'file:///'. We have emailed tor-talk
(<4EB54F29.1010307@pimienta.org>)
to share our plan and ask about how risky that would be. No answer so far.
