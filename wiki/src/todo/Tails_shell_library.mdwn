Some of our custom shell scripts duplicate code that should be
refactored out to a shell scipt library that these can included
instead, both for improved code clarity and the usual reasons for
avoiding code duplication. Examples:

* tor_is_working()
  - /usr/local/sbin/unsafe-browser
  - /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-time.sh
* extracting long and short language codes from $LANG
  - /usr/local/sbin/unsafe-browser
  - /usr/local/bin/tails-documentation
  - also see [[todo/fix_locales_form_wrong_assumption]]
* Various wait_until_some_conditionis_met constructs used here and
  there.
* Greping boot parameters in /proc/cmdline.
* Uniform way to start GUI applications from system scripts:
  - /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/60-iceweasel.sh
  - /usr/local/sbin/restart-vidalia
* Some of our custom stand-alone scripts can probably be move in
  there:
  - /usr/local/sbin/restart-vidalia
  - /usr/local/sbin/restart-tor
