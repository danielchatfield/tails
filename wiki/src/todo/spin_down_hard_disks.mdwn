[Liberté Linux](http://dee.su/liberte) sets the hard disks standby
timeout to 5min on boot in order to save power. They also set acoustic
management to quiet.

Implementation notes
====================

See the `etc/conf.d/hdparm` file in Liberté Linux source tree.

List internal hard disks
------------------------

Contrary to the Gentoo ones, the Debian hdparm scripts provide no
facility to set the same options to all PATA and/or SATA drives.

The relevant code could be stolen from the [Gentoo init
script](http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/sys-apps/hdparm/files/hdparm-init-8?view=markup).
**Beware**: it seems their code does not check whether a given disk is
internal or removable, and we probably don't want to spin down
removable disks, especially the one we booted from.

Another possibility to list internal hard disks is to use higher level
tools, such as udev, HAL (more or less deprecated in Squeeze) or
udisks (not in Lenny yet).
