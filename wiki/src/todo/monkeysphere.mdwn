The [Monkeysphere](http://web.monkeysphere.info/) project now seems to
propose a working infrastructure (validation agent, Iceweasel plugin)
for validating HTTPS certificates using the GnuPG web-of-trust.

We now install `monkeysphere`, `msva-perl` and `xul-ext-monkeysphere`
into the system. Monkeysphere is setup to use a hkps:// keyserver.

Use cases
=========

The key problem is... the key: monkeysphere trusts a server's key if
and only if it is signed by a fully trusted key. I think there are two
usecases out there:

GnuPG users
-----------

The people who use (asymmetric) GnuPG in Tails already deal with
their keyring and its [[todo/persistence]]. They would have to sign
the keys for the servers they want to authenticate, persist their
keyring somehow, and be done with it.

GnuPG non-users
---------------

Quite harder. These ones won't bother signing keys and so on. They
still might be interested in Monkeysphere but they will need to rely
on an external authority to sign server keys. As Tails users they
already (hopefully) trust Tails developers not to add spyware to
this system. They might as well trust them to carefully verify and
sign server keys. A possibility is then to mark our own key as fully
trusted in the default amnesia user pubring.

Note: due to Tails developers incapacity to carefully check that
many keys with reliable trust-paths, Tails out-of-the-box
Monkeysphere support for https will be quite poor. This can be seen as
a problem; on the other hand it demonstrates how weak the servers
authentication process really is unless you take care of it yourself
and reclaim your trust-paths!

Implementation
==============

Iceweasel profile
-----------------

We should now provide a second iceweasel profile with all root CAs
disabled.

One way to do it would be to `dpkg-divert libnssckbi.so` by default,
extract all the CAs from the original `libnssckbi.so` and stuff them
into the "normal X.509 usage" profile's DB.

See also the `mozilla/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/README` file in
the `nss` package source tree to learn how to build a `libnssckbi.so`
with a custom list of builtin CAs.

What does not work is to disable this module for the no-CAs profile
using:

    modutil -dbdir PROFILE_DIR -disable "NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module"

MSVA
----

msva-perl is not able to start in Tails environment, even providing
it the IP and port to listen on on the command line:

    msva-perl --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5555
