The [Monkeysphere](http://web.monkeysphere.info/) project now seems to
propose a working infrastructure (validation agent, Iceweasel plugin)
for validating HTTPS certificates using the GnuPG web-of-trust.

We now install `monkeysphere` and `msva-perl` into the system.

Next step: let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for `xul-ext-monkeysphere` to
be uploaded to Debian, which should happen soon.
