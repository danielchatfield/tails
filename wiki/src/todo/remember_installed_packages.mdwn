When user have enabled persistence, it could be nice to remember which
extra packages they have installed.

Either in the greeter or upon login, an
interface could appear offering the user to select which packages should be
reinstalled (all unselected by default).

Having this choice in the greeter could allow users to install their preferred
software without having an administrative password set.

The security implications of this whole idea needs to be researched before
diving in the code.

Also, we must think through if we want to re-install these packages
from cache only, or prefer fetching more up-to-date versions from
online mirrors if available.

Possible implementation tricks
==============================

A configuration snippet can be add in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d` with a
`Dpkg::Post-Invoke` option. This allows to trigger a script each time
APT is run.

This script should query APT database and record all packages that are
not in `autoinstall` state.

On boot time, that list should be filtered with packages that are already
shipped with Tails.
