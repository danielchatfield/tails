For me (anonym) `liveusb-creator` constantly hangs at "Unmounting
/dev/sda" (at 0%, that is before the actual ISO content copy is done)
when using the nested setup (not otherwise). If I take over
the session with `virt-viewer`, close `liveusb-creator` and restart
it, then it usually works. Also, doing something completely retarted
like this also works much more often:

    ...
    And I create a new 4 GiB USB drive named "A"
    And I plug USB drive "A"
    And I wait 10 seconds
    And I unplug USB drive "A"
    And I wait 10 seconds
    And I plug USB drive "A"
    And I wait 10 seconds
    And I "Clone & Install" Tails to USB drive "A"
    ...

What can be the cause of this?

FTR, this still happens on 0.18~rc1.
