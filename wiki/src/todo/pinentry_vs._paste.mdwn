pinentry-gtk does not support pasting into the passphrase text entry.

From a user experience perspective, this is a regression from Tails
0.16 and older, where the Seahorse's agent dialog did allow pasting.
This was e.g. [[reported on our forum|forum/Tails PGP Applet cannot paste password from Keepassx to pgpapplet password entry box?!?]].

However, this is [considered as a feature by
upstream](http://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1374), on the grounds
that the whole point of software such as pinentry is to ensure that
secrets are not stored in insecure places like the X clipboard.

A valid workaround is to use the KeePassX Auto-Type function, we've
[[documented it|doc/encryption_and_privacy/manage_passwords]], so
case closed.
