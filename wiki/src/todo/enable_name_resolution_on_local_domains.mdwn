It would be nice if Tails would be able to resolve local domains (.lan, .local) without forwarding the request to Tor, as obviously, exit nodes will not be able to do so.

Use case: one would like to access her local NAS without having to enter the IP manually.

This probably could be done by extending the use of the "exclude" option in `/etc/pdns.conf`. But, the only upstream DNS resolver currently known by `pdnsd` is Tor. So first, the local DNS resolver needs to be extracted from DHCP (or manual) configuration automatically.
