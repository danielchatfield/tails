At some point, we want to provide a
[[todo/robust_and_strict_New_Identity_feature]].

Until this is done, we want to remove Vidalia's *New identity* menu
entry because its actual pros and cons are unclear and confusing for
end users who often believe it provides them a fresh new Tails
environment, which is very wrong.

We need to add a Vidalia boolean setting to hide that menu entry. No
UI would be needed to set/unset this option.

This could be combined with other options we would like to use for Tails in
Vidalia, for example not showing the 'Start Tor'/'Stop Tor' options either.

Ask nicely Vidalia developer (chiiph) to do it?

Note that *New Identity* is renamed to *New Circuit* in Vidalia 0.3.x
([Rename "New Identity" to "New
Circuit"](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5277)),
which is unlikely to significantly change the aforementioned problems,
so the planned solutions still seems valid.
