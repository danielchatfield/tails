As [pointed out by
rransom](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5741#comment:8),
configuring Tor as the GNOME default SOCKS proxy gives random
applications access to the network. Maybe we should remove this
setting, and instead explicitly torify, in another way, the
applications we really want to access the network and that are
currently relying on the GNOME settings?
