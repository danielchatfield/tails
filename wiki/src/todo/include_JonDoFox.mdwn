From my point of view this project would make a big step forward when the Browser JonDoFox could be integrated in the OS of the live CD. It´s a part of the Anon Project "JonDo" http://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/index.html that tries to bring a max of anonymity to the users by sending the network traffic through multiple networkproxys (like tor does)

JonDoFox http://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/software.html is a special Firefox version (on Linux a special profile) that increases the security very much.
It includes the component NoScript [ Protection against Webbugs, Java and Javascript, Flash, Silverlight and similar threats ],
AdBlockplus [ Filters any part of advertisement on the web, works very effectively on any web page when enough filter lists are installed ] > I have installed every list (about 45) and I never see a single add while surfing!
CSlite [controlles cookie permissions]
Safecache [ The browser gets resistant against cache threats ]

All this tool are great, but when using them in JonDoFox they would need a special preset (default) configuration that is loaded every time during the boot process because it´s annoying to configure NoScript and the and all the other Firefox addons for max anonymity every time you start the live CD.

The browser includes a special Firefox configuration which protects the privacy of the user. It is possible to choose how the referrer and the user agent is send to any web server. A special HTML proxy between the browser and the Tor client would become unnecessary.

I am using it any day, it´s open source and I think your project could make a huge amount of progress when combing Tor with JonDoFox!

I hope you like my idea, if you do so please contact me under the following secure communication interface :

I hope we will get in contact next time

Yours sincerely
