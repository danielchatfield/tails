Next steps
==========

0. remove greasemonkey and the youtube script: **done**
0. [[!taglink todo/wait]] a bit for [[todo/minitube]] to mature; if
   it's acceptable and merged, then perhaps we will consider the
   *easier YouTube* task as completed.
0. We're told that adding `*.youtube.com https://www.youtube.com/*` to
   "no script -> options -> advanced -> external filters -> do not
   filter objects coming from these sites" works. Let's try this and
   see how things go. [[!tag todo/test]]
0. also, [[!taglink todo/test]] the [YouTube HTML5
   Switch](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/)
   iceweasel add-on.
   * needs to be patched to accept running with FF17
   * correctly adds `&html5=1` to YouTube urls
   * this appended URL parameter seems to have no effect (with Tails
     0.17.2's browser)
0. make audio and video codecs autoplay (so that the Tails web browser
   works in a less surprising way, especially for new users; also, the
   idea is that when one goes to a page with audio or video objects,
   they want to read them more often than not)

Alternatives
============

* [[todo/Flash_support]]
* [YouTube Video Download for
  Greasemonkey](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/62634)

Background
==========

* [[forum thread|forum/Youtube_is_now_automatically_HTML5_enabled]],
* [[!tor_bug 3347]]

I visited https://www.youtube.com/ and visited one of the featured videos which is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK_eKGK4JrM . At first it gave me the usual msg flash player, then I added &html5=1 on the URL and refreshed the page. It worked as it should be no issues. After that, most of the videos played out of the box without the &html5=1 that where on the right side as featured/similar. From on of them I got the msg "The browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available." Later I entered https://www.youtube.com/html5 where I verified that my browser does not support h.264, also I had the msg "You are not currently in the HTML5 trial." Hope that helps.
