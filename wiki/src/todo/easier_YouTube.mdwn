Next steps
==========

0. remove greasemonkey and the youtube script: **done**
0. integrate the test reports below and the next steps they suggest as
   part of this roadmap
0. [[!taglink todo/wait]] a bit for [[todo/minitube]] to mature; if
   it's acceptable and merged, then perhaps we will consider the
   *easier YouTube* task as completed.
0. We're told that adding `*.youtube.com https://www.youtube.com/*` to
   "no script -> options -> advanced -> external filters -> do not
   filter objects coming from these sites" works. Let's try this and
   see how things go. [[!tag todo/test]]
0. also, [[!taglink todo/test]] the [YouTube HTML5
   Switch](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/)
   iceweasel add-on.
   * needs to be patched to accept running with FF17
   * correctly adds `&html5=1` to YouTube urls
   * this appended URL parameter seems to have no effect (with Tails
     0.17.2's browser)
0. make audio and video codecs autoplay (so that the Tails web browser
   works in a less surprising way, especially for new users; also, the
   idea is that when one goes to a page with audio or video objects,
   they want to read them more often than not)

Alternatives
============

* [[todo/Flash_support]]
* [YouTube Video Download for
  Greasemonkey](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/62634)

Test report
===========

Test report #1
--------------

With Tails 0.18, I visited one of the featured videos on youtube which
is <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK_eKGK4JrM>.

At first it gave me the usual msg flash player, then I added
`&html5=1` on the URL and refreshed the page. It worked as it should
be no issues.

After that, most of the videos played out of the box without the
`&html5=1` that where on the right side as featured/similar.

From on of them I got the msg "The browser does not currently
recognize any of the video formats available."

Later I entered <https://www.youtube.com/html5> where I verified that
my browser does not support h.264, also I had the msg "You are not
currently in the HTML5 trial." Hope that helps.

Test report #2
--------------

With Tails 0.18, I first ran `apt-get install xul-ext-greasemonkey`,
that installed the version 0.8.20100408.6-1. Iceweasel said that this
extension is not compatible with iceweasel 17.0.6.

So `apt-get remove --purge xul-ext-greasemonkey`

Then from iceweasel, I installed both 
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/> (1.8)
and <https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/87011> (version 2013.05.21)

The page <http://isebaro.com/contact/?ln=en&sb=viewtube> reads "Videos
don't play on secure URLs (HTTPS)", but even with HTTPSEverywhere and
Noscript desactivated, the video quoted in the Test repot #1 is not
working: "The video should be loading. If it doesn't load, make sure
a video plugin is installed."

It's however possible to download the video, by clicking on "Get" in
the top-right corner of the video.

Left to test:

* Try installing xul-ext-greasemonkey 0.9.20-1 from unstable
* Investigate the commit 167946958 that removes the greasemonkey
  script previously used inside Tails.
* Check if there is an answer there
