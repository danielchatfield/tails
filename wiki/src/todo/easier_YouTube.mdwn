Next steps
==========

0. remove greasemonkey and the youtube script: **done**
0. [[!taglink todo/wait]] a bit for [[todo/minitube]] to mature; if
   it's acceptable and merged, then perhaps we will consider the
   *easier YouTube* task as completed.
0. also, [[!taglink todo/test]] the [YouTube HTML5
   Switch](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/youtube-html5-switch/)
   iceweasel add-on.
0. make audio and video codecs autoplay (so that the Tails web browser
   works in a less surprising way, especially for new users; also, the
   idea is that when one goes to a page with audio or video objects,
   they want to read them more often than not)
