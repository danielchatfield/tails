Next steps
==========

0. remove greasemonkey and the youtube script: **done**
0. [[!taglink todo/wait]] a bit for [[todo/minitube]] to mature; if
   it's acceptable and merged, then perhaps we will consider the
   *easier YouTube* task as completed.
0. else, research an alternative to our old plan, which
   was *wait for Mike Perry to have NoScript fixed*, now irrelevant
   since he closed [[!tor_bug 5266]] and wrote that the "core issue
   might be that we need a better way to provide click-to-play than
   NoScript's DOM tricks..."
0. make audio and video codecs autoplay (so that the Tails web browser
   works in a less surprising way, especially for new users; also, the
   idea is that when one goes to a page with audio or video objects,
   they want to read them more often than not)
