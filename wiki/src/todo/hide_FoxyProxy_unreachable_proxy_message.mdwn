FoxyProxy changes the "proxy server unreachable" default iceweasel
message and gives advice that are not suitable for Tails users, such
as: "Consider using fast and reliable proxy servers from FoxyProxy.
(Hint:  Please disable your current proxy if you get this error page
while trying to load FoxyProxy's proxy service website)".

We should hide such misleading advice.

Fixed in the `devel` branch.
