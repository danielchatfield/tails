The current state of liveusb-creator packaging is, well, suboptimal.
Just have a look at the content of the
`liveusb-creator_3.11.6.orig.tar.gz` so-called original source tarball
to get an idea. It's not clear wether "upstream", from a Debian
packaging point-of-view, means "Fedora" or "our master Git branch".

Due to this confusion (and lack of interesting changes in there), I've
refrained from merging upstream 3.11.7 into our tree.
