T(A)ILS on an Intel-based Mac defaults to a PC keyboard configuration.
It is presumably not hard to detect the hardware is made by Apple and
setup a Mac keyboard layout accordingly.

Implementation notes:

- this should be done in live-config rather than in our own code
- the Debian Installer probably knows how to do this.
