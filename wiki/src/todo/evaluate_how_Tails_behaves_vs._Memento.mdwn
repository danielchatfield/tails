The [Memento: Learning Secrets from Process
Footprints](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak12memento.pdf)
paper, by Suman Jana and Vitaly Shmatikov, "describe(s) a new
side-channel attack. By tracking changes in the application's memory
footprint, a concurrent process belonging to a different user can
learn its secrets".

We should read it and evaluate how Tails behaves on this front,
e.g. since [[todo/hidepid]] was introduced.

As Roger Dingledine puts it, it's "not so big an issue while tails
doesn't pretend to solve that problem; but once we start playing the
VM game, you'll want to have read that paper; (or even the process
isolation game)".

For further steps, Roger also says "if you still have that question
when you've read it (i haven't read all of it), i can put you in touch
with the author".
