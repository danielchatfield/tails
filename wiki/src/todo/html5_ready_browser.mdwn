Could a more recent browser with support for html5 be included in the
image? There are plenty of html5 supporting browsers that are open
source, and it doesn't have to be the default browser, but html5
replaces a lot of what flash does, without the cost to privacy that
flash carries.

> Agreed. I'm in favor of [[shipping Tails with Firefox 4|Iceawesel_4.x]] as soon as
> compatible versions of all our extensions are compatible with it.
> We've been testing this recently and only had a few compatibility
