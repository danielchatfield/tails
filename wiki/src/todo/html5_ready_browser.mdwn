Could a more recent browser with support for html5 be included in the
image? There are plenty of html5 supporting browsers that are open
source, and it doesn't have to be the default browser, but html5
replaces a lot of what flash does, without the cost to privacy that
flash carries.

# Implementation


This is now implemented in our `feature/ff4`, that uses
a [greasemonkey
script](https://www.userscripts.org/scripts/review/105433) to opt-in
for the YouTube HTML5 trial program. For the record, this problem is
being researched at [[!tor_bug 3347]] for TBB.
