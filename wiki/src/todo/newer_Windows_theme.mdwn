For [[!taglink release/2.0]], we want a Windows 7 or 8 theme.

[[!taglink todo/research]] for a suitable theme.

## Candidate Windows 7 themes

* [Win2-7](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Win2-7+Pack?content=113264)
  from [GNOME-Look.org](http://gnome-look.org). Waiting for a response
  from the person who posted to see if backporting to Debian 6 is
  possible and/or the limitations/issues that may be encountered.
