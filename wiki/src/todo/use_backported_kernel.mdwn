The kernel from Debian Squeeze is usually backported and uploaded
quite fast to <http://backports.org> by members of the Debian kernel
team. Using them, until Lenny-and-an-half is released, would help
supporting newer hardware.

amnesia already fetches some packages from <http://backports.org>, so
this should be quite easy to implement.

OTOH, Daniel Baumann said on the Debian Live ML (20091107) that "lenny
backports as available from backports.org is not suitable for
debian-live (missing modules)."

[[!tag todo/research]]

Existing backports are not always updated in a timely manner when
security holes are discovered => wait for Squeeze instead =>
[[!taglink todo/done]].
