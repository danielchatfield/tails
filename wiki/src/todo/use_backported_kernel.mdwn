The kernel from Debian Squeeze is usually backported and uploaded
quite fast to <http://backports.org> by members of the Debian kernel
team. Using them, until Lenny-and-an-half is released, would help
supporting newer hardware.

amnesia already fetches some packages from <http://backports.org>, so
this should be quite easy to implement.

OTOH, Daniel Baumann said on the Debian Live ML (20091107) that "lenny
backports as available from backports.org is not suitable for
debian-live (missing modules)."

On the other hand, existing backports are not always updated in a
timely manner when security holes are discovered.
