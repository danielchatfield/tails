All those hotkeys do not need to be available from Tails Greeter.

Klondike hotkey
===============

Add solitaire, vanilla clone identical in appearance to Windows standard.

Nobody finds it odd or suspicious that someone is playing klondike.

Would be handy to have a hotkey, something like meta+k to start or
switch to klondike.

# Which one?

Quick benchmarking for that:

- vgacardgames: didn't manage to start it. It asks for mouse
  configuration. I gave up quickly.
- aisleriot: GNOME, asks for 21,4 MB of additional disk space. It looks
  quite different from the Windows version. There seem to be a "Card
  theme" option but selecting it in the menu doesn't trigger anything.
  In Squeeze, it's part of the `gnome-games` package. In Wheezy, it has
  it's own package.
- pysolfc: asks for 19.7 MB of additional disk space. It comes with 100
  card games and I guess we could make it lighter somehow. The look is
  quite heavily customizable and I managed to make it look pretty much
  like the Windows version.
- kpat: asks for 14.1 MB of additional disk space. It can also be
  customize to look quite much like Windows and the full-screen version is
  nicer (centered).

# Next things to do

[[!tag todo/research]]

1. update packages sizes to have the .deb size, not installed size
1. decide which one to install
1. how to bind a key?
1. preload at startup?

Low-contrast hotkey
===================

An extremely low contrast screen setting that makes it difficult to
read the screen without sitting directly in front of it.

This could possibly be enabled from the More Options pane of Tails
Greeter, just like the WinXP Camoflage option is.

Along with this, a special hotkey that toggles the low contrast
screen setting, in an emergency.

But that's low-priority.

Font resizer hotkey
===================

A simple gconftool script that instantly changes all of the fonts
to size 6, again making it difficult to read the screen without
sitting directly in front of it.

This could possibly be enabled from the More Options pane of Tails
Greeter, just like the WinXP Camoflage option is.

Also a special hotkey that toggles the font resizer in an emergency.

But that's low-priority.
