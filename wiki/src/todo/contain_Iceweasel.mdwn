Iceweasel probably has one the biggest attack surface exposed by Tails
to a network attacker, so anything we can do to make it harder, for an
attacker, to escalate from "browser exploited" to "whole system
under's attacker control", is welcome.

When a container-based solution (e.g. LXC or `unshare(1)`) becomes
a viable, *secure* solution for creating isolated jails, the chroot
approach used by the unsafe browser will be quite easily adaptable
to Iceweasel.

Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for user namespaces to be part of Linux
(3.8, likely) and a userspace interface to be ready.
