**Next thing to do**: [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Tails to be based on Jessie.

When we ship file-roller 3.6 or newer, we should stop installing
`unrar-free` as `unar` will be used instead. Unfortunately,
Wheezy will have 3.4, so that will be for Jessie.

See [[todo/have_archive_manager_support_rar_again]] for details.
