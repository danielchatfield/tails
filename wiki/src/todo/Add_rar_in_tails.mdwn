Hey Tail developers. 

Last night i d/l a rar file in tails, i was not able to open it and
get its content. The included extraction tool do not support rar. And
i cannot install it with apt-get install. zip works fine along with
alot others. But not rar as a gui tool. I hope this can be added in
the next release.
