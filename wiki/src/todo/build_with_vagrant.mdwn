[[!meta title="Build with Vagrant"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

In order to enable more people to contribute to Tails, and to get started more
quickly, we should support building Tails in a pre-configured virtual machine
using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).

The `feature/vagrant` branch has been merged in `devel` and `experimental`
on 2012-05-22.

Left to be done
===============

Upstream Vagrant
----------------

[[!tag todo/code]]

Vagrant does not support any way to verify a remote *base box*. We have made a
quick and dirty monkey-patch to add a better behaviour, but proper work should
be done to get such feature in upstream Vagrant.

Upstream Veewee
---------------

[[!tag todo/code]]

The definition for the Veewee *basebox* is fully generic for a Squeeze
installation. It should be sent to Veewee upstream.

Veewee being unusable when using `gem --user` should also be reported.
