[[!toc levels=2]]

In order to enable more people to contribute to Tails, and to get started more
quickly, we should support building Tails in a pre-configured virtual machine
using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/).

The `feature/vagrant` branch has been merged in `devel` and `experimental`
on 2012-05-22.
