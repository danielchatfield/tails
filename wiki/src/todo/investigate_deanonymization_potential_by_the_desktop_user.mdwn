Arbitrary code execution as the desktop (`amnesia`) user gives ways to
an attacker to deanonymize a Tails user. This is a problem we might
want to fix.

Roadmap
=======

1. [[!taglink todo/research]] how easy it is to conduct such attacks
   via the Tor controller, once given arbitrary code exec as the
   `amnesia` user (The desktop user is allowed to fiddle with Tor
   settings with Vidalia. E.g. a selection of bridges picked by the
   attacker is probably enough to deanonymize the user.)
1. [[!taglink todo/research]] what other kinds of deanonymization
   attacks are available to an attacker who can run arbitrary code as
   the `amnesia` user
1. Then, think what kind of defenses we can set up against these
   classes of attacks, cost/benefit analysis etc.
