Our `feature/ff4` Git branch installs Iceweasel 4.x from the Debian
Mozilla team's APT repository.

Next things to do
=================

[[!tag todo/code]]

- HTTPS-Everywhere: need to be upgraded to at least 0.9.7
- CS Lite 1.4: need to be upgraded or replaced, see
  [[todo/iceweasel_addon_-_CS_Lite]]

Blocking
========

We won't ship Iceweasel 4.x until a released stable Torbutton supports
it. Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]].
