Persistent bookmarks for iceweasel has been requested several
times. They are stored in
`~/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE/bookmarks.html`, so we need to make that
file, and *only* that file, persistent; making the rest of the
iceweasel profile persistent will prevent users from getting important
configuration changes in new Tails releases. The `link` persistence
option seems like a proper fit for this.

Currently the iceweasel profile are generated on post-build, when it's
started for the first time, and `$PROFILE` is random
(`XXXXXXXX.default`). Randomness in paths doesn't go well with how our
persistence is configurated.

The way to go seems to be:

* Generate a profile at build time. To avoid randomness in the path we
  need to rename the profile to something static, e.g. a chroot_local
  hook (which are run as `root`):

    1. `iceweasel -CreateProfile default`
    2. `mv ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default ~/.mozilla/firefox/default`
    3. `sed -i "s@Path=.*\.default@Path=default@"
        ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini`
    4. `mv ~/.mozilla /etc/skel`

  Currently a fresh iceweasel profile occupies ~2 MB space
  uncompressed, or ~400 KB bzip2'd, so the iso won't grow
  significantly.

* Make a preset: `/home/amnesia/.mozilla/firefox/default
  link,source=bookmarks`

* Copy the initial `bookmarks.html` into the persistent source. This
  will require a hook associated with the preset in
  `tails-persistence-setup`: the hook is run after the bookmarks
  preset has been "turned on", and it looks if
  `/live/persistent/$DEV/bookmarks/bookmarks.html` exists; if it does
  (e.g. it the preset was setup before, but turned off for some
  reason) nothing is done; and if not it's copied from `~/.mozilla`
  (which may contain bookmarks the user made during the session) or
  the skeleton profile.
