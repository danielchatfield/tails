The way to go seems to be:

* Generate a profile at build time. To avoid randomness in the path we
  need to rename the profile to something static, e.g. a chroot_local
  hook (which are run as `root`):

    1. `iceweasel -CreateProfile default`
    2. `mv ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default ~/.mozilla/firefox/default`
    3. `sed -i "s@Path=.*\.default@Path=default@"
        ~/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini`
    4. `mv ~/.mozilla /etc/skel`

  Currently a fresh iceweasel profile occupies ~2 MB space
  uncompressed, or ~400 KB bzip2'd, so the iso won't grow
  significantly.

* Make `places.sqlite` persistent. This can be done by replacing the regular
  file in the profile directory with a symlink to a a file in a persistent
  directory. When the symlink points to a non-existent file, Iceweasel will
  happily recreate it from the default set of bookmarks.

This has been implemented in the `feature/persistent_bookmarks` branch.
Merged for Tails 0.15.
