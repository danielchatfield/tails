As [previously said on the forum](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Why_No_Screenshot_App__63__), some users would like Tails to ship a screenshot package.

Another rationale in this direction is that taking a screenshot is an important way to grab informations, for example to report a bug.

gnome-screenshot should be fine : 352 ko unpacked

> As a counterargument, it's already possible to do screenshots with
> Gimp, and the same options.

>> Given gnome-screenshot is tiny and well integrated with the desktop
>> (keybinding) compared to the equivalent Gimp feature, we decided to
>> include it in Tails.
