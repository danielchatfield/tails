Explain why Tails ships Tor vs. other `$ANONYMIZING_SOFTWARE`.
Somewhere: contributors FAQ? users FAQ? design doc?

Late 2012, we explained AdvOR drawbacks on the forum:

> AdvOR was forked from mainline Tor around three years ago. Given how
> its sources are published (just a .zip, no source control AFAICT)
> it's very hard to follow up on any changes it introduces, and any
> (important) changes from mainline Tor it *does not* include.
> There's little (none?) documentation either.
>
> This and the author's complete absense in the Tor community are some
> pretty strong warning signs, IMHO. Not to mention that any
> difference in behaviour from mainline Tor will put AdvOR users into
> their own relatively tiny partition of \"Tor\" users, which sucks
> for anonymity. Also see [Nick Mathewson's (Tor's Chief Architect)
> analysis](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00026.html)
> for some enlightenment.
