Rationale
=========

The Tor DNS resolver T(A)ILS is currently using lacks support for most
types of DNS queries except "A". A better user experience would be
provided if T(A)ILS was able to resolve any kind of DNS queries out of
the box.

Implementation
==============

Inserting ttdnsd into the DNS resolver loop is the obvious solution.
ttdnsd listens for UDP DNS requests and forwards these via the Tor
SOCKS proxy to an open recursive DNS resolver on the Internet.

But we cannot just replace pdnsd with ttdnsd as the latter, unlike the
former, does no caching at all. The DNS resolution process could then
be:

    resolv.conf -> DNS forwarding+caching proxy -> ttdnsd -> Tor

Forwarding+caching DNS proxy candidates:

- dnsmasq
- pdnsd: already installed on T(A)ILS
- unbound
