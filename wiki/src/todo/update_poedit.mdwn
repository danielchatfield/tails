Tails ships poedit 1.4.2

Poedit 1.5 is [now available](https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/blob/master/NEWS), and claims to [fix the annoying wordwraping problem](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25), among other improvements.

It is now in Debian unstable (no chance to land into official
squeeze-backports due to the Wheezy freeze).

It was tested, and confirmed it does not mess up with line
breaks anymore.

We now should update Poedit in Tails.

> Implemented in `feature/poedit-1.5`, [[!taglink todo/done]] in 0.16.
