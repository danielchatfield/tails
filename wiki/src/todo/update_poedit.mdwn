Tails ships poedit 1.4.2

Poedit 1.5 is [now available](https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/blob/master/NEWS), and claims to [fix the annoying wordwraping problem](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25), among other improvements.

It is now in Debian unstable (no chance to land into official
squeeze-backports due to the Wheezy freeze).

We now should:

1. [[!taglink todo/test]] it
1. backport it
1. update Poedit in Tails
