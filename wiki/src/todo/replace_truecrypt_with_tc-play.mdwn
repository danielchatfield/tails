[tc-play](https://github.com/bwalex/tc-play) is a Free implementation
of TrueCrypt based on dm-crypt, licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.

It is in Debian sid ([[!debpts tcplay]]), and would serve as a full
replacement of TrueCrypt... once a proper GUI available.
Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]], then.

On the other hand, [cryptsetup 1.6 supports reading the TrueCrypt
on-disk format](https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/wiki/Cryptsetup160),
so if/when udisks and friends are adapted (if needed), then we could
as well avoid shipping any additional software at all. Let's
[[!taglink todo/test]] this.

Zulucrypt is doing that: <https://code.google.com/p/zulucrypt/> but it's
not packaged in Debian.
