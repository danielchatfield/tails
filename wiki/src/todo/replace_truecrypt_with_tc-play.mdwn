[tc-play](https://github.com/bwalex/tc-play) is a Free implementation
of TrueCrypt, licensed under the 2-clause BSD license. It would serve
as a full replacement of TrueCrypt, at least when:

1. The linux port is stable enough (it was originally developed for
   DragonFlyBSD).
2. There's a proper GUI available.
