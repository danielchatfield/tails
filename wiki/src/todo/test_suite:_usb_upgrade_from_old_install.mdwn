Currently we upgrade Tails from the same version in
`usb_install.feature`, which isn't what's said in the manual test
suite.

We could save an installed USB disk image at some point (in a step or by a
jenkins trick?), and have it stored somewhere accessible to the test suite so
that it's used in the tests of the next version of Tails. Should be accessible
also for people willing to test this feature.

Alternatively we can add an `--old-iso` option to `run_test_suite`,
which, if omitted, defaults to the .iso with oldest mtime. If the
current and "old" ISO images are the same we get a fatal
error. Actually, since mtime is not really reliable, we should extract
the image creation date via:

    /sbin/blkid -p -s LABEL -o value /path/to/iso
