**WARNING**: we might want to switch to another MUA, see
[[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]].

Needs to be fixed
=================

[[!tag todo/test todo/code]]

The real IP address is in the Received mail header fields and the
EHLO/HELO packets sent by Thunderbird.

Possible solutions:

- Torbutton (the old 1.0.4.x branch which still supported
  Thunderbird): not maintained anymore, the [torbutton
  FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/faq.html.en#thunderbird)
  advises not to use it
- ProxyButton: no release since early 2008, not in Debian
- [FoxyProxy](http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/): the Debian package only
  supports iceweasel, whereas upstream advertises icedove support

Already checked
