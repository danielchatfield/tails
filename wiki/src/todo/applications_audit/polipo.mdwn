A bunch of anonymity, privacy and security issues in Polipo were fixed
in Christopher Davis' branch (git://repo.or.cz/polipo.git) and never
merged upstream.

Even if we'll [[todo/stop_using_polipo_in_iceweasel]], but we should
check if these issues affect Tails.

# dontIdentifyToClients

Christopher added the `dontIdentifyToClients` option (commits:
80b45940, be116b5, c78beb81) to fix [[!tor_bug 1082]]. When set to
true, "Polipo tries to avoid transmitting local host name, port, and
time zone".

1. *hostname* and *port*: Tails sets `proxyName = "localhost"` and
   `proxyPort = 8118` just like the Tor Browser Bundle does => nothing
   critical could be leaked - at worse, leaking this information
   restricts the practical anonymity set to the best one Tails can try
   putting its users into => **non-issue**.

2. Leaking *timezone* information to the outside world would be much
   more annoying: Tails' web browser has been trying to spoof a EN-US
   browser since 0.7 for a reason. However, that information can only
   be transmitted to a HTTP client connected to Polipo; practically
   speaking, such a client can be any non-SOCKS-aware applications
   shipped in Tails; most have other means to gather that information
   anyway, but e.g. untrusted JavaScript in the web browser might be
   used to access the aforementioned information and leak it =>
   **[[!taglink todo/research]]** how to fix this (probably by
   patching Polipo and pushing that patch
   [upstream](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/polipo-users)
   and/or to Debian; avoiding to ship Polipo at all would be even
   better, but we're not here yet)

# others?

Security issues that were not privacy-related have supposedly already
been applied to the 1.0.4.1-1.1 polipo package shipped in Debian
Squeeze. This should be double-checked, though
=> **[[!taglink todo/research]]**.
