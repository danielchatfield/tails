Message-ID
==========

When the following account preferences are set, no private information
is used to generate Message-ID headers:

        set_domain=1
        domain=localhost

Else, Message-ID's end with `@amnesia`, which is clearly suboptimal,
but not too bad.

EHLO/HELO
=========

Outgoing EHLO/HELO SMTP commands can also leak private information
(see [this or-talk thread about
it](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Aug-2008/msg00261.html)).

With or without `domain` trick, claws-mail seems to always say `EHLO localhost`.

HTML / Javascript
=================

Optional plugins (fancy, dillo, html2, etc.) can render HTML e-mail.
Without any of them, claws-mail does basic HTML formatting (e.g.
links) by default. The `render_html` prefs item, when set to false,
fully disables HTML rendering.
