Gregory Fleischer did a talk
([PDF](http://pseudo-flaw.net/resource/defcon/attach:/defcon-17-fleischer.pdf))
called *Attacking Tor at the Application Layer* at defcon 17.

Tails should be audited against the issues he rose. The [online
demos](http://pseudo-flaw.net/content/defcon/dc-17-demos/)
will probably be of great help.
