When we merged `feature/automated_tests/cucumber` into `stable`, we've
reverted commit `255aa71` ("Make sure the memory dumping debug message

release at the time. However, the `erase_memory` feature depends on
it, so we now must consider reverting that revert.

Let's first determine whether `255aa71` is safe or even
the right approach.
