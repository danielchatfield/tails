Having an ISO in CD size (700mb or under) create a larger pool of suitable machine to 
run it, as machines with older spec usually only equipted with CD/CDRW drive are very common in developing countries, who needs this type of distro more then those who live in the developed countries, and can afford very recent machines.

Having tested the older CD size Tails, they run quite well with machines in the socket A/socket 754 range with 512 mb of memories.

Furthermore, some of the applications included seems to be little used. For example  open/libre office and GIMP. And a general sliming down of the distro to the essential items and focus on the anonymous web access will probable keep its size at CD level.
