[Anomos](http://anomos.info/) is a pseudonymous, encrypted multi-P2P
file sharing protocol, originally based on BitTorrent.

Features:

* pseudonymous, Encrypted BitTorrent
* "Secure" Tracker and Client (<-- what does this mean?)
* GPL
* Censorship resistant

> There's been no release nor blog post nor change in
> [Anomos Git repository](http://git.anomos.info/?p=anomos.git) since
> September of 2010, and a few links in their website top bar lead
> to 404. Not totally reassuring, to say the least.

> There's some confusion on their website between "anonymous" and
> "pseudonymous"; the end-user talk in front say "anonymous", but the
> more technical parts rather use the "pseudonymous" word.

> How well does it work over Tor?

>> The lack of upstream is a sufficient reason not to include it, closing.
