# 3.11 Fingerprint

Tails tries to make it as difficult as possible to distinguish
Tails users from other Tor users.

Iceweasel is configured to match the fingerprint of the Tor
Browser Bundle and the known differences, if any, are listed in the
[[known issues|support/known_issues]] page.

However the fact that different extensions are installed in Tails
and in the TBB surely allows more sophisticated attacks that usual
fingerprint as returned by tools such as
<https://panopticlick.eff.org/> and <http://ip-check.info/>. For
example, the fact that Adblock is removing ads could be analysed.

From the point of view of the local network administrator, Tails
is almost exclusively generating Tor activity and that is probably
quite different from other TBB users. We believe this would be hard
to avoid. Other possible fingerprint issues on the LAN or ISP exist
but we believe they would be harder to detect. See the discussion
on fingerprinting in the [[Time
sync|contribute/design/Time_syncing]] design document and the 
[[fingerprint|doc/about/fingerprint]] documentation.

Proposed change:

soon
