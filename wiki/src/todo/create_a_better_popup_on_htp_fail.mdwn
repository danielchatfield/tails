Currently when it fails the user is shown a popup with the log of the
last execution of HTP. This could be improved by:

  - Not showing the raw logs in the second popup but a nicer explanation
    on the issue with a link to a relevant wiki page, like:

    « Synchronizing the system's clock failed!
    You won't be able to access the Internet.
    __Try to fix it__.

    « Failed to synchronize the clock!
    There might be something wrong with your Internet connectivity
    and Tor might not work correctly.
    __Learn how to fix it__. »
