Since the transparent firewall-level torification is gone, Tails now
uses `torify` more and more. Given Tails does not include `torsocks`,
`torify` uses `tsocks`, which is unmaintained upstream, and makes
`torify` display scary messages such as *WARNING: tsocks is known to
leak DNS and UDP data. If you had torsocks we would use that.*.
Not displaying that meaningless message would save some
user-support time.

1. install `torsocks` (probably 1.2-3 or later from squeeze-backports):
   **done** in `feature/torsocks`
1. test that every program that's torified using `torify` still works
   correctly: as of Tails 0.11, `git grep -w torify` points us to
   whois (tested OK), claws-mail (tested OK), gobby (tested OK) and gobby-0.5
   (tested OK): **done**
1. go on shipping the tsocks package (so that ttdns gets the library
   it needs), *but* drop the `/usr/bin/tsocks` binary so that users
   stop complaining about it not being well configured: **done**

(Upstream has removed support in Tor 0.2.3.14-alpha for `tsocks` in the `torify` script. So this needs to be done before getting Tor 0.2.3 in Tails.)

Merged into devel, [[!taglink pending]] for Tails 0.12.
