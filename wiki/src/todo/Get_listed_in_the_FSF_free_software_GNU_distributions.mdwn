In a distribution that has non-free software, privacy and anonymity
are at risk. As TAILS is a distribution that protects the privacy and
anonymity of its users, it is implied that it will include and
recommend only free software. ~ Quiliro

>> No. I don't mean open. That is an entirely different movement. I mean free as in freedom. ~ Quiliro

The Free Software Foundation currently holds a list of GNU
distributions that do not use or recommend non-free software.
TAILS could be listed there and promote its use by activists and other
users that value privacy and anonymity. ~ Quiliro

>>> This second comment is more exact and more relevant. The non-free blobs might render the software non-anonymous and non-private. They could contain software that reports on its users and discover information on communication. ~ Quiliro

>>> My Tails plays MP3s and a rich selection of Video formats. I believe few of these is "free" (according to FSF definition/decree)

> There are plenty of other (higher profile) opportunities to promote Tails.

> Indeed it is, but it is important that tails firmware blobs are at least open even if not free. Perhaps a compromise could be reached however. 
> Tails image could be splited in the future. This could allow for a "core" tails with repositories (one of them could be the proprietary one). There are working free distros such as gnewsense and trisquel, if a tails user failed his/her hardware with this core tails, the firmware blobs (and/or themes and other packages) could be downloaded possibly through the incremental (or should I say optional in this case?) upgrades package.
> In the end every user would win, but although OP point is somewhat valid and tails could benefit from including only free software, usability being badly sacrificed in order to be included in a list..well probably not a good idea ;)
> As a bonus perhaps the proposed solution could allow "core tails" to fit in a cd again. Just an idea ~ Hypothesys

>> This is an oxymoron. TAILS cannot be free (as in freedom) without being opensource. The issue is:
>> * Non-free software = security risk.
>> * TAILS with non-free software = security risk.
>> * Is TAILS willing to solve this bug or prove it is not a security risk? ~ Quiliro

>>> It is not an oxymoron. No software can be free (as in freedom) without being open-source. The "issue" is: you've gone on to muddle *free* and *open* (again)
