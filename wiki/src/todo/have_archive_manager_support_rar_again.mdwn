Ooops. We've replaced the non-free unrar with *The Unarchiver*,
which can be used on the command-line (command is `unar`). Too bad
the GNOME archive manager [does not
know](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=646606) about it.
This should be fixed [[!taglink todo/upstream]].

Another workaround is to install unrar yourself:
`apt-get update && apt-get install unrar`
