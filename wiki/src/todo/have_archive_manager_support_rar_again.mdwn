Ooops. We've replaced the non-free unrar with *The Unarchiver*,
which can be used on the command-line (command is `unar`). Too bad
the GNOME archive manager < 3.6 [does not
know](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=646606) about it.

(A temporary workaround is to install unrar yourself:
`apt-get update && apt-get install unrar`)

> Squeeze's file-roller knows how to use `unrar-free`, so in the
> meantime, shall we ship `unrar-free` again, to get at least RARv2
> support in the GUI? (In addition to The Unarchiver that supports
> RARv3 on the command-line.)

>> We decided to install unrar-free again,
>> and [[remove it|todo/remove_unrar-free]] once we ship file-roller
>> 3.6 or newer.

>>> Implemented in devel, implemented in 0.13.
