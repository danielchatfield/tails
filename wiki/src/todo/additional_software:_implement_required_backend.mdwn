Approach: offline install of a package list, upgrade when/if a working Internet
connection appears later

- store in persitence root a file containing a list of packages to install from
  persistence (e.g. `live-persistent-packageslist.conf`)
- install packages possibly offline after the greeter and before the session
  starts with `apt-get install --force-yes` (might break some packages, but
  should be OK for most) but without `apt-get upgrade`
- once network pops up, if the packages persistence is enabled, look for
  upgrades (`apt-get update`, `apt-get install $PACKAGELIST`). For some
  packages (e.g. already running app) the change will only be effective at next
  boot but a outdated version won't stay too long.

This is done in the branch `feature/remember_installed_packages`,
and was merged for Tails 0.18.
