Read in Vidalia 0.2.12 announce: "Add support for Tor's ControlSocket
as an alternative to ControlPort. It can be used for Linux maintainers
to build a better default interaction between Tor and Vidalia by just
setting the right permissions and file owner on the socket file for
the connection. Using ControlSocket means you don't need to worry
about authentication methods with ControlPort."

This probably can make Tails source a bit simpler: no need to set a
custom `CookieAuthFile`.

We now need to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for [[!debbug 552556]] to be
fixed (unlikely to happen before Tor 0.2.2 is turned into a stable
release).
