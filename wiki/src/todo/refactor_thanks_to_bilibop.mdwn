bilibop adds some nice bonus:

- if the symlink `/dev/bilibop` exists, it means the system is running
  from a writable media (USB, MMC and the like, but not DVD);
- if you don't like 'bilibop' but prefer 'Tails' or 'bootdev', just
  set up `BILIBOP_COMMON_BASENAME` to the value of your choice in
  `/etc/bilibop/bilibop.conf`

This could be used to refactor and simplify stuff.
