Tails 0.14 has basic [[contribute/design/stream_isolation]],
implemented in a way that all activity in the web browser may
share circuits.

Mike Perry's plans for torbrowser: per-tab SOCKS username, or
increment the username when the New Identity button is clicked, or
similar. But FF has a SOCKS username / password handling bug that
prevents us from having per-tab stream isolation, so this is likely to
happen as a Torbrowser patch FF: [[!tor_bug 3455]]. So on this front,
we must first [[todo/replace_iceweasel_with_Torbrowser]].
