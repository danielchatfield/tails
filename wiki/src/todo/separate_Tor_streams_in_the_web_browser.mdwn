Tails 0.14 has basic [[contribute/design/stream_isolation]],
implemented in a way that all activity in the web browser may
share circuits.

Mike Perry's plans for torbrowser: [[!tor_bug 5752]], aka. *Isolate
browser streams by domain rather than by time interval*.

(Details: per-tab SOCKS username, or increment the username when the
New Identity button is clicked, or similar. But FF has a SOCKS
username / password handling bug that prevents us from having per-tab
stream isolation, so this is likely to happen as a Torbrowser patch
FF: [[!tor_bug 3455]].)
