Visited an English speaking open-publishing website
(http://atlanta.indymedia.org/), started to publish
=> dictionary is automatically set to French (Luxembourg) in the main textarea.

Looking around on the web, it looks like it's expected that iceweasel
picks any seemingly random dictionary as the default one.

Implemented in `bugfix/fix_default_iceweasel_spelling_language`,
[[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.17.

But the fix is not perfect, see
[[todo/select_localized_Iceweasel_search_engine]].
