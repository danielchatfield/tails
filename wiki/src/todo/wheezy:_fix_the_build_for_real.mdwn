Fix the build for real (workaround'd in 4218f2e4): at `lb source` time, when `lb 
chroot_sources install` wants to run `apt-get upgrade`, it fails the build with 
`The value 'wheezy' is invalid for APT::Default-Release as such a release is not 
available in the sources` (due to the APT proxy not being configured at this 
time, the last `apt-get update` failed and the package indices are empty). If 
one simply removes `APT::Default-Release`, then the pinning is broken when 
indices are not available. Actually, if `lb source` just exited early unless 
`LB_SOURCE` is enabled, we would not have this problem.
