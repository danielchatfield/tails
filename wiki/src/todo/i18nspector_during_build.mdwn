Run i18nspector during the ISO build process to catch errors in the PO
files for our custom scripts.

  - PO files are to be found in
    `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/locale/`
  - the call to `check_po.sh` or i18nspector should be added to
    `auto/build`, e.g. right after the call to `./refresh-translations`
