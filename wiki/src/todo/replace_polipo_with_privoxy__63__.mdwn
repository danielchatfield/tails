Privoxy + Tor configuration examples:

* according to Jacob, the Tor project uses Privoxy when they need
  a HTTP proxy; he sent us a configuration file he trusts to be safe
  using with Tor in the "Switch to Privoxy?" thread on tails-dev (Sun,
  25 Mar 2012 11:12:12 -0700) and another one, based on Liberté's one
  but simplified (Sun, 25 Mar 2012 23:15:11 +0200)
* Orbot uses Privoxy
* Liberté uses Privoxy
