Having a PO file editor in T(A)ILS would be a huge bonus e.g. for
contributors who want to translate this very wiki or other T(A)ILS
specific software.

Likely candidates are:

- poedit: multi-platform (7.6MB added to the chroot size)
- Gtranslator (2.5MB added to the chroot size)

Both seem reasonably usable and small enough to be included.

According to the Debian popularity contest: poedit
([popcon](http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=poedit)) seems to
have stolen half of the gtranslator
([popcon](http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=gtranslator)) users
in 2008-2010.

=> installing poedit => [[!taglink todo/done]]
