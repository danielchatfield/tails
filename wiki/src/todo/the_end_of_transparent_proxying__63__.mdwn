Instead of transparently proxying them through Tor, we can probably
simply deny outgoing non-torified connections to the Internet, for
reasons discussed [[on the forum|forum/Tails_Fatal_Flaw..or_not??]].

This change was made in `feature/no_transparent_proxy` Git branch.

> [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.10.

Ignored
=======

* GNOME VFS FTP (was working in 0.9 using the Tor SOCKS proxy): let's
  ignore it for Tails 0.10 as we'll get [[todo/FTP_in_Iceweasel]].
* Seahorse only works for hidden services, "thanks" to the Tor automap
  on resolve feature: FIXME upstream bug report.

Non-issues
==========

Known issues that are not regressions:

* [[iceweasel FTP|todo/FTP_in_Iceweasel]] (additionally, this is
  repaired by `feature/ff4`)
* wget FTP

Tested ok
=========
