Hello,

this is basically a question :) I don't know how to tag it properly.
As far as I understand HTP is critical only to provide a somehow
accurate system clock to Tor.

Downsides are a (small) hole in the Firewall, an additional program
HTP that might contain additional bugs, and connections to some
servers which might make fingerprinting for Tails users more easy (HTP
is only a short connection and even if someone can't see the encrypted
traffic, such short connections do look a bit odd when investigating)
and provides a easy to detect pattern for a wiretapper watching a
machine running Tails. Interface goes up, one of some web servers is
DNSed, then connected via a short encrypted HTTP session, and then Tor
traffic.

My question is, are there so many machines with wrong clocks that
justify these "downsides" (exaggerating a bit) for all Tails users and
administrative work for the Tails developers?

If it's only a few users, could it be more convenient to provide them
an option in the upcoming greeter or at boot time to provide a date or
let them just set it up in gnome?
