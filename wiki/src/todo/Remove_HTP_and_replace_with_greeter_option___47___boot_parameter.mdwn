Hello,

this is basically a question :) I don't know how to tag it properly.
As far as I understand HTP is critical only to provide a somehow
accurate system clock to Tor.

Downsides are a (small) hole in the Firewall, an additional program
HTP that might contain additional bugs, and connections to some
servers which might make fingerprinting for Tails users more easy (HTP
is only a short connection and even if someone can't see the encrypted
traffic, such short connections do look a bit odd when investigating)
and provides a easy to detect pattern for a wiretapper watching a
machine running Tails. Interface goes up, one of some web servers is
DNSed, then connected via a short encrypted HTTP session, and then Tor
traffic.

My question is, are there so many machines with wrong clocks that
justify these "downsides" (exaggerating a bit) for all Tails users and
administrative work for the Tails developers?

If it's only a few users, could it be more convenient to provide them
an option in the upcoming greeter or at boot time to provide a date or
let them just set it up in gnome?

Another option might be not to run it at start time (hence giving a clear "I'm using TAILS" signal), but rather with a note if initial attempt to form a connection fails, listing "check the clock, and either set it manually or run HTP from the start menu" as one of the possible debugging steps.

I think that synching the system clock is a change to the hardware, and as such goes against the whole "let's not leave any traces on the hardware unless the user OKs it" thing.

So if you're changing the hardware clock, should perhaps also be automatically changing it back to the old time offset, on power-down.
