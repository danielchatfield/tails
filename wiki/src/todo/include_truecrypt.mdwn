It would be nice if TrueCrypt is included in Live CD as it was in
Incognito. It has more features as Encrypted folders.

>> I used Incognito because it was the only Live distro with Truecrypt, Tor and OpenOffice. I do believe that TrueCrypt is free enough to be included in privacy-focused system. For me - if source is available, program is safe. More encryption available - more fun. Truecrypt is just a must-have feature.

Now that it has been made official that The (Amnesic) Incognito Live
System is Incognito's spiritual successor, we really have to make
a decision about this.

If we don't want to include TrueCrypt forever, we at least need to
provide a migration path from TrueCrypt to XXX:

- include TrueCrypt for a few months/releases so that Incognito users
  can get their TrueCrypt-encrypted data back;
- [[!taglink todo/research]], implement and possibly document
  replacement solutions.
