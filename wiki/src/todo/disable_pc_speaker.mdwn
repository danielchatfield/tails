Tails currently load the Linux modules that will enable the old
style (PC-AT) speaker. It is responsible for making loud beeps at bootup,
shutdown or when using the console. As it raises attention to Tails users
it is best to disable it.

Implemented in `feature/disable_pc_speaker`.

[[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.14.
