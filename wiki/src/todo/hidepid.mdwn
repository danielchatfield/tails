Linux' `hidepid` procfs mount option allows to restrict access to
`/proc/<pid>/` (`hidepid=1`) and, in addition, all `/proc/<pid>/` can
be made fully invisible to other users (`hidepid=2`) but the members
of the group passed with `gid=`.
See `Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt` in the Linux source
for details.

It makes it a bit harder for an attacker to gather information that
may allow them to escalate priviledges.

This feature was backported into the Debian 3.2 kernel.

In Tails 0.17 code tree, a quick check shows no code run as a non-root
user that needs to access this information, so the annoyance will be
merely for the power-users who'll need to set an administrator
password to access it... but they do it anyway to install packages,
don't they?

=> We probably want `hidepid=2` and no special `gid=` setting.
