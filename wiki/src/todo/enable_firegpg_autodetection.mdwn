FireGPG's autodetection feature is supposed to have been fixed in
recent enough versions. Are they packaged in Debian?

OTOH, it has been reported this feature did break some websites that
include e.g. GnuPG-signed content such as the cacert website.

How to test
===========

- boot Tails
- close Iceweasel
- in `/etc/iceweasel/profile/user.js`, set
  `extensions.firegpg.activate_inline` to `true`
- run `iceweasel -ProfileManager`, create and start a new profile

Testing results
===============

Using 0.6.2's FireGPG with inline detection enabled.

## CaCert

The first CaCert's PGP signature on the page is replaced with a white
empty block. The second one is left as is, until FireGPG is asked to
*Parse again this page*, which replaces the second PGP-signed message
with another empty white block.

## RoundCube

patched roundcube webmail that displays inline PGP encrypted mail =>
FireGPG does not detect the PGP content, and seems to ignore it

## SquirrelMail

### Torbutton enabled

Empty white block.

### Torbutton disabled

Works flawlessly.

## bugs.debian.org

(signed upload notification email)

### Torbutton enabled

- first page display: not autodetected
- after asking FireGPG to parse again the page: signed message is
  replaced with a white empty box

### Torbutton disabled

- after asking FireGPG to enable inline detection for this site:
  works!

Conclusions
===========

FireGPG's inline PGP content autodetection feature is not compatible
with Torbutton. Either we close this todo item or we fix this in
FireGPG or Torbutton.
