what about users that (think they might) need plausible deniability. Suppose a user that stores his really confidential stuff in a hidden container within a normal truecrypt container, whereas the outer container is used for normal/less sensitive stuff. This is not possible with LUKS encryption as far as i know

I am a brand new Linux user and I love TAILS, but will quit using it if I lose truecrypt compatibility. I have read the articles, and I understand why you are wanting to get truecrypt out of TAILS, but please don't do so without adding a 100% truecrypt compatible alternative. I need SIMPLE cross platform support, which TrueCrypt does VERY VERY well. From what I've read tc-play can be this perfect alternative, as it is basically truecrypt with a better license. Leaving truecrypt as a hidden boot option until tc-play is ready to take its place seems like a good idea to me. Again, I don't want to lose truecrypt.
