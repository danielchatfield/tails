As pointed out in
[[forum/Forum_Design___38___Functionality:_Primitive__44___Awkward]], our forum
can be improved in many ways.

- Allowing people to fill up an author name, even if not logged in. This should
  be possible with the comments_allowauthor option. See
  [http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/comments/](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/comments/):

> If true (default false), anonymous commenters may specify a name for themselves,
> and the [[!meta author]] and [[!meta authorurl]] directives will not be
> overridden by the comments plugin.

- As adviced on the same page we should consider the use of either the
  `htmlbalance` or the `htmltidy` plugin. See
  [http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmltidy/](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmltidy/)
  and
  [http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmlbalance/](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/htmlbalance/).

- Ikiwiki could be improved to provide a new sort parameter to order pages by
  the modification time of its subpages. This would imply some ikiwiki extension
  [[!tag todo/code]].

- If needed it should be possible to further restrict the open publishing and
  deletion on the forum by locking the forum pages so that only its author can
  edit it. Adding ' or forum/*' to locked_pages seems to do the tricks while
  still allowing anonymous users to create new threads.

- The 'Remove comment' link below each comment could be removed from the comment
  template.

[[!tag todo/discuss]]
