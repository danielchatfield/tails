In Tails 0.15, one cannot start the Unsafe Browser again after closing
a first instance of it:

	Error
	Another Unsafe Browser is currently running, or being cleaned up.
	Please retry in a while.

> test if this is still reproducible,
> even after waiting long enough. Perhaps that's just the closing
> notification that disappears too early?
>> Not reproductible in Tails 0.18. Seems to be fixed, closing. [[!taglink todo/done]]
