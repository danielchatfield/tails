Some users want to use [ixquick](https://ixquick.com/). There are
a few reasons to add it to iceweasel in Tails; at least:

* it seems like an acceptable fallback when Scroogle is down or broken
  by changes in Google web search;
* it's "proxy" feature allows to visit web pages that block Tor users.

This is *not* about making it the default search engine is another
discussion, though; see the [[forum thread|forum/Please_add_ixquick_to_the_search]] about it.

> [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.11.
