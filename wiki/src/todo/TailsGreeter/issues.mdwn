# Regressions

## Set console keyboard layout

If user choose locale, than console should be localized as well.

> The console is localized once the login/password was entered.
> That means the user must know how to type the login/password in
> QWERTY, which is a regression.

# Bugs

## Wrong initial widget size

E.g. when I select "FranÃ§ais" as a language, presumably because of long
keyboard layout variants names, the combo boxes column grows a lot.
The size of the widgets should be adjusted to the max. possible width
before initial display.

## Text gets hidden when language is selected

Language & layout panel is not autoresized correctly so some of the
widgets (most notably - entry field to test keyboard layout) are
beyond window borders.

## Insane widgets used for long lists

Comboboxes with long lists are hard to use - should be done the same
way as GDM3 in Debian Squeeze: combobox contains default value and
"other..." option, clicking latter will bring up pop-up window with
long scrollable list of options and standard "ok", "cancel" buttons.

# Missing features

## Choose keyboard layout independently from the language

It's impossible to choose keyboard layout independently from the
language. Example use-case: X needs to get his GNOME UI in Italian,
because he happens to speak that language much better than English AND
faces an azerty keyboard (e.g. because he's traveling), also he does
not know touch-typing so the keyboard physical and logical layout have
to match.

## Locales should be generated in the background

Once a language is selected, while the user customizes other settings,
the locales should be generated. Login should be blocked (probably
with visual indication that something is going on) until locales
generation is finished.

It's not that simple to implement: t-g is executed as 'Debian-gdm' -
it can't run localedef to generate locale; we have to weight the risk
of sudo / suid vs. the user experience benefits.

## Appearance

# Fixed, testing required

## Admin credentials

If user have entered password than it should be asked to grant root
access, otherwise root access should be completely disabled. Testing:
"sudo ls" in terminal window should asks for the password and show the
content of the current directory. If user hasn't entered the password
in TailsGreeter than "sudo ls" should report error that user is not in
'sudoers' file. Similarly running "time-admin" utility and pressing
unlock button should allow user to alter time settings (for example -
add pool.ntp.org to the list of servers).

## Second login after user password was set

TailsGreeter uses hardcoded login and
password values. That's why on logout the password is reset back to default value to allow 2nd login even if user password was set during 1st one.

# Not a bug / unimportant

## Layout-testing in text box is broken

Was working in 0.1.0 but in 0.1.1~2.gbpad6da2, selecting French
keyboard layout => still QWERTY layout in layout-testing text box.

git bisect shows this was broken by commit 85ddb5c9. However, let's
spending any time on that would be futile: the layout-testing box was
a debugging-only tool, and won't be displayed to end users.

## Localization preserved on logout

If user chosen fr_FR locale, logged in, logged out, chosen ru_RU
locale then upon login all 3 locales (en_US, fr_FR, ru_RU) will be
available instead of expected 2.

> I'm not sure we really want to seriously support logout / login,
> mostly because it does not any kind of serious protection, so
> let's say this is not that much of a bug.
