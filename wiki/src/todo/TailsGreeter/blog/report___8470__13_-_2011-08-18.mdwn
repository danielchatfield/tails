## Problems

0. Glade seems pretty counter-intuitive: it's unclear how to make gtk window (parent) auto-resize when it's content (gtk entry inside gtk table) have expanded.
0. Proposed addition to add selection of any layout will require list which is even bigger than language list (which is currently considered unusable due to its size) - it's unclear how to do it right in UI. Addition is justified by following use-case example: Italian speaking person running TAILS on computer with Norwegian kb layout and would like to have Italian locale but Norwegian layout to match hardware at hands.
0. Hardcoded username and password prevent using tails-greeter 2nd time. Switch to gdm's autologin functionality is required.

## Next week plans

0. Document all the known issues. Create pages according to bug-reporting guideline.
0. Try to fix some of them.
0. Consume questionable substances - celebrate GSoC completion.
