## Current progress


0. fix errors reported by pylint - DONE (some errors still there).
0. bump version properly (git push --tags; git-dch --git-author) - DONE.

0. fix language selector so it's shown and work properly - DONE (.po translations are incomplete).

0. wiki updates (testing instructions and overall status) - DONE.
0. lintian tails-greeter.deb (using .changes file too) - DONE (no errors reported).
0. make login possible - IN_PROGRESS.
0. add .deb into tails repo - BLOCKED by previous item.
0. make .iso build (if packages testing-ready) - BLOCKED by previous item.

## Problems

BeginAutoLogin works as expected but interfacing with existing GdmGreeter to send it at the right moment seems trick.
Documentation complete absent so will have to talk directly with the developer about it.

## Near-future plans

0. relocation to another country
0. fixes\updates\minor items which were postponed for whatever reason
