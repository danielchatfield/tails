[[!meta title="Provide a migration path from TrueCrypt"]]

TrueCrypt is [[now included|todo/include_truecrypt]] in Tails, but with its
[license](http://www.happyassassin.net/2008/08/06/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-truecrypt/) and development practices, we would like to provide a migration
path from TrueCrypt.

We now need to research, implement and possibly document replacement
solutions.

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Next steps

0. decide what alternative we want to push users to (mainly boils
   down to cryptkeeper/encfs vs. LUKS) [[!tag todo/research]]
1. write the migration documentation [[!tag todo/documentation]]
2. ship TrueCrypt for releases N and N+1, announcing it will be
   removed in release N+2, and pointing to the migration doc. Writing
   a tiny wrapper around the TrueCrypt executable is probably needed
   to ensure this announce is displayed. (shell script + zenity looks
   like the adequate tools) [[!tag todo/code todo/easy]]
3. don't ship TrueCrypt in release N+2

# Use cases

## Encrypted USB stick

GNOME Disk Utility provides an easy way to encrypt storage media.

## Plausible deniability

## More?

TrueCrypt lovers should tell us why they would miss it. Then we can
decide if and how we want to support the described usecases.

# Resources

* [RealCrypt](http://rpmfusion.org/Package/realcrypt): one Fedora
  maintainer forked TrueCrypt and ships 3rd-party RPMs outside of
  Fedora.
