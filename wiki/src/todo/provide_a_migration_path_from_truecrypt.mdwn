[[!meta title="Provide a migration path from TrueCrypt"]]

TrueCrypt is [[now included|todo/include_truecrypt]] in Tails, but with its
[license](http://www.happyassassin.net/2008/08/06/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-truecrypt/) and development practices, we would like to provide a migration
path from TrueCrypt.

We now need to research, implement and possibly document replacement
solutions.

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Next steps

0. decide what alternative we want to push users to (mainly boils
   down to cryptkeeper/encfs and/or LUKS and/or `tc-play`)
   [[!tag todo/research]]
1. write the migration documentation [[!tag todo/documentation]]
2. ship TrueCrypt for releases N and N+1, announcing it will be
   removed in release N+2, and pointing to the migration doc. Writing
   a tiny wrapper around the TrueCrypt executable is probably needed
   to ensure this announce is displayed. (shell script + zenity looks
   like the adequate tools) [[!tag todo/code todo/easy]]
3. don't ship TrueCrypt in release N+2

# Use cases

## Encrypted USB stick

GNOME Disk Utility provides an easy way to encrypt storage media.
(Sure, but what about people who don't use GNOME? - see notes on interoperability below)

## Plausible deniability
Supported with TrueCrypt hidden containers - is there a Free alternative for this?

## File containers
This is a filesystem-in-a-file, which makes portability a breeze. It's easy to take your secrets with you on a USB stick, without having to prepare/sacrifice the entire USB stick. Ditto for any storage medium. Combine TrueCrypt file containers with an untrustworthy service like Dropbox and you have your secrets synced across computers with very little effort.

## Cross-platform support
A TrueCrypt file container can be used from any OS and any distro we happen to be using at the time.

## Consistent GUI
First of all, TrueCrypt has a GUI which exposes all functions a non-admin user needs.
Secondly, the GUI is consistent across operating systems. Master TrueCrypt on Windows, and you know how to use it on Linux, MacOSX etc.
Thirdly, the GUI has not significantly changed in years

## More?

TrueCrypt lovers should tell us why they would miss it. Then we can
decide if and how we want to support the described usecases.
