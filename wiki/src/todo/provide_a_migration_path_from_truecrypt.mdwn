[[!meta title="Provide a migration path from TrueCrypt"]]

TrueCrypt is [[now included|todo/include_truecrypt]] in Tails, but with its
[license](http://www.happyassassin.net/2008/08/06/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-truecrypt/) and development practices, we would like to provide a migration
path from TrueCrypt.

We now need to [[!taglink todo/research]], implement and possibly
document replacement solutions.

# Use cases

## Encrypted USB stick

GNOME Disk Utility provides an easy way to encrypt storage media.

## Plausible deniability

## More?

TrueCrypt lovers should tell us why they would miss it. Then we can
decide if and how we want to support the described usecases.

# Resources

* [RealCrypt](http://rpmfusion.org/Package/realcrypt): one Fedora
  maintainer forked TrueCrypt and ships 3rd-party RPMs outside of
  Fedora.
