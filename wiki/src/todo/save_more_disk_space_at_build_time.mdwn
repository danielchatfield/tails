[[!toc levels=2]]

The following can only be implemented once we [[switch to live-build
3.x|todo/live-build_3.x]]. So let's [[!taglink todo/wait]].

switch to live-build hooks
==========================

live-build 3.x ships a few interesting space-saving hooks in
`share/hooks`, such as one that removes GNOME icon cache, another one
that removes compiled Python `.pyc` files, and one that removes
`/tmp/*` at the end of the `chroot_local-hooks` stage.

Once we use this version of live-build, we can remove our own
implementation of this from `config/chroot_local-hooks/98-remove_unwanted_files`.

files only needed at build time
===============================

We're currently using `chroot_local-includes` as a way to pass files
from the build host to the build chroot. As a result, released images
contain many files (mostly in `/usr/`) that are needed at build time
but useless at runtime.

live-build 3.x bind mounts (read-only) the build configuration
directory (`config`) inside the chroot (onto `/root/config`) while the
chroot hooks are running.
