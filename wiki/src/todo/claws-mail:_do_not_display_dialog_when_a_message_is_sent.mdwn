Claws-mail should not display a popup dialog when a message is being sent (one cannot use claws anymore until the message is sent).

Adding `send_dialog_mode=1` to clawsrc seems to do the trick.

Let's test by changing this setting in
`~/.claws-mail/clawsrc` in a pristine Tails *before* running Claws.

>> Time to implement it, then.

>>> A patch was sent on tails-dev

[[!taglink pending]] for 0.20.
