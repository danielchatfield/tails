A complete TBB+Obfsproxy bundle is available from the project's
page. The default configuration file is set to connect via a selection
of preconfigured obfs2 bridges. It all just works<sup>tm</sup>. Is
shipping such a static list of bridges something we want to consider
for Tails? It completely contradicts the "Hiding Tor usage"
requirement, but such users could opt-out of using the static list and
instead have to input bridges manually, as is currently the case when
using [[bridge-mode|todo/bridge_support]].
