Rationale
=========

In addition to [[ship Vidalia instead of TorK]], we need to find and
install a great non-KDE virtual keyboard in order to stop installing
KDE libraries.

Previous research was unsuccessful, but things may have changed in
the meantime.

Initial research
================

This was moved to [[todo/virtual_keyboard_in_Debian]].

Implementation
==============

onBoard seems to be the nicest available solution.

Custom package
--------------

[[!tag todo/done]]

Have custom built packages included in amnesia:

1. rebuild `python-virtkey` packages for our supported architectures
   (no extra work needed), and drop the debs into
   `config/chroot-localpackages` **done**
2. adapt the onBoard source package for Lenny **done**
3. build an onBoard package (arch-independent) and drop it into
   `config/chroot-localpackages` **done**
4. publish the modifications we made to the Ubuntu source package **done**
   in the `deb-src/onboard` directory in Tails Git repository.
5. add an autostart file **done**
6. test! **done**
7. stop installing kvkbd **done**

Long-term goal: inclusion in Debian
-----------------------------------
