A few places in Tails (`git grep LANG`) assume everything that can be
in `$LANG` starts with the `xx_XX` form, which is, unfortunately, not
true: e.g. `fil_PH`.

Instead of relying home-made shell trickery and re-inventing the wheel
we should consider using some existing library or tool for this, or we
should read the standards so we can prevent buggy edge cases.
