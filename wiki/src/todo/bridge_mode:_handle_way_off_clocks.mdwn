Issue: Boot with bridge mode enabled and the system clock totally
off. Notice that Tor fails to connect to the Tor network. It get's
stuck in `is_clock_way_off()`'s `sleep 1` loop, at bootstrap progress
10%, which means `tor_cert_lifetime_invalid()` is returning false: the
SSL handshake just fails, without the grep'ed string being written to
the log.

That works well when bootstrapping directly against the directory
authorities, and the issue seems to be due to an inconsistency w.r.t
log severity. When using a bridge the strings we grep for in the log
have the (higher) "info" severity which we don't log by default,
compared to "notice" when no bridge is involved.

Solutions:

1. A very easy and very sub-optimal solution would be to have Tor log
   at the "info" level by default.

2. Like 1, but we only set "info" level debugging if in bridge mode,
   and revert it to "notice" when tordate finishes, via Tor's
   `ControlPort`.

   This has been implemented in the branch
   `bugfix/tordate_vs_bridge_mode`, candidate for the first post-0.15
   Tails release.

3. Another idea would be to (in `time-20.sh`) open a separate Tor log
   at the info level via the control port. Great care would have to be
   taken to make sure that the log is set up quickly after Tor starts,
   before there's *any* chance that Tor already has tried connecting
   to the bridge, so the string we grep for isn't "lost".
   
4. What about patching Tor to eliminate the log severity
   inconsistency? But perhaps they have good reasons for this being
   the way it is so it wouldn't get upstreamed?
