As reported in [[!debbug 610496]] and recently
[confirmed](http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2011/04/msg00074.html)
by a Debian kernel maintainer, the powerpc architecture lacks kexec
support.

Until this is fixed upstream, we should at least stop trying to run
the kexec sdmem process on this architecture.

> [[wishlist]], as [[powerpc support]] more generally.
