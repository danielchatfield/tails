Few clicks, few questions/answers => a working, configured, simple
Mail User Agent (MUA) with GnuPG support.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

* Heavy use of webmail software tends to be an awful user experience
  with Tor enabled.
* GnuPG integration into webmail software (with keys stored on the
  client) is not achieved yet, despite work being done to do so in
  RoundCube, SquirrelMail et al.; dedicated MUA software really
  perform better for this task
* firegpg+webmail is too annoying when receiving pgp-mime encrypted
  email

Implementation
==============

Which MUA?
----------

Thunderbird, as every Mozilla software, is a mess to configure
programmatically. It also may have a bit too many complicated
configuration options for the "one size fits all" solution
being seeked.

[Claws Mail](http://www.claws-mail.org/) seems quite easy to configure
programmatically; being lighter and simpler, it probably better fits
our mission. See the "Deploying Claws Mail" section of the [Claws Mail
User Manual](http://www.claws-mail.org/manual/claws-mail-manual.html)
for details about pre-seeding configuration so that the configuration
wizard asks only the few questions needed.

Early [[audit|applications_audit/claws_mail]] is quite positive, and
documents the prefs variables an easy configuration tool should set
for better privacy.

We now ship Claws Mail.

Miscellaneous ideas
-------------------

* Running the MUA should trigger a Tor identity change, so that one
  can quit'n'relaunch it without linking several identities.
* Preconfigured IMAP/SMTP/SSL server settings for various
  [[non-commercial ISPs|todo/better_support_of_non-commercial_ISPs/]],
  and a radiobox to select one; custom server setting must obviously
  be available as well.
