Few clicks, few questions/answers => a working, configured, simple
Mail User Agent (MUA) with GnuPG support.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

* Heavy use of webmail software tends to be an awful user experience
  with Tor enabled.
* GnuPG integration into webmail software (with keys stored on the
  client) is not achieved yet, despite work being done to do so in
  RoundCube, SquirrelMail et al.; dedicated MUA software really
  perform better for this task
* firegpg+webmail is too annoying when receiving pgp-mime encrypted
  email

Implementation
==============

Which MUA?
----------

Thunderbird, as every Mozilla software, is a mess to configure
programmatically. It also may have a bit too many complicated
configuration options for the "one size fits all" solution
being seeked.

[Claws Mail](http://www.claws-mail.org/) seems quite easy to configure
programmatically; being lighter and simpler, it probably better fits
our mission. See the "Deploying Claws Mail" section of the [Claws Mail
User Manual](http://www.claws-mail.org/manual/claws-mail-manual.html)
for details about pre-seeding configuration so that the configuration
wizard asks only the few questions needed.

Early [[audit|applications_audit/claws_mail]] is quite positive, and
documents the prefs variables an easy configuration tool should set
for better privacy.

We now ship Claws Mail.

Miscellaneous ideas
-------------------

* Running the MUA should trigger a Tor identity change, so that one
  can quit'n'relaunch it without linking several identities.
* Preconfigured IMAP/SMTP/SSL server settings for various
  [[non-commercial ISPs|todo/better_support_of_non-commercial_ISPs/]],
  and a radiobox to select one; custom server setting must obviously
  be available as well.

Next steps
==========

- decide upon [[todo/Return of Icedove?]]
- claws/GnuPG says the <amnesia@boum.org> GnuPG key is not fully
  trusted, when encrypting for it
- install CaCert's root SSL certificate in Claws Mail, to begin with,
  so as to be consistent with our Iceweasel configuration... until
  [[better_support_of_non-commercial_ISPs]] is implemented; we now
  install Claws Mail from backports.org, which is built against GnuTLS
  rather than OpenSSL, and should use th CA certificates provided by
  Debian, but an "unknown ssl certificate" error arises when trying to
  connect to a server whose certificate is signed by CaCert =>
