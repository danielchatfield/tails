Do we want to keep the CS Lite addon?

No other cookie manager is packaged in Debian yet.
If we want to keep it, we should package this one
or similar.

CS Lite features:

- blacklist cookies by default
- ability to whitelist domains at build time
- 2-clicks to whitelist a domain / website at runtime
