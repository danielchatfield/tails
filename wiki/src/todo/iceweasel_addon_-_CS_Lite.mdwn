Do we want to keep the CS Lite addon?

Also, [Cookie
Monster](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/4703/) seems much
better than CS Lite, aka. maintained and nicer UI; it's been uploaded
to Debian recently ([[!debbug 623970]]). Let's switch to it.

> Merged branch `feature/cookie-monster` into devel: installs Cookie
> Monster instead of CS Lite.

>> [[!taglink todo/done]] in 0.9.

If in the end we want to keep CS Lite, we should package this one or
similar. Someone filed an ITP for it: [[!debbug 636399]].


CS Lite features
================

- blacklist cookies by default
- ability to whitelist domains at build time
- 2-clicks to whitelist a domain / website at runtime

CS Lite issues
==============

Seems like it is unmaintained. We've had to edit its `install.rdf` to
make it work inside Squeeze's iceweasel.
