Creating or deleting a second partition using udisks resets the first partition's attributes.

Normal output is:

	$ sgdisk /dev/sdb --attributes=1:show
	1:2:1 (legacy BIOS bootable)
	1:60:1 (read-only)
	1:62:1 (hidden)
	1:63:1 (do not automount)

After creating a second partition, the output is empty.

As documented on the [syslinux
wiki](http://www.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php/Common_Problems#Missing_OS_.28gptmbr.bin.29),
trying to boot such a broken stick results in the `Missing OS` message
and no boot.

`tails-persistence-setup`, that creates the persistence partition,
workarounds this, but we must report this bug upstream.

This has been reported upstream as [Freedesktop
49524](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49524).

The bug actually lies in `parted`. It's been fixed in Debian Wheezy.
We now have to "[[!taglink todo/wait]]" for Tails to be based on Wheezy.
