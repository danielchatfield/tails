In his talk at LinuxCon Europe 2012 about random number generation on
Linux, H. Peter Anvin [strongly
advises](https://lwn.net/Articles/525459/) to run `rngd` (from
[[!debpkg rng-tools]]).

rngd acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number
generator) such as the ones in some Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets, and the
kernel's PRNG).

About haveged: "So, while I can't really recommend it, I can't not
recommend it either." If you are going to run HAVEGE, Peter strongly
recommended running it together with rngd, rather than as
a replacement for it.
