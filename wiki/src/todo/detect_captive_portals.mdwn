For users that haven't read the documentation about the unsafe browser
and/or just don't understand when it's necessary, it would be good if
Tails does a reasonable job to try to detect whether a captive portal
seems to be in place and notify the user if so. The approaches could
range from simplistic to more sophisticated:

* If `wait_for_tor_consensus()` fails during time syncing. Note that
  this would happen if Tails is booted on a LAN without Internet
  conneciton.
* Use [ooni-probe](https://gitweb.torproject.org/ooni-probe.git)?
* Other approaches.

The method used likely has to be active, but it should preferably hook
into some common, innocent looking network connection in order to
avoid fingerprinting.
