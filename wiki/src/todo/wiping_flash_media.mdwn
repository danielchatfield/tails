As [[pointed out in the
forum|/forum/Wiping_Flash_Media:_Problem_in_TAILS_Doc/]], former
versions of our [[documentation on secure
deletion|doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]], was wrongly
stating that *overwriting twice the available diskspace [on a USB or
solid-state drive] is usually, but not always, sufficient to securely
clean the drive.*

This basically says that in order to securely delete a file from a USB
you could delete the file and then the run "Wipe available diskspace"
even if you have other files on the volume. Which is wrong according to
the paper by [[Wei & al.|http://www.usenix.org/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf]].

We could propose to wipe the entire device and then reformat it.  But
`srm` doesn't seem to run on block devices: I get "Warning: /dev/sdc is
not a regular file, rename/unlink only!". On the other hand `shred`
seems to work as usual. It is included in Tails but doesn't have a
graphical interface.

So we cannot document a GUI procedure to truly wipe a USB stick at the
moment.

> The documentation was fixed in June.

Now that the plans for nautilus-wipe to be based on diskscrub are
abandoned, the most sensible way to fix this would probably be:

1. add an option to wipe with 3 random passes, rather than a mere zero
   one, to the [udisks Format
   method](http://udisks.freedesktop.org/docs/latest/gdbus-org.freedesktop.UDisks2.Block.html#gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-UDisks2-Block.Format)
2. add access to this feature from Palimpsest, which seems a more
   appropriate place to trigger destructive operations at the block
   device level than a Nautilus extension

**Next thing to do**: report this as wishlist tickets [[!taglink todo/upstream]].
