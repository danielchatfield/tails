As [[pointed out in the
forum|/forum/Wiping_Flash_Media:_Problem_in_TAILS_Doc/]], former
versions of our [[documentation on secure
deletion|doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]], was wrongly
stating that *overwriting twice the available diskspace [on a USB or
solid-state drive] is usually, but not always, sufficient to securely
clean the drive.*

This basically says that in order to securely delete a file from a USB
you could delete the file and then the run "Wipe available diskspace"
even if you have other files on the volume. Which is wrong according to
the paper by [[Wei & al.|http://www.usenix.org/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf]].

We could propose to wipe the entire device and then reformat it.  But
`srm` doesn't seem to run on block devices: I get "Warning: /dev/sdc is
not a regular file, rename/unlink only!". On the other hand `shred`
seems to work as usual. It is included in Tails but doesn't have a
graphical interface.

So we cannot document a GUI procedure to truly wipe a USB stick at the
moment.

The developer of nautilus-wipe is planning to switch from
secure-delete, which is not maintained anymore, to [diskscrub].
Fortunately, diskscrub knows how to wipe entire block devices, and
actually do advertise this as a safer option than wiping individual
files.

> The documentation was fixed in June.

We have to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for nautilus-wipe to be based on
diskscrub.
