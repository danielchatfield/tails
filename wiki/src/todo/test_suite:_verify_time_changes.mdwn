After setting the date to something wrong, one should verify that the
date change actually took place, else it makes little sense verifying
later that our stuff indeed has "fixed" the date: if we don't know for
sure that it was broken, we're not really verifying anything. This
should be implemented at least in
`features/step_definitions/time_syncing.rb`.
