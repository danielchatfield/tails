According to the [The State of the DNS and Tor Union (also: a DNS UDP
- >TCP shim)" thread](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Jul-2010/msg00007.html) on
or-talk:

> Many commercial Linux based routers like ActionTek and D-Link use
> dproxy-nexgen resolvers accessible at link-local 192.168.1.1. A
> reverse lookup of the gateway itself provides not just the internal
> address but also the public IP and hostname from ISP. there are
> other caching resolvers used in captive wifi portals and other
> locations with same behavior.

We then need to forbid queries to DNS resolvers on the LAN.
Exceptions: at least the htp user; more?

> This has been implemented, though untested, in devel branch (commit
> c2ad173) => [[!taglink todo/test]].
