Commit 6a2de87 sets `TOR_SOCKS_HOST` and `TOR_SOCKS_PORT` globally to
point to the SocksPort dedicated to Iceweasel. If some random piece of
software took these envvars into account, then it would partially
defeat our stream isolation design.

So, we should set these environment variables for Iceweasel only, e.g.
in the wrapper that we will probably create anyway for
[[todo/dont_autostart_iceweasel]].
