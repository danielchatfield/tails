Here is a feature request. Or a app request for Torchat to be included in the next release.

Tails is build up around Tor i see no reason not to include any usefull 3rd party apps that works with tor. Like torchat.Its small and only have a few dependencies. 

More about it here.
http://code.google.com/p/torchat/

If posible make a link for it in the menu.

# Implementation issues

In case we want to ship torchat at some point.


## dedicated Tor instance

torchat in Debian runs its own Tor instance.

Quoting its maintainer in Debian: "For torchat to use system's tor, it
will have to have write permissions on the system's Tor data
directory. Which I particularly didn't like, in comparisson to use
it's own tor instance. This is because it needs to store/read keys for
the hiddenservice to work."

## general unsafe feeling

Torchat was written by someone Tor people don't trust (yet) to write
secure software.

There was a thread on tor-talk about a confirmed attack in which
anyone could impersonate anyone to a Torchat user. The same author who
f***ed up the protocol completely the first time changed the protocol,
and after that I didn't hear of a confirmed impersonation attack, but
I also didn't hear anyone that I know has a clue say that it's safe to
use now.

The fact that torchat provides safe authentication was put in doubt by
a core Tor developer.
