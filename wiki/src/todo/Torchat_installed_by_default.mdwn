Here is a feature request. Or a app request for Torchat to be included in the next release.

Tails is build up around Tor i see no reason not to include any usefull 3rd party apps that works with tor. Like torchat.Its small and only have a few dependencies. 

More about it here.

If posible make a link for it in the menu.
