KeePass and KeepassX were suggested.

Now that [[doc/first_steps/persistence]] exists, shipping
a feature-full password manager may make sense.

A full password management system does a lot more than GNOME Keyring,
and has more sophisticated security features, e.g. copying masked
strings, auto-lock of the db, expiration notifications, etc.

A good password management system may be core to helping users "do the
right thing".
