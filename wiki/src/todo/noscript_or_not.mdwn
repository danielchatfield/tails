According to Karsten (thread "Quick question on Torbutton and
NoScript" on or-talk), it is a bad solution to use both plugins,
"which will do the same".

OTOH, the [Tor Browser Bundle](http://www.torproject.org/torbrowser/),
starting with its 1.0.0 version, ships the NoScript and BetterPrivacy
extensions. As [explained in details by Mike
Perry](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Mar-2010/msg00214.html),
they tweaked NoScript's configuration a lot; e.g. JavaScript is
enabled by default, but they make use of other NoScript
privacy features. See their [NoScript
configuration](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/torbrowser/trunk/build-scripts/config/noscriptconfig.json).
