We should install [OnionCat](http://www.cypherpunk.at/onioncat) in
Tails; it should probably not be an officially supported feature to
start with, but having it available would ease the development of the
[[todo/VoIP_support]] feature.

It will soon be in Debian (ITP: [[!debbug 626380]]), currently in
NEW queue.

First, more testing is needed to ensure OnionCat is needed for
whatever kind of [[todo/VoIP_support]] we end up choosing. Let's
[[!taglink todo/wait]] for that topic to mature a bit.
