We're going to have a dedicated Gitolite instance at immerda.ch so
that we can create repos and manage ACLs ourselves without delays, as
well as setup IRC commit notifications.

We're going to move all our repos there but the website.

# Resources

* the [documentation](https://wiki.immerda.ch/index.php/GitRepositoriesImmerda)
  about immerda's Gitolite setup
* core developers can clone the Gitolite admin repository from
  `tails@git.tails.boum.org:gitolite-admin.git`

# Roadmap

1. [[!tag todo/code]] move our repos currently hosted at immerda to
   the new setup.
   For each repository:
   * keep our mirrors at repo.or.cz? if yes, then they have to be
     pointed to the new upstream repositories.
   * update [[contribute/git]] accordingly
   * link to <https://www.immerda.ch/services/certs.html>
   * update [[shortcuts]] accordingly
   * have immerda delete the old repositories
   * send heads up to tails-dev so that everyone updates their config
1. move our repos currently hosted elsewhere to the new setup
