We're going to have a dedicated Gitolite instance at immerda.ch so
that we can create repos and manage ACLs ourselves without delays, as
well as setup IRC commit notifications.

We're going to move all our repos there but the website.

1. move (or have immerda move) our repos currently hosted at immerda
   to the new setup:
  * the [documentation](https://wiki.immerda.ch/index.php/GitRepositoriesImmerda)
    about immerda's Gitolite setup
  * core developers can clone the Gitolite admin repository from
    `tails@git.tails.boum.org:gitolite-admin.git`
1. move our repos currently hosted elsewhere to the new setup
1. [[setup IRC commit notifications|todo/find_another_irc_commit_bot]]
