Since Tails 0.11, we stopped shipping a [[hybrid
ISO|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]] because:

  * the new USB installer provides an alternative way to install Tails
    on USB sticks;
  * our Ã¼ber-weird hybrid ISO's (with recursive partition table and
    stuff) have been historically hard to boot on certain specific
    hardware, once burnt onto a CD

As a consequence, pre-UEFI Mac users who have no optical drive cannot
install Tails anymore, due to `isohybrid` being unavailable on their
system (UEFI Apple hardware apparently can't boot Tails anyway).

But actually, the Perl version (`isohybrid.pl`, still shipped as
`/usr/bin/isohybrid.pl` by `syslinux-common` in Wheezy) can probably
work on their system:

0. [[!taglink todo/test]] `isohybrid.pl` on Mac
0. if it works, write documentation to point these Mac users to this program
