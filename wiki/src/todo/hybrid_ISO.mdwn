Since Tails 0.11, we stopped shipping a [[hybrid
ISO|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]] because:

  * the new USB installer provides an alternative way to install Tails
    on USB sticks;
  * our über-weird hybrid ISO's (with recursive partition table and
    stuff) have been historically hard to boot on certain specific
    hardware, once burnt onto a CD

As a consequence, Mac users who have no optical drive cannot install
Tails anymore, due to `isohybrid` being unavailable on their system.

Perhaps we should ship hybrid ISO's again, possibly hybrid'd with the
default `isohybrid` operation mode, rather than in über-weird mode.
