Since Tails 0.11, we stopped shipping a [[hybrid
ISO|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]] because:

  * the new USB installer provides an alternative way to install Tails
    on USB sticks;
  * our Ã¼ber-weird hybrid ISO's (with recursive partition table and
    stuff) have been historically hard to boot on certain specific
    hardware, once burnt onto a CD

As a consequence, pre-UEFI Mac users who have no optical drive cannot
install Tails anymore, due to `isohybrid` being unavailable on their
system (UEFI Apple hardware apparently can't boot Tails anyway).

But actually, the Perl version (`isohybrid.pl`, still shipped as
`/usr/bin/isohybrid.pl` by `syslinux-common` in Wheezy) can probably
work on their system:

* [[!taglink todo/test]] `isohybrid.pl` on more Mac hardware
  - works on a Macbook Pro (model A1150)
* [[!taglink todo/research]] an easy way to install `isohybrid.pl` for
  Mac: is there a syslinux package/port?
* write [[!taglink todo/documentation]] to point these Mac users to
  this program; being worked on at
  <https://github.com/kolohe/amnesia/tree/manual_usb_installation/mac>
