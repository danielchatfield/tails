Since Tails 0.11, we stopped shipping a [[hybrid
ISO|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]] because:

  * the new USB installer provides an alternative way to install Tails
    on USB sticks;
  * our Ã¼ber-weird hybrid ISO's (with recursive partition table and
    stuff) have been historically hard to boot on certain specific
    hardware, once burnt onto a CD
