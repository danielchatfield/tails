Offer help obfuscating writing style.

I think this is one of the biggest issues and needs more focus.

Everybody has ever written one or another post in a clearnet blog comment, forum...

When we post over Tor we can still be traced because of our Writing Style. We tend to repeat the same phrases, mistakes and have our favorite vocabulary and so on. This can connect our clearnet identity with out anonymous identity.

There is Anonymouth but I don't understand it. I don't know if it's quite ready yet.

Please view this youtube video. Very interesting. I know it's long. There is not much information about this topic available and this video is a good start.

You can hide to some degree if you change your writing style. I doesn't help much! And the current detection techniques are just the beginning!
