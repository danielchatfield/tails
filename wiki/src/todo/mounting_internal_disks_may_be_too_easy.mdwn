Getting read-write access to internal hard-disk's partitions (e.g.
Windows ones)...

* until Tails 0.6.x (based on Debian Lenny): required running commands
  as root in a terminal
* in Tails 0.7 (based on Debian Squeeze): is two-clicks away in
  GNOME's *Places* menu, thanks (?) to udisks.

Shall we consider this is a Tails bug or a feature?

In case we consider this is a bug, ways to disable this behaviour
are:

* ad-hoc / short-term solution, via PolicyKit: the default
  policy shipped by udisks is in
  `/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.udisks.policy` and
  could be overridden in `/etc/polkit-1/`
* generic / long-term solution: implement [[todo/better_root_access_control]].
  That was [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.11. Mounting internal hard drive
  now ask for an administrative password, on behalf of
  `org.freedesktop.udisks.filesystem-mount-system-internal`.

What is left is to [[document_how_to_access_internal_disks]]. Long
term goal is to implement an [[opt-out read-only lock of internal hard
disks|better_internal_disks_lock]].

[[!tag todo/done]]
