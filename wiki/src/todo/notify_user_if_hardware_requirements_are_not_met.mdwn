Rationale: Tails 0.7.x is known to boot fine and "work" for hours for
basic web browsing on a computer with 512MB RAM. However, it hangs as
soon as too many tabs are open / applications are run. The recommended
amount of memory to seriously run Tails is therefore 1GB.

Tails should therefore notify the user when booting it on a computer
that does not meet the hardware recommandations. This notification
would be printed somewhere on the [[tails-greeter|todo/TailsGreeter]]
([[todo/boot_menu]]) screen.
