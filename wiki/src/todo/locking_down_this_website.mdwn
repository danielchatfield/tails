We have decided to lock-down this website a bit. This will be
authorized:

- anonymous random edits on [[bugs]], [[todo]] and [[forum]]
- translation of any page: a set of signed-in translators
- editing any part of the website: Tails core developers

`locked_pages` should become something like:

	(!lang(en) and (
	      !user(translator1)
	  and !user(translator2)
        ))
	or ! (bugs/* or todo/* or forum/*)

# Next things to do

* test this locally, then ask <root@boum.org> to apply it to our
  online wiki.
* document the new translation process on the
  [[contribute/how/translate]] page [[!tag todo/documentation]]

[[!tag todo/website todo/easy]]
