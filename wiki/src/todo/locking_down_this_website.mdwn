We have decided to lock-down this website a bit. This will be
authorized:

- anonymous random edits on [[bugs]], [[todo]] and [[forum]]
- editing any part of the website: Tails core developers

`locked_pages` should become something like:

	! (bugs/* or todo/* or forum/*)

# Next things to do

test this locally, then ask <root@boum.org> to apply it to our
online wiki.

[[!tag todo/done]]
