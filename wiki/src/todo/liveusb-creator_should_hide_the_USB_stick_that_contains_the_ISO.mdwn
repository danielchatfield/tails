Scenario:

0. Boot Tails from USB stick Alpha
0. Take another USB stick (Bravo), partition it using MBR scheme, make
   a partition with a FAT filesystem on it, drop a Tails ISO in there.
0. Plug USB stick Bravo into Tails started from stick Alpha.
0. Run the Tails USB Installer, choose "Upgrade from ISO"
0. Select as update source the ISO on stick Bravo.

Result: the partition (on Bravo) that contains the source ISO is
listed in the available destination partitions. The resulting stick
may not be bootable, and even if it is, it won't be supported by the
persistence setup / incremental update tools.

Solution: either hide the partition on Bravo from the possible
destination partitions list, or improve the heuristics to detect what
is a partition that contains a Tails system that can be updated (e.g.
using the GPT partition label).
