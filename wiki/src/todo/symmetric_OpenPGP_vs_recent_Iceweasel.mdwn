Rationale
=========

A great bunch of Tails users currently use symmetric OpenPGP
encryption in Iceweasel, thanks to FireGPG. We want to support this
usecase on the long run.

Also, we've been wanting to ship [[todo/Iceweasel_5.x]] as soon as
possible, but FireGPG [is discontinued
upstream](http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2010/06/07/firegpg-discontinued/)
and is known [not to work with
FF4+](http://blog.getfiregpg.org/2011/04/01/firegpg-and-firefox-4/)
"because of the missing IPC library".

We need to find a way to support symmetric OpenPGP encryption in
Tails.

Implementation ideas
====================

Port FireGPG to recent Firefox/Iceweasel releases
-------------------------------------------------

As of June 2011, the most active FireGPG fork is [darkpixel's
one](https://github.com/firegpg/firegpg). It recently merged
[bit's branch](https://github.com/bit/firegpg) in, that adds
support for Firefox 4. It's build system depends on:

* [ipccode](http://hg.mozilla.org/ipccode/): see `ipc/get.sh` in
  darkpixel's repository
* a local clone of the mozilla source code ([canonical
  repository](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/),
  [releases](https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/)).

Mike Cardwell's [easy installation
recipe](https://grepular.com/FireGPG_on_Firefox_5) works, but it uses
a binary IPC extension shipped in the Git repository.

We therefore need to build the IPC extension against the Iceweasel 5
source code and test the result. Note that a "simple" clone of the
Mercurial mozilla-release repository seems not enough as it lacks the
`obj-ff-release` directory. Is this directory generated when compiling
Firefox itself? [[!tag todo/test]]

The [Html Validator compilation
instructions](http://www.htmlpedia.org/wiki/FirefoxCompilation) have
stuff related to the mysterious `obj-ff-release`.


Find another user-interface that provides the missing feature
-------------------------------------------------------------

This could be a nice middle-term workaround.
We need to [[!taglink todo/research]] this.

### Local GUI

Writing a simplistic GUI able to symmetrically encrypt/decrypt text
should be quite quick.

### Local webapp

* Herbert Hanewinkel's OpenPGP Message Encryption in JavaScript:
 - [homepage](http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/)
 - only supports encryption
* gooxdoo JavaScript classes for OpenPGP encryption
 - [homepage](http://qooxdoo.org/contrib/project/crypto)
 - only supports encryption

Add symmetric encryption / decryption support to GNOME
------------------------------------------------------

This would be the perfect long-term solution, but we probably lack the
time and energy needed to implement it.

We asked the Seahorse authors to include this feature a while ago:

* [email asking it](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/seahorse-list/2008-February/msg00005.html)
* [bug report tracking it](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=325803)
