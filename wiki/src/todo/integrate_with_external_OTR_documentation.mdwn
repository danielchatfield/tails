- There is a decent documentation for OTR in [Security in-a-box: How to
  Use OTR to Initiate a Secure Messaging Session in
  Pidgin](https://securityinabox.org/en/pidgin_securechat).
- [[!taglink todo/research]] how we get external documentation translated
- Get the OTR upstream to link this documentation from their homepage.

> How about the documentation pages linked from the OTR GUI itself?
> IIRC they are pretty good too, and at least some are translated.
