All scenarios in `features/encryption.feature` failed on a slow system,
due to the "sleep" time between "clicking the gpgapplet icon" and
"sending a keypress that was supposed to be received by the gpgapplet
contextual menu" was too small.

This sleep time was bumped in commit 4eff913, but really, such code is too
racy:

    @screen.click("GpgAppletIconNormal.png")
    sleep 2
    @screen.type("k")

It would be good to implement something better, like... waiting for
the context menu to be displayed before sending the "k" keypress.
