All scenarios in `features/encryption.feature` fail for intrigeri: for
some reason "encrypt with passphrase" is selected even in the scenario
that's supposed to hit "k" to select "encrypt with pubkey".

It also seems that the "k" keypress is passed to the gedit window,
while it should go to the gpgapplet contextual menu.

Perhaps the following code (`step_definitions/encryption.rb`) is
a little bit too racy?

    @screen.click("GpgAppletIconNormal.png")
    sleep 0.5
    @screen.type("k")

On the short run, let's simply [[!taglink todo/test]] if a longer
sleep time would workaround this, but on the long run it would be good
to implement something better, like... waiting for the context menu to
be displayed before sending the "k" keypress. [[!tag todo/code]]
