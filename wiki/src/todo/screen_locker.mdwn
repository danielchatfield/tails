Now that it's possible to set a custom user password,
it probably makes sense to get GNOME Screensaver back
and allow users to lock their screen.

It should be able to set through the [[todo/better_power_off_button]]
and a session should automatically be locked (or just show the screen
saver if no password is set) after 5 minutes of idle.

# Implementation ideas

On the implementation side of things, care must be taken so that
a user cannot mistakenly click a "Lock the screen" button while
they have not chosen a password. Here's some ideas:

## Password-less amnesia account

Make the `amnesia` account password-less by default, and have the
"Lock screen" feature do something non-dumb in this situation. This
has been tested to work well; when no password is set, locking the
screen just starts the screensaver with no lock.

### Issues

However, making the `amnesia` account password-less overrides Tails
Greeter. TG can be seen for a split second when X starts and then
GNOME starts.

This seems to be PAM-related. It has been tried to disable
"nullok_secure" for pam_unix.so ("traditional password
authentication"), which means that empty passwords are ok when used on
secure tty's. That prevents gdm from skipping Tails Greeter and go
directly to GNOME, but then X aborts with PAM errors when clicking
"Login" in Tails Greeter. We should [[!taglink todo/research]] if
we can solve this with PAM in some nice way.

An alternative would be to not make the default user password-less by
default and instead have Tails Greeter do it in case an administrative
password isn't set. This would work as expected, and can easily be
simulated by setting a root password (using rootpw= on the kernel
cmdline) and switching out to a console and running `passwd -d
amnesia` right before clicking "Login" in Tails Greeter.

However, if X restarts after the amnesia user's password has been
deleted (so we didn't set an administrative password), we'd be back in
the same situation; Tails Greeter would be skipped, and any options
(e.g. locale) selected in it the previous time wouldn't be selected
this time. OTOH I suppose we assume X restarts won't happen, so it's
not a big issue.

## Only show the "Lock Screen" button when a password is set

Can be done with some `.xbel` thingie, e.g.
<http://superuser.com/questions/62124/how-to-remove-lock-screen-and-logout-from-the-gnome-main-menu-in-sled11>),
and disable gnome-screensaver's automatic post-timeout screen locking
(some trivial GConf setting)

# Other issues and things to do

* Also need to [[deactivate_screensaver_until_time_is_set]].

* When this is implemented we should add a "Lock Screen" action
  to the [[shutdown button|todo/better_power_off_button]].
