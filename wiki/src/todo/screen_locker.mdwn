Now that it's possible to set a custom user password,
it probably makes sense to get GNOME Screensaver back
and allow users to lock their screen.

It should be able to set through the [[todo/better_power_off_button]]
and a session should automatically be locked (or just show the screen
saver if no password is set) after 5 minutes of idle.

# Status

An initial implementation was started in the
`feature/better_power_off_button` Git branch, and reverted since it
turned out to be more complicated than originally thought.
This implementation and the problems listed bellow were discussed on
the tails-dev ML in November 2012.
