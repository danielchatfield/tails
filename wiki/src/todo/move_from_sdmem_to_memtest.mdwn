Rationale
=========

Replace sdmem with the Linux kernel's `memtest=2` feature will fix
[[bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]] and will generally be simpler
and more robust.

> Update: according to LibertÃ© Linux' Maxim Kammerer, the `memtest=`
> approach is flawed; it only tests LOWMEM, "so it seems that at most
> ~895 MiB can be tested in 32-bit x86 kernels". Therefore, it's
> currently not fit for any kind of anti-forensics memory wiping.
> Being discussed on tails-dev / reported upstream, end of 2011: [from sdmem to memtest, and testing procedures](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2011-December/000713.html), [PROBLEM: memtest tests only LOWMEM](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2011-December/000724.html). Max Kammerer opened [Linux bug 42630](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42630).

Plans
=====

Implemented in `bugfix/from_sdmem_to_memtest` branch.

Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for `feature/hugetlb_mem_wipe` to be
merged. If we're happy with it, we can avoid moving to memtest.
