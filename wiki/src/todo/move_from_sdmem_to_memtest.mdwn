Rationale
=========

Replace sdmem with the Linux kernel's `memtest=2` feature will fix
[[bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]] and will generally be simpler
and more robust.

> Update: according to LibertÃ© Linux' Maxim Kammerer, the `memtest=`
> approach is flawed; it only tests LOWMEM, "so it seems that at most
> ~895 MiB can be tested in 32-bit x86 kernels". Therefore, it's
> currently not fit for any kind of anti-forensics memory wiping.
> Being discussed on tails-dev / reported upstream, end of 2011.

> Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for the outcome of the discussion
> with upstream.
