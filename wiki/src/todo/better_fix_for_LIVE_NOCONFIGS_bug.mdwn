In 0.19~rc1, there's a regression: passwordless sudo is granted to the
`amnesia` user when no admin password was set.

This is due to `LIVE_NOCONFIGS`, we set in
`config/chroot_local-includes/etc/live/config.d/noroot.conf`, being
apparently ignored.

We're working this around (`bugfix/no_passwordless_sudo`) in ugly ways
for 0.19 final.

However, this should really be fixed [[!taglink todo/upstream]]:
[[!debbug 712232]].
