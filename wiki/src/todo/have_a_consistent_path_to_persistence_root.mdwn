Already two features of the persistence are pointing the user to the
root of the persistent volume ("Dotfiles" and "Additional software"). It
would be quite useful to have a uniform path to access this folder
instead of being dependent on the device name.

For example could there be a symbolic link to
/lib/live/mount/persistence/XXX_unlocked/ named
/lib/live/mount/persistence/root/?
