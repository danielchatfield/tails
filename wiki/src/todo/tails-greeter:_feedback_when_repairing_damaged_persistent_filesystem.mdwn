When one enables persistence with a persistent FS whose state is
inconsistent state, tails-greeter appears to hang, while it's actually
waiting for the fsck/recovery process to finish. Some people will
interpret this as a system crash, because it takes longer than normal.

On a 14GB test persistent volume, the recovery took more than
a minute. It continued booting fine after recovery.

Relevant kernel messages:

	kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
	EXT3-fs (dm-0): using internal journal
	EXT3-fs (dm-0): recovery complete
	EXT3-fs (dm-0): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode
