Sometimes, when running tails-persistence-setup ASAP after the GNOME
panel is ready, the volume creation fails with
`org.freedesktop.Udisks.Error.Busy: a job is pending on /dev/sdb2`.
The partition is created, the LUKS volume is initialized and left
unlocked, but no filesystem was apparently created.

This happens both in Tails 0.18 (Linux 3.2), and in a later
experimental build from commit ce392805c0 (Linux 3.8).

We could only reproduce this with a 16GB USB3 stick on a Thinkpad X32.
