Quoting the [Tor wiki Live CD best
practices](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/LiveCDBestPractices):

> OPTIONAL? To prevent the browser from keeping HTTP sessions open
> over existing circuits the following network settings should be
> applied. This will ensure that new circuits, such as requested via
> NEWNYM, will service subsequent HTTP requests.

They recommend:

	pref("network.http.keep-alive", false);
	pref("network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy", 0);
	pref("network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server", 0);

This may be desirable and is being discussed on tails-dev.
