Quoting the [Tor wiki Live CD best
practices](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/LiveCDBestPractices):

> OPTIONAL? To prevent the browser from keeping HTTP sessions open
> over existing circuits the following network settings should be
> applied. This will ensure that new circuits, such as requested via
> NEWNYM, will service subsequent HTTP requests.

They recommend:

	pref("network.http.keep-alive", false);
	pref("network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-proxy", 0);
	pref("network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server", 0);

This may be desirable and is being discussed on tails-dev.

> We decided we would not disable HTTP persistent connections, mainly
> because Torbutton currently has no "reset the browser state to a
> fresh one" feature => the only proper current way to get a fresh
> browser is to 1. Close iceweasel; 2. New identity; 3. Start
> iceweasel again => [[!taglink todo/done]]. Other ways to get a fresh
> browser / Tails session are being thought of.
