Free (as in Free Speech) Flash players now do a reasonably good job at
playing the simplest Flash files one can found online, i.e. movies.
Such software is listed and compared [[!debwiki Flash desc="on the
Debian wiki"]]. One of those should be shipped in Tails. Gnash seems
to be the most promising one as of Debian Squeeze, but it still does
not work on many sites and needs quite a powerful CPU for proper
rendering.

We have a dedicated ticket for YouTube ([[todo/easier_YouTube]]),
so this one is about... the rest.

Note that shipping a HTML5-ready browser did improve the situation
for YouTube, but not much for other video websites.

Next things to do:

[[!tag todo/test]]

* bring and organize some [[test reports from the
  forum|forum/Streaming_video_in_Tails]] into here
* [Video DownloadHelper](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/video-downloadhelper/) works pretty well
* test [Easy YouTube Video Downloader](http://www.yourvideofile.com/)
* JDownloader was suggested by an user
* test the tools that replace the Flash video with
  embedded WebM and/or display them with external player
  - [FlashVideoReplacer](http://www.webgapps.org/addons/flashvideoreplacer):
    as of april 2011, stable was broken and using beta was needed
* Greasemonkey + [Viewtube](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/87011)
  ([homepage](http://sebaro.co.cc/viewtube/?ln=en)) script
  - GPL, actively maintained, supports more than just YouTube
  - install `xul-ext-greasemonkey` package
  - set `greasemonkey.version` to an arbitrary large value in FF
    config
  - set `extensions.torbutton.no_tor_plugins` to false
  - should now test with the `totem-mozilla` package installed, which
    may not support the video formats broadcasted by YouTube, and
    might not be robust enough; `mozilla-plugin-vlc` (15MB compressed
    .deb files) might be safer bet.
* If we decide to go the Gnash way, we'll need to research the
  privacy/anonymity issues it may have.

BetterPrivacy
-------------

Does BetterPrivacy support Gnash / swfdec / whatever?

This is what's said about [BetterPrivacy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6623)
in the [Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#recommendedextensions):

> Better Privacy is an excellent extension that protects you from
  cookies used by Flash applications, which often persist forever and
  are not clearable via normal Firefox "Private Data" clearing. Flash
  and all other plugins are disabled by Torbutton by default, but if
  you are interested in privacy, you may want this extension to allow
  you to inspect and automatically clear your Flash cookies for your
  Non-Tor usage.


Discarded options
-----------------

`youtube-dl`, `clive` et al.: work pretty well, but not as
user-friendly as a UI integrated into the web browser.
`get-flash-videos` from sid works nicely in Tails; its `-p` option
plays the video in Totem. 400kB with dependencies. But... it is
command-line only. Might be better than nothing as a temporary
solution. Note that `cclive` is the one, in this category, that will
be nicely maintained in stable updates during the Wheezy lifetime.

[Youtube Moteado](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/75710): not
updated since mid-2010.

[Youtube without Flash Auto](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/50771)
([GitHub](https://github.com/Rob-ot/Youtube-Without-Flash)):
currently broken, looking for a maintainer
