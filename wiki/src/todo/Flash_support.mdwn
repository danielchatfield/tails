Free (as in Free Speech) Flash players now do a reasonably good job at
playing the simplest Flash files one can found online, i.e. movies.
Such software is listed and compared [[!debwiki Flash desc="on the
Debian wiki"]]. One of those should be shipped in Tails. Gnash seems
to be the most promising one as of Debian Squeeze, but it still does
not work on many sites.

Next things to do:

* [[!taglink todo/research]] how shipping a [[todo/html5 ready
  browser]] could be considered as a valid alternative;
* [[!taglink todo/research]] alternatives 
  - http://www.yourvideofile.com/
  - `youtube-dl`, `clive` et al.
* If we decide to go the Gnash way, we'll need to research the
  privacy/anonymity issues it may have.
