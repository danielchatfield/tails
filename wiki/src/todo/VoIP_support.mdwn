[[!taglink todo/research]] if VoIP can be usable in the context of Tails.

Preliminary testing showed
[OnionCat](http://www.cypherpunk.at/onioncat/) +
[Mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) to be a working and
relatively easy to setup Tor-enabled VoIP solution; the 1/2s - 1s
delay is only slightly annoying.

As it was pointed out in the ["Adding voip to torchat"
thread](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2010/msg00143.html) on
or-talk, OnionCat provides no bidirectional authentication: the caller
has (limited) certainty to be talking to the call receiver, but the
reverse is not true. So this shall be used in combination with zRTP or
similar.

Technologies
============

Encryption and authentication
-----------------------------

**Note**: these are relatively old notes that should be updated and
further researched.

On the UI side, something similar to Pidgin's OTR would be perfect.

### DTLS + SRTP

- IETF chose DTLS+SRTP over zRTP
- a PKI is needed to authenticate peers :/

### OTR

<http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/09/sip-communicators-summer-of-code.html>

### SRTP2 (SIPv4)

<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-kaplan-sip-four-oh-00.txt>

### zRTP

User-friendly peer authentication with a voice-based "short
authentication string". How strong is this?

Conferencing
------------

### RFC 4353

[[!rfc 4353]]: three-peers SIP conferencing, using one of them as a
central mixer.

### RFC 4575

[[!rfc 4575]]: N-peers SIP conference rooms, using one of the peers as
a central mixer. One can see who is saying what.

### Mixer-to-client Audio Level Indication

- [Latest IETF draft](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ivov-avt-slic-03)
as of 20110111.

A mechanism for RTP-level mixers in audio conferences to deliver
information about the audio level of the individual participants
=> helps detecting where bad noise comes from.

VoIP software
=============

**Note**: these are relatively old notes that should be updated and
further researched.

Ekiga
-----

- in Debian Squeeze
- supposed to support zRTP... some day:
 * [their TODO item](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335594)
 * [last
   update](http://mail.gnome.org/archives/ekiga-devel-list/2009-April/msg00036.html)
   as of 200904

Linphone
--------

- in Debian Squeeze
- supports IPv6
- zRTP support [was asked
  for](http://www.archivum.info/linphone-developers@nongnu.org/2009-01/00013/(Linphone-developers)-Integrating-zRTP-protocol-into-LINphone.html)

Mumble
------

- [homepage](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/), wikipedia: [[!wikipedia
  Mumble_(software)]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- primary engineering effort targeted at low-latency
- successfully tested in combination with OnionCat
- TLS and OCB-AES128; seems to depend on a PKI for peer authentication

SFLphone
--------

- [homepage](http://www.sflphone.org/) wikipedia: [[!wikipedia
  SFLphone]]
- in Debian Squeeze
- SIP
- Multiple audio conferencing
- TLS and zRTP

SIP Communicator
----------------

- [homepage](http://www.sip-communicator.org/),  wikipedia:
  [[!wikipedia SIP_Communicator]]
- LGPL, written in Java
- not in Debian Squeeze
- supports IPv6, SIP, XMPP
- supports zRTP for key negotiation, SRTP for voice encryption, and
  TLS for signaling encryption

Twinkle
-------

- [homepage](http://www.twinklephone.com/)
- in Debian Squeeze
- was included in Incognito
- supports SIP, zRTP et SRTP
- [[!taglink todo/research]]: IPv6 support?
- Qt application, but does not depend on KDE libs
