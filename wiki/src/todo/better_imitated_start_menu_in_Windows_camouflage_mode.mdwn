We need to make the launcher in Tails look like the "start menu" in
Windows( eg: <bit.ly/OrSHi5>). We should do this for Windows XP
camouflage, Windows Vista camouflage, and Windows 7 camouflage. We can
use <bit.ly/QGTNw> for Windows 7 camouflage, and we can use
<bit.ly/QfmNRj> for Windows Vista camouflage (Both of these themes
already include the Windows like "start menu", so the only thing we
would need to do is create a "start menu" for the Windows XP
camouflage).
