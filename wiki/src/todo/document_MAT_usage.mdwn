[[!meta title="Document MAT usage"]]

On [[doc/about/warning]], one can read:

> **Tails doesn't clear the metadata of your files for you**. Yet. Still it's
> in Tails' design goal to help you do that. For example, Tails already comes
> with [Exiv2](http://exiv2.org/), an image metadata manipulation tool.

Tails now ship with [MAT](https://mat.boum.org/). The documentatino miss how
to use it, and this warning should be updated.
