Convergence ([homepage](http://convergence.io/)) is "an agile,
distributed, and secure strategy for replacing Certificate
Authorities". It seems like we should ship it at some point, as not
all Tails users will learn how to deal with [[todo/Monkeysphere]].

[[!toc levels=2]]

Next things to do
=================

We have to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for a decision regarding which
candidate(s) we want to support for the [[todo/web_browser_profile_with_no_CA]].

Other reasons to wait
=====================

The Tor Browser Bundle developers are [waiting for an external
audit](http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.tor.user/20164) before
shipping it.

Convergence is still not in Debian (ITP: [[!debbug 640786]]).

Upstream [bug tracker](https://github.com/moxie0/Convergence/issues)
is a quite full of important bug reports right now. The [lack of any
SNI support](https://github.com/moxie0/Convergence/issues/28) is one
of those. Waiting for the software to mature a bit would seem sound.

Implementation
==============

Notaries
--------

What set of notaries should Tails use by default?

### Tor hidden services

At least one configured notary must be able to validate certificates
for web servers running behind Tor hidden services, i.e.
https://xxxxxxxxx.onion. Maybe better to ship a separate Iceweasel
profile dedicated to this kind of browsing, that would use
[[todo/Monkeysphere]] instead of Convergence.

Captive portals
---------------

When we'll implement [[support wifi hotspots with captive
portals|todo/add_support_for_free_wifi_hotspots]], the webbrowser
configuration dedicated to this task probably need to **not** use
Convergence, as the Convergence client would not be allowed to reach
the notaries.
