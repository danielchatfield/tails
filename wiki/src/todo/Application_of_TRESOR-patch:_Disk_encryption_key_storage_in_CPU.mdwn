It would be very cool to have this patch applied:

> 2. The patch was not updated since 2.6.36 and we'll soon want to

>    seems, well, risky to me.
> 3. Unless the user has a processor supporting AES-NI, the supported

>    recommend. For most Tails users, protecting against cold boot
>    attacks would be great, but not at the cost of using that key
