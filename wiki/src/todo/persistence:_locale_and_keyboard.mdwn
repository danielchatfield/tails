Shall we allow users to choose, once for all, their preferred language
and keyboard layout, in a way that their elected settings are saved in
the Tails *system* **cleartext** partition?

User story:

As a Norvegian-speaking Tails user:

1. I install Tails.
2. I enable persistence, and somehow toggle "Language and keyboard
   layout *cleartext* persistence" on.
3. I reboot Tails.
4. tails-greeter is displayed to me in Norvegian, with a Norvegian
   keyboard layout.
5. I may type my persistent volume passphrase using my preferred
   keyboard layout, without the need to tell Tails about it
   once again.

Remaining problems:

* The above described user story mixes *cleartext* and *encrypted*
  persistence in the same UI. This may be a problem. We are suggested
  to move the language/keyboard layout decision to the **Tails
  installation** time of the user experience. Sounds clever.
