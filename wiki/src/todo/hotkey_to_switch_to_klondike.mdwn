Add solitaire, vanilla clone identical in appearance to Windows standard.

Nobody finds it odd or suspicious that someone is playing klondike.

Would be handy to have a hotkey, something like meta+k to start or
switch to klondike.

# Which one?

Quick benchmarking for that:

- vgacardgames: didn't manage to start it. It asks for mouse
  configuration. I gave up quickly.
- aisleriot: GNOME, asks for 21,4 MB of additional disk space. It looks
  quite different from the Windows version. There seem to be a "Card
  theme" option but selecting it in the menu doesn't trigger anything.
  In Squeeze, it's part of the `gnome-games` package. In Wheezy, it has
  it's own package.
- pysolfc: asks for 19.7 MB of additional disk space. It comes with 100
  card games and I guess we could make it lighter somehow. The look is
  quite heavily customizable and I managed to make it look pretty much
  like the Windows version.
- kpat: asks for 14.1 MB of additional disk space. It can also be
  customize to look quite much like Windows and the full-screen version is
  nicer (centered).

# Next things to do

[[!tag todo/research]]

1. update packages sizes to have the .deb size, not installed size
1. decide which one to install
1. how to bind a key?
1. preload at startup?
