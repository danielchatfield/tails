Objectives
==========

The objective is to make it easier to navigate through the website by:

- Having more direct accesses to important parts of the website. For that we
  propose to have, on some items, two levels of navigation in the sidebar.

- Remapping the filesystem of the git to match better the website navigation.
  That would improve the display of the breadcrumbs and make it easier to know
  « where you are ».

Reorganization
==============

Abstract of what should go in each part:

- **Documentation**: static documentation on how to use Tails.
- **Contribute**: everything related to advertizing, auditing, improving or
  developping Tails.
- **Help & Support**: tools to help the users who require more interaction than
  just reading the documentation.

According to that, here are a few movements we propose for existing pages: 

- build → contribute/
- chat → support/ for #tails, contribute/ for #tails + #tails-dev
- customize → contribute/
- features → doc/
- forum → support/ + show it in the navigation
- found_a_problem → support/
- git → contribute/
- GnuPG_key → doc/
- license → doc/
- patch → contribute/
- stay_tuned → not linked anymore
- support/truecrypt → doc/
- support/virtualization → doc/
- support/walkthrough → doc/
- talk-dev → contribute/
- talk-users → support/
- trusting_tails_signing_key → doc/
- upgrade → doc/

To be deleted

- MaxGSoC → contribute/

Some others are still under discussion:

- bug_reporting.mdwn → contribute/?;support/?
- todo → contribute/tickets?; /?
- bugs
- whishlist
