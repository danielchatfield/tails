Objectives
==========

The objective is to make it easier to navigate through the website by:

- Having more direct accesses to important parts of the website. For that we
  propose to have, on some items, two levels of navigation in the sidebar.

- Remapping the filesystem of the git to match better the website navigation.
  That would improve the display of the breadcrumbs and make it easier to know
  « where you are ».

Reorganization
==============

Abstract of what should go in each part:

- **Documentation**: static documentation on how to use Tails.
- **Contribute**: everything related to advertizing, auditing, improving or
  developping Tails.
- **Help & Support**: tools to help the users who require more interaction than
  just reading the documentation.
