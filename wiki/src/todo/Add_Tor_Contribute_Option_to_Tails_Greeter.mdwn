Tails only uses the Tor Network as a user. No contribution to the network. Maybe it's about time giving something back?

Tor has been improved to handle short running bridges.

Please add to Tails Greeter be a bridge, be a middle relay, be a exit. Options need to be well explained.

This should encourage Tails users to contribute. Even if only 1% of all users be a bridge that is already Tails user base / 100 * 1 more bridges.

Some people still use Tails normally, some will add a bridge and some people may find it easy to contribute to Tor. Just burn to CD, put into old machine, boot and voila a new relay is online.

All complicating setting up bridges or relays can be easy by burning Tails to CD.

Can be even better. The exit node setup for example could already contain an extra option for reduced exit policy, option for webserver which explains Tor.
