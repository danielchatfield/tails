We need to only allow OTR protocol v2 and later, to circumvent the
protocol version negotiation attack described in [Finite-State
Security Analysis of OTR Version
2](http://www.jbonneau.com/OTR_analysis.pdf) ... until the protocol +
libotr themselves are fixed.

0. ask on otr-dev why the protocol hasn't been updated since the
   publication of the aforementioned paper, especially wrt. the
   protocol version attack
1. [[!taglink todo/research]] if one of the many diverging OTR /
   pidgin-otr branches has fixed it
2. if it's not the case, add an option to pidgin-otr to "fix" that issue
