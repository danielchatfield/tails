We need to only allow OTR protocol v2 and later, to circumvent the
protocol version negotiation attack described in [Finite-State
Security Analysis of OTR Version
2](http://www.jbonneau.com/OTR_analysis.pdf) ... until the protocol +
libotr themselves are fixed.

This is fixed in 4.0.0 beta 1:

	git clone  git://otr.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/otr/libotr     
	cd libotr
	git show 7ffba65fa42052795523924279bc94e7c80fb0f7 -- src/proto.h

libotr 4 has landed into Debian. We should backport it for Wheezy.

Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Tails to be based on Wheezy.
