I would like to see the inclusion of [ekeyd](http://www.entropykey.co.uk/download/) into Tails.  This would allow Tails to be used, in conjunction with [EntropyKey](http://www.entropykey.co.uk), as an off line host to generate strong cryptographically random gpg / ssh / e.t.c keys

> Implemented in `feature/ekeyd`, [[!taglink todo/done]] in 0.16.
