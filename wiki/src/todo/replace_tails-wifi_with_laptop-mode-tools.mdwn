laptop-mode-tools has been shipped for a while in Tails.

The same effect as our custom `tails-wifi` initscript can be achieved
by setting `CONTROL_WIRELESS_POWER_SAVING=1` in
`/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/wireless-power.conf`.

> This was implemented in Git branch
> `feature/replace_tails-wifi_with_laptop-mode-tools`, time to test.

>> Merged into devel.

[[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.11.
