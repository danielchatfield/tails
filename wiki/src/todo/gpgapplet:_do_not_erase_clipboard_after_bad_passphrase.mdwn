Initial bug report
==================

When decrypting a text encrypted using passphrase encryption with Tails
gpgApplet, if you enter a wrong passphrase you have to copy the text again
to try another passphrase. The encrypted text should be kept in the
clipboard even if the given passphrase is wrong.

Bug description
===============

Investigating this bug, I found that the issue is that gpgApplet recieves
"owner-change" signal on X clipboard, with an empty clipboard content each time
it is called. It used to update freshest clipboard as a consequence, thus not
accessing the encrypted data anymore.

1st fix
=======

In bugfix/gpgapplet_do_not_erase_clipboard now update the clipboard only if it
is not empty. This keeps the content of the CLIPBOARD clipboard. [[!tag pending]]

Left to do
==========

The X clipboard is still filled with empty data, replacing its old content. If
it was the X clipboard that contained the data to be decrypted, the initial bug
report would still apply.
