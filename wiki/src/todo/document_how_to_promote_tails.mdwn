[[!tag todo/documentation]]

We could work on a section dedicated to how Tails was/can be promoted. Maybe with
the following sub-sections:

- Spread the word to potential users
- Promotion toolkit: CD jackets, leaflets, etc. (I've already felt
  the need for a small leaflet, e.g. double-sided A5, that would
  give a few hints to explain to a non-technical audience why tools
  such as Tails are needed, summarize how Tails can help solving
  issues, and point to our website for installation / usage
  documentation)

This section could be a first-level one ([[/promote]]) and be linked
from:

- [[contribute/how/promote]]
- homepage

A `todo/promote` tag was created.
