Although very rare, the remote shell can get into a state where it
stops responding, resulting in the test suite waiting for a response
forever. The reason for this has proved hard to determine, but it
seems to basically only happen for the very first interaction with it,
i.e. when running `VM.wait_until_remote_shell_is_up()`.

I think it has to do with the fact that its transport is TCP on the
host bridged to a serial device on the guest (see `<serial
type='tcp'>` in Libvirt domain XML format). Perhaps the TCP state vs
the guest's serial port's state gets out-of-sync if the TCP packet
times out before the serial port is up and running?
