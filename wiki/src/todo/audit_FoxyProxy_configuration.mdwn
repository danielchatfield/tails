However, security issues should not be ruled out. It remains to
investigate whether the current (devel branch as of 2010-10-12) setup
allows any attacks. Some possible attack vectors and other things to
meditate upon are:

* how does the "exclude localhost,127.0.0.1 from proxying" part of
  Torbutton work together with FoxyProxy?

 - Seems to work, at least the filter for reaching the I2P router
   console on localhost:7657 is working.

* are there any *good* corellation/fingerprinting/$other attacks that
  rely on html pages that refer to elements that will be fetched both
  through Tor and I2P?

 - One possible attack of this kind depends on that there's some sort
   of nefarious bug/"feature" in I2P which makes the I2P client
   connect to some arbitrary host on the Internet. An attacker
   controlling the target webserver (or running the Tor exit used in
   the case of a non-authenticated connection) could exploit that bug
   to make the I2P client connect *directly* to some host under the
   attacker's control. Of course, this is a bug of apocalyptic
   proportions in I2P, but the point is that bugs in I2P might very
   well open up for attacks on Torified connections with this
   FoxyProxy setup.

* are the regexps for the whitelist filters correct? can some urls
  escape their intended whitelist filter and be catched by another
  one, possibly making it unreachable?

* do non-ascii urls pose any problems for the regexps?
