Tails Greeter has a pt_BR.po file, and the .deb installs
`/usr/share/locale/pt_BR/LC_MESSAGES/tails-greeter.mo`, but the
interface doesn't get translated into Brazilian Portuguese when
Portuguese / Brazil is selected.

This bug is present at least on Tails 0.17.1, Tails 0.17, Tails 0.16.

Let's first [[!taglink todo/test]] if another translation for a locale
that's not the default one for its language (e.g. `fr_BE` or `de_AT`)
is applied.

If it is, then the problem is specific to the `pt_BR` translation.

Else, then the problem is a general one related to how a locale change
in the UI reflects to the UI language. FWIW, the call chain, from the
signal triggered by the UI change, to the window being translated on
the fly, should be: `locale_selected` -> `set_locale` ->
`self.__apply_locale()` ->
`self._greeter.SelectLanguage(self._locale)` -> `translate_to`.
