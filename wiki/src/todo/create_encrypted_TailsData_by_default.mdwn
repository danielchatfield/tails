# Rationale

The "Warnings about persistence" page states "The persistent volume is 
not hidden. An attacker in possession of the USB stick can know that there is 
a persistent volume on it."

If every Tails USB stick had a persistent volume 
automatically created (with a random passphrase not known to the user), there 
would be no way to tell that the user had set up a persistent volume rather 
than just leaving the automatically created one in place. This would mean that 
a user who had created a persistent volume could plausibly claim that he/she 
hadn't.

Of course, this wouldn't protect against being tricked, and will be of at best 
variable efficiency against 'rubber-hose cryptanalysis', but it would be useful 
in a country like the UK where a court can compel you, on penalty of 
imprisonment, to reveal cryptographic keys and passphrases if it can prove 
that you know them.

# Implementation

Implies modifying `liveusb-creator` and `tails-persistence-setup`.
