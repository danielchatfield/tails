It would be useful to have a persistence preset for configured printers.

Research
========

Symlinking `printers.conf` with the `link` option (and the `ppd` directory) doesn't work as cups moves its conffile to `printers.conf.0` and creates a new one.

Render `/etc/cups` persistent seems to be the way to go.

It might be necessary to restart cups after the persistence is setup.

Nexts setps to [[!taglink todo/research]]:
- test if squeeze `cupsd.conf` and other conffiles works with wheezy
- research potental leaks of informations to the persistent storage when making `/etc/cups` persistent (e.g. what about `subscriptions.conf`)
