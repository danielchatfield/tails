   * correctly adds `&html5=1` to YouTube urls

     0.17.2's browser)

Test reports
============

ViewTube Greasemonkey userscript
--------------------------------

With Tails 0.18, I first ran `apt-get install xul-ext-greasemonkey`,
that installed the version 0.8.20100408.6-1. Iceweasel said that this
extension is not compatible with iceweasel 17.0.6.

So `apt-get remove --purge xul-ext-greasemonkey`

Then from iceweasel, I installed both 
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/> (1.8)
and <https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/87011> (version 2013.05.21)

The page <http://isebaro.com/contact/?ln=en&sb=viewtube> reads "Videos
don't play on secure URLs (HTTPS)", but even with HTTPSEverywhere and
Noscript desactivated, the video quoted in the Test repot #1 is not
working: "The video should be loading. If it doesn't load, make sure
a video plugin is installed."

It's however possible to download the video, by clicking on "Get" in
the top-right corner of the video.

Left to test:

* Try installing xul-ext-greasemonkey 0.9.20-1 from unstable
* Check if there is an answer there
  <http://isebaro.com/contact/?ln=en&sb=viewtube#reply536>
* Checkout the last news at <http://www.greasespot.net/> and
