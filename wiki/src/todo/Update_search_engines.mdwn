This could be duckduckgo or ixquick, actually there should be startpage but I think TBB is going for changes about search engines: <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4902> So the search engine options in Torbutton would be useless. But for now please set it as DDG or ixquick

  Different from Iceweasel, the icons in Firefox are integrated into
  the xml files, so replacing them with Firefox defaults would
  be better.

*default-duplicate DuckDuckGo will be deleted in [[0.11|Update_DuckDuckGo]]
