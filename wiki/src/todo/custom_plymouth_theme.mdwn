In `feature/tails-plymouth-theme` branch we use a custom plymouth theme
that looks close to windows vista bootup. So I consier "The Tails boot
splash screen should be black with a tiny dots-based progress bar" as
pending. It however is working only on machines with KMS-enabled
graphics drivers. On other machines it falls back to the old text
plugin. This was shipped in 0.12, proved to break the boot on far too
many kinds of hardware, reverted in 0.12.1.

We should:

1. Reintroduce this in `experimental`, *without* enabling
   KMS on more hardware this time. [[!taglink todo/code]]
   - basically done in `feature/tails-plymouth-theme`
   - we also need to install [[!debpkg plymouth-drm]]
     1. either built from our custom `0.8.3-20~bpo60+1` backported
        source package, that's worth trying first
     2. or from Wheezy's source package (on top of it, we probably
        want to cherry-pick fixes for [[!debbug 691598]],
        [[!debbug 683764]], [[!debbug 691794]], [[!debbug 695706]]
        and [[!debbug 683763]]) [like Progress Linux
        does](http://sources.progress-linux.org/gitweb/?p=releases/baureo/packages/plymouth.git;a=summary)
1. Test it on various hardware for a while.

(This was part of implementing [[todo/windows_theme]]).
