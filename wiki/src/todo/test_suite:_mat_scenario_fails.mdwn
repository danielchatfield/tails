The `MAT can clean a PDF file` scenario fails, presumably due to some
race condition that might simply be avoided if moved to a dedicated
feature:

    Scenario: MAT can clean a PDF file                                     # features/checks.feature:45
    Given a computer                                                     # features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:63
    And the network is unplugged                                         # features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:107
    And I setup a filesystem share containing a sample PDF               # features/step_definitions/checks.rb:111
    And I start the computer                                             # features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:125
