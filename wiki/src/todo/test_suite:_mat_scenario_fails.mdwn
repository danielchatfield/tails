The `MAT can clean a PDF file` scenario fails, presumably due to some
race condition that might simply be avoided if moved to a dedicated
feature:

    And I setup a filesystem share containing a sample PDF               # features/cucumber/misc_tests/step_definitions/checks.rb:103
    And I start the computer                                             # features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:120
      Call to virDomainCreateWithFlags failed: Unable to read from monitor: Connection reset by peer (Libvirt::Error)
      ./features/cucumber/support/helpers/vm_helper.rb:359:in `start'
      ./features/cucumber/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:124:in `(root)':in `/^I start the computer$/'
