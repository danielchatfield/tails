The `MAT can clean a PDF file` scenario fails:

    Scenario: MAT can clean a PDF file                                     # features/checks.feature:45
    Given a computer                                                     # features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:63
    And the network is unplugged                                         # features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:107
    And I setup a filesystem share containing a sample PDF               # features/step_definitions/checks.rb:111
    And I start the computer                                             # features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:125
      Call to virDomainCreateWithFlags failed: Unable to read from monitor: Connection reset by peer (Libvirt::Error)
      ./features/support/helpers/vm_helper.rb:355:in `start'
      ./features/step_definitions/common_steps.rb:129:in `(root)':in `/^I start the computer$/'
      features/checks.feature:49:in `And I start the computer'

We initially thought it would simply be fixed if moved to a dedicated
feature, but testing shows that it's not the case.

Removing the `I setup a filesystem share containing a sample PDF` step
makes the next few initialization steps work, but obviously it also
breaks the only actually interesting test that follows.
