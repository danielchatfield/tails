Non-commercial, ethical ISPs, such as the one who signed the
[data retention manifest](http://www.nadir.org/nadir/aktuell/2008/10/10/36282.html),
need to be better supported by Tails.

Our plans
=========

[[!tag todo/code]]

1. Install the SSL certificates/CA for such servers (on the long run,
   we want them to use [[todo/Monkeysphere]] but we're not there yet).
2. Add bookmarks to the above-mentioned servers, in particular for
   quick'n'easy webmail access.

Implementation
==============

SSL certificates
----------------

### Iceweasel

The necessary NSS `*.db` files are:

* `cert8.db`: can be generated from scratch by adding our custom
  SSL CA and server certificates with `certutil`
* `secmod.db`: if this file is missing, a new one is generated without
  DSA, SHA256 and SHA512; weird.
* `key3.db`: if missing, the other `*.db` files can't be used.
