[documentation](http://grml.org/grml-live/#lzma-vs-zlib), LZMA
compression of the squashfs lowers the generated images' size by more
than 10%.

> Seems rather complicated to use, as the LZMA support for squashfs
> still hasn't reach the mainline Linux kernel 2.6.35, and we probably

>> Update: Squashfs LZMA support is now in mainline (2.6.38-rcX) in
>> the guise of Squashfs XZ - XZ is LZMA2 which is the successor to
>> LZMA.
