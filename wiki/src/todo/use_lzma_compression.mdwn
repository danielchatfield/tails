As highlighted by grml's
[documentation](http://grml.org/grml-live/#lzma-vs-zlib), LZMA
compression of the squashfs lowers the generated images' size by more
than 10%.

[[!toc levels=1]]

Current status
==============

This was implemented in the `feature/lzma` Git branch and was merged
into the `devel` branch => [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.8.

* Linux kernel: Squashfs LZMA support is now in mainline (2.6.38-rcX)
  in the guise of Squashfs XZ - XZ is LZMA2 which is the successor to
  LZMA. Current Debian unstable kernels (2.6.39 and later) support it.
* Userspace tools: `squashfs-tools` 4.2 adds support for XZ
  compression. It is available in squeeze-backports.
* Debian Live: exporting `MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS='-comp xz'` into the
  build environment (in `auto/build`) works.
* The [[contribute/build]] documentation now explains how to opt-out from XZ
  compression.

Test results
============

Results listed bellow are the resulting ISO images size.

20110423 - devel branch
