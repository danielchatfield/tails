As highlighted by grml's
[documentation](http://grml.org/grml-live/#lzma-vs-zlib), LZMA
compression of the squashfs lowers the generated images' size by more
than 10%.

* Linux kernel: Squashfs LZMA support is now in mainline (2.6.38-rcX)
  in the guise of Squashfs XZ - XZ is LZMA2 which is the successor to
  LZMA.
* Userspace tools: `squashfs-tools` 4.2 adds support for XZ
  compression. It has been uploaded into sid => we can have it fetched
  from there using APT pinning during the build process; a backport
  would be better, though.
* Debian Live: exporting `MKSQUASHFS_OPTIONS=--compression-type=xz`
  into the build environment seems enough; on the other hand, this
  might be the default in `squashfs-tools` 4.2; is it? [[!taglink
  todo/research]].

=> Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for 2.6.38 kernel to reach
squeeze-backports.
