For various reasons, we want to ship Iceweasel 5.x or newer in Tails.

Our `feature/ff4` Git branch installs Iceweasel 5.x from the Debian
Mozilla team's APT repository.

Next things to do
=================

[[!tag todo/wait todo/code]]

Some of our extensions are not marked as compatible with FF5:

- FoxyProxy: sid's 2.22.6-1 is compatible with FF4, but not marked as
  compatible with FF5; tracked by [[!debbug 634071]]
- Monkeysphere 0.6 is not marked as compatible with FF5; it mostly
  works with FF5, though, as we [reported to
  upstream](https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/3314) and to Debian
  ([[!debbugs 638585]])

Some other extensions are in a much worse state wrt. FF4+:

- CS Lite 1.4: unmaintained, not compatible with FF4+, needs to be
  upgraded or replaced, see [[todo/iceweasel_addon_-_CS_Lite]]
- FireGPG presumably does not work in FF4+; work [[is being
  done|todo/symmetric_OpenPGP_vs_recent_Iceweasel]] to find a solution.
