For whatever reason our firewall seems to not block all IPv6 packets,
like it should. For instance, Tails leaks link-local multicast
(ff02::1/64). We should [[!taglink todo/research]] if there are other
culprits.

For now a simple solution to block this leak would be to disable
IPv6 altoghether, i.e. by putting:

    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

in `/etc/sysctl.conf`.
