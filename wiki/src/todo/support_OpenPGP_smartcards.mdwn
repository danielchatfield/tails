Plans
=====

Next things to do
-----------------

1. how to support hardware despite the Seahorse bug ([[!gnomebug 530439]]):
   - Let's [[!taglink todo/wait]] for a decision regarding
     [[Seahorse vs. regular GnuPG agent|todo/regular_GnuPG_agent]].
   - else, is it an option to only document the
     `GPG_AGENT_INFO=` workaround?

Done
----

1. Get recent ccid / pcscd into Tails (it helps supporting some
   devices, see bellow) -- this is feature/OpenPGP-SmartCard:
   **done** (merged into devel, pending for Tails 0.15)
1. Publish a test ISO -- this should be 0.15~rc1 **done**
1. test with supposedly-fixed hardware

Tests
=====

## Test 0

I tested an OpenPGP smart card reader and card.
It turned out that it worked for me on Tails 0.13~rc1
without any additional package installed *but* only when executing gnupg as
root. It seems there is a permission issue, as discussed on tails-dev (see
below).

This is despite the fact that the `amnesia` user actually has proper
access (despite the ACL set thanks to
`/lib/udev/rules.d/60-gnupg.rules`, that is shipped by [[!debpkg
gnupg]]) to the USB device:

    $ lsusb | grep SCM
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 04e6:5115 SCM Microsystems, Inc. SCR335 SmartCard Reader
    $ getfacl -a /dev/bus/usb/002/004
    # file: dev/bus/usb/002/004
    # owner: root
    # group: root
    user::rw-
    user:amnesia:rw-

It looks like the problem is related to Seahorse: commenting `use-agent` in
`~/gnupg/gpg.conf` will enable GnuPG to use the card without extra permissions.
One can also call the following:

    GPG_AGENT_INFO= gpg --card-status

This is tracked as <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=530439>, no
progress since 2008.

Tester: <alan@boum.org>

Hardware: USB 04e6:5115 SCM Microsystems, Inc. SCR335 SmartCard Reader

## Test 1

### hardware

[gemalto USB shell token v2](http://shop.kernelconcepts.de/product_info.php?products_id=119)

	$ lsusb | grep GemPC
	Bus 005 Device 003: ID 08e6:3438 Gemplus GemPC Key SmartCard Reader

	$ getfacl -a /dev/bus/usb/005/003
	getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
	# file: dev/bus/usb/005/003
	# owner: root
	# group: root
	user::rw-
	group::rw-
	other::r--

	gpg --card-status:
	  gpg: detected reader `Gemalto GemPC Key 00 00'
	  Application ID ...: D2760001240102000005000014DA0000
	  Version ..........: 2.0
	  Manufacturer .....: ZeitControl

That reader does not get any ACL set by either the GnuPG ruleset, nor
by the libccid one.

All needed software is now shipped in Tails 0.15-rc1.

### tests

> The user credentials issues are discussed on tails-dev:
> <CALSDXiB1VWcEQ-BxJzXF95_mPg_UyHL6b83wXCGQz-a2hMvAYA@mail.gmail.com>

#### with pcscd installed

* can't use the card as a non-root user
* can use the card as a non-root user who is a member of the `pcscd` group
* can use the card as root

#### without pcscd, without gnupg-pkcs11-scd

* can't use the card as a non-root user
* can't use the card as a non-root user who is a member of the
  `pcscd` group; this hangs and must be killed by hand:

	$ gpg --card-status
	gpg: detected reader `Gemalto USB Shell Token V2 00 00'

* can't use the card as root

#### gpg2

* non-root user:

	$ gpg2 --card-status
	gpg: OpenPGP card not available: No SmartCard daemon

* root user:

	$ sudo gpg2 --card-status
	[sudo] password for amnesia:
	can't connect to `/root/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent': No such file or directory
	gpg-agent[8175]: can't connect server: `ERR 67109133 can't exec
	`/usr/bin/scdaemon': No such file or directory'
	gpg-agent[8175]: can't connect to the SCdaemon: IPC connect call failed
	gpg: OpenPGP card not available: No SmartCard daemon

#### without pcscd, with gnupg-pkcs11-scd

adding a line containing:

`scdaemon-program /usr/bin/gnupg-pkcs11-scd`  to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`

=> does not help, but perhaps it was not setup correctly.

## Test 3

On Debian Wheezy, using `systemd`, same hardware as Patrick Bx's
(Gemalto USB shell token v2).

Works:

	# apt-get install pcscd scdaemon
	$ GPG_AGENT_INFO= gpg --card-status

`pcscd` is [automatically started thanks to socket-based
activation](http://ludovicrousseau.blogspot.com/2011/11/pcscd-auto-start-using-systemd.html),
and exits after a bit of idle time.

## Test 4

On Tails 0.15, same hardware as Patrick Bx's
(Gemalto USB shell token v2).

Works:

	$ GPG_AGENT_INFO= gpg --card-status

Does not work:

	$ gpg --card-status
	gpg: selecting openpgp failed: unknown command
	gpg: OpenPGP card not available: general error

So, apparently the only blocking issue is the Seahorse bug.

  commit f29ce64272 in their Git. Their reason for disabling CCID over
  libusb ("supporting direct CCID interface via libusb makes no sense,
  since the devices are accessible only to "pcscd" daemon") may not
  apply in the Debian and Tails case, since the packages take care to
  give access to devices to the `amnesia` user, using an ACL.
