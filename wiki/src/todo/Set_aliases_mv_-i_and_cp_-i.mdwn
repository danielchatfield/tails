Please set the following typical aliases in tail's user shell:

alias mv="mv -i"

and also possibly

alias cp="cp -i"

The first is very important. I've already had one disaster on the commandline with mv because, unlike my other systems where this alias is set (many systems ship with it), on tails mv just overwrites without prompting!

> Great suggestion, maybe even set up an alias with a popup that would say: “It seems that you are trying to move a file. This is dangerous! Are you sure?” I think that the popup could also use a clipper icon.
