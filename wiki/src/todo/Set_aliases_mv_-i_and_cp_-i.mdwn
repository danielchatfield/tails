Please set the following typical aliases in tail's user shell:

alias mv="mv -i"

and also possibly

alias cp="cp -i"

The first is very important. I've already had one disaster on the commandline with mv because, unlike my other systems where this alias is set (many systems ship with it), on tails mv just overwrites without prompting!

> Great suggestion, maybe even set up an alias with a popup that would say: “It seems that you are trying to move a file. This is dangerous! Are you sure?” I think that the popup could also use a clipper icon.

> Aiee! Please don't do this. The fact that other systems have done this is not a reason to propagate that mistake. And it is a mistake, partly because it encourages users to develop dangerous, file-losing habits. I've been living in the UNIX shell for 30 years, without aliases, and I don't lose files... not because I'm special, but because I've developed ways of working that prevent it, even when non-standard, non-POSIX aliases that can't be relied upon are not in place. Of course, the other reason it's a mistake is that it's simply a nuisance... renaming and deleting files is a constant thing, and you shouldn't have to confirm it.
