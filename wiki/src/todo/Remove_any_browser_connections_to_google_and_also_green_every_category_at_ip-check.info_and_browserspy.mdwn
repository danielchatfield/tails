hi, would be great if you can completely cut away any connections to
google.com(maybe you already do?)

but i know in Firefox there are
several default settings inc. something like "safebrowsing" that sends
data to google.

Also, there are several categories at ip-check.info that TAILS is red
on that can be easily fixed with about:config settings(notably "FONTS"
but i think a few others are orange that could be GREEN. maybe there's
a reason that you have setup this way though?

also, is it possible for us to import a user.js file? i don't see any
way to access the IceWeasel profile thru the Places menu but i'm kind
of a noob in linux.

Also, cookie handling is kind of weak imo...on firefox i have it setup
to block all cookies and then i can just whitelist where necessary
with the add-on "cookie Whitelist, with buttons"...maybe its not as
necessary with your system though? idk.

thanks for listening.
