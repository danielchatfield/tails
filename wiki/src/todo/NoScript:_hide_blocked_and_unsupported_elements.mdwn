Quoting Andrew Lewman first-time users feedback:

> # Sixth issue: no flash, no warning

> 2 of 8 people had flash apps on their website. 4 of 8 had ad banners

> After an explanation, one person suggested changing the red outline

> 'this app blocked for your protection. click here to unblock it.'
> I explained why that wouldn't work (because there is no flash, java,
> silverlight plugins installed) and their answer was 'then do not

> It seems if the user cannot do anything about the blocked apps, not
