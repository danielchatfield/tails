The [[security/IP_address_leak_with_icedove]] can be fixed by setting
mail.smtpserver.default.hello_argument to "localhost". See [this Tor
wiki
entry](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO/EMail#ExperimentalSuggestionsforpossiblymakingthunderbirdandorclawsstopleakinginfoExperimental)
for other goodies. By applying those configurations I think both claws
and icedove comes to an equal level security-wise.

The question is, though, why we would want to migrate back to Icedove
from claws.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Rationale
=========

Pros
----

* Icedove has a *much* easier guide for setting up an email account -- just enter a name, email address and password, and Icedove will check if the domain of it has IMAP (preferred) or POP, and SMPT, and set up an account correctly and automatically, beginning with trying SSL/STARTTLS so no login credentials are unnecessarily leaked. claws is pretty much impossible to setup for normal people, but seeding the config could make that easier, but will it be as easy?
* Enigmail has a *much* easier guide for generating a key and setting up GnuPG. The guide starts pretty much automatically and is very informative.
* Icedove is more widely used, so it's less fingerprintable and perhaps familiar to more users. This (and its larger development team) also likely results in earlier bug fixes.

Cons
----

* It will be somewhat harder to implement the [[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]] with Icedove compared to claws. That would allow us some flexibility for our use case, e.g. specific recommendations w.r.t. anonymity.
* Icedove's automatic account creation process will fallback to plaintext POP/IMAP/SMTP if SSL/STARTTLS fails. That could result in leaks of login/password in many circumstances, like if the user types the wrong domain in the email address. I can't seem to find any options to disallow plaintext, although mail.smtp.ssl=2 (must use SSL) seems interesting (haven't found anything for POP/IMAP though).
* Icedove requires an additional ~20 MB uncompressed space over claws.
* Icedove probably has more bugs given its code size.

I think implementing the [[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]] is pretty far from trivial, at least if we want it to be as easy as Icedove's account creation guide, which brings that whole idea into question. Maybe a better approach would be to write an addon for Icedove that alters the account creation process (if that is possible -- I have no insight in how much addons can do)? It'd give the user some use case specific information, e.g. to not use a non-anonymous email account, and also implement the other ideas from [[todo/easy_MUA_configuration]]. And it would disallow plaintext plaintext POP/IMAP/SMTP.

Design decisions
================

* Follow the suggestions in [tagnaq's paper](http://bit.ly/qDZm7C)
  as much as possible. We'll likely ignore some impractical stuff
  like using PGP-inline instead of PGP/MIME.

* Our Iceweasel says it prefers English. It does not try to pretend it
  has no locale. Our Icedove shall do the same. So we will keep
  `mailnews.reply_header_authorwrote` default value (that is, `%s
  wrote` and will ignore tagnaq's suggestion on this; details: [doc on
    reply_header_](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Reply_header_settings)

Things to implement
===================

Infrastructure
--------------

[[!tag todo/sysadmin]]

* [[todo/APT_repository]]: this is just too huge to push .deb's to our
  Git => will happen who knows when, but likely before the north
  hemisphere summer is over.
* package buildd (needs a ticket): to allow working on this stuff
  without needing a Ã¼ber-powerful system at $HOME

torbutton-birdy
---------------
[torbutton-birdy](https://github.com/ioerror/torbutton-birdy) aims to
take care of (among other things):

* Enhance the privacy of the emails (prevent email header information
  leaks)
* Protect against all kinds of HTML issues
* Support Tor's prop 171 (stream isolation via per-account proxy
  settings)
* Mixmaster/Mixminion integration.

All these seem terrific, so this is something we definitely want to
include once it's released. Even though it's not mentioned anywhere
one can assume they will deal with the "Spoof User-Agent" issue below
so we don't have to deal with it.

[[!tag todo/wait]]

Spoof User-Agent
----------------

[[!tag todo/code]]

1. pretend to be Thunderbird
2. pretend to be running on the same OS as Firefox Torbutton does
3. pretend to be the Thunderbird version that was current when the
   Firefox version advertised by Torbutton itself was

Modified autoconfig wizard
--------------------------

In order to mitigate the concern's raised by tagnaq about Icedove's
autoconfig wizard, the following changes has been made to it:

* When probing a mail provider for an xml config, first try HTTPS,
  then http (old behaviour: http only).
* Introduce a boolean pref called `mailnews.auto_config_ssl_only`
  (that has a checkbox in the autoconfiguration wizard) that does the
  following when true:
  - Only allow HTTPS when fetching xml configs from mail provider.
  - Only allow HTTPS when fetching xml configs from Mozilla's database
    (luckily the default URL *is* using HTTPS).
  - Don't check DNS MX records for mail configurations. This may need
    some rethinking for DNSSEC.
  - Only accept fetched xml configs that use safe email protocols
    (SSL/TLS for SMTP/IMAP/POP).
  - Only probe the mail server for safe protocols (SSL/TLS for
    SMTP/IMAP/POP).

These changes are implemented in the `secure_account_creation` branch
in a git repository that can be cloned as follow:

    git clone git://labs.riseup.net/tails_icedove.git

The next step is to at least try to get these patches merged upstream,
preferably to Mozilla, but Debian would also be ok.

Things to be checked / researched
=================================

[[!tag todo/research]]

* general privacy/anonymity issues: [tagnaq's
  paper](http://bit.ly/qDZm7C)

found answers
-------------

* how well are Enigmail, Icedove and l10n packages maintained in
  Debian? -> seems acceptable - I've seen much worse times, especially
  for this set of packages.
* how much size does Icedove + Enigmail + l10n packages add to the
  SquashFS compared to Claws Mail? -> *9MB* (as of Tails pre-0.8 devel
  branch with XZ SquashFS compression)
