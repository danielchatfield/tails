With [[GNOME Keyring included|todo/include_gnome-keyring]],
WEP/WPA secrets may be saved for the time of a Tails session.
However, the first time one enters such a secret, a password is asked
to encrypt the keyring.

The GNOME Keyring should be created or initialized in a way that
avoids going through this step.

Seems like Haven had solved this problem: see
`customization-scripts/rootfs/etc/skel/.gnome2/keyrings/` in their
Git repository.
