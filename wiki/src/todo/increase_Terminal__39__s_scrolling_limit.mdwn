The gnome-terminal scrollback limit is, by default, limited to 512. The effect is that the result of some commands is (definitively) lost when is larger than 512 lines.

A solution to increase this size limit is to change a gconf key, probably this one :

**/schemas/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/scrollback_lines**

as explained here :

> [[!taglink todo/done]] in Tails 0.11.
