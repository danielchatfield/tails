As people make more use of the persistant volume it becomes more important that they have an easy way to back up their data. 

The easiest way would probably be a pushbutton clone - possibly in Tails USB Installer, possibly a new Persistent Volume function - that simply duplicates one USB to another of the same size. Any other system that enables one to do a backup and restore to get back to the same place would be fine.
