As people make more use of the persistant volume it becomes more important that they have an easy way to back up their data. 

The easiest way would probably be a pushbutton clone - possibly in Tails USB Installer, possibly a new Persistent Volume function - that simply duplicates one USB to another of the same size. Any other system that enables one to do a backup and restore to get back to the same place would be fine.

>> You could have it in Applications -> Tails -> Backup persistent volume. A dialog box can come up asking to insert either a new USB of the same size, or a USB with an older backup already on it.For new USB's, it should format them, make an encrypted volume, and cp or tar all the files from the current persistent volume. For USB's already containing a backed up persistent volume, it should just mount the volume and replace the files with the current ones 

> Maybe a script that backs up /live/mount/persistence/sdb2_unlocked (sdb is the usb, given i have a internal hdd sda) to another USB flash drive. You would have to use a passphrase to encrypt the tar. an example: tar -cvpz --exclude=/live/mount/persistence/sdb2_unlocked/apt/lists/lock --exclude=/live/mount/persistence/sdb2_unlocked/apt/cache/lock --exclude=/live/mount/persistence/sdb2_unlocked/lost+found /live/mount/persistence/sdb2_unlocked | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e > /media/newusb/tails_backups/$(date +'%Y-%m-%d__%I.%M.%S%p')__UTC.tar.gz.enc
