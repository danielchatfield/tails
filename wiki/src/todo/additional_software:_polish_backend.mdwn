- when the notification fails, logging stdout/stderr/returncode
  of the tails-notify-user
- filter out empty lines from the conf file: else, APT is called in
  a way that makes it crash
- explain the user that most APT lists expire after a week or so, and
  that will make offline packages installation fail after a while
- move the args we always want to pass to apt-get (`--yes` and
  `--quiet`) into `_launch_apt_get`.
- verify the need of a custom apt-get PATH and add a comment to explain if
  it's really needed.

Fixed in `feature/remember_installed_packages`, [[!tag pending]] for Tails
0.20.
