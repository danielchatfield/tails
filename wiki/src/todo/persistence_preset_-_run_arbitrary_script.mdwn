As a persistence feature, running an arbitrary script at boot could be usefull, for example to:

- modify automatically the MAC adress
- reinstall packages
- tweak configuration
- .. everything that can be done with bash

It could eventually allow to run administration commands without having to setup a root password.

(Indeed, most of us setup a root password, and so increase the attack surface, just to modify their MAC adress.)
