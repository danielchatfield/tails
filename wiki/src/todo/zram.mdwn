It might be useful to use `zram` in Tails.

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Rationale

`zram` is a kernel module that makes it possible to use some amount of
RAM as compressed swap. This should allow using a bit more RAM than
what's really available.

# Roadmap

We should:

1. Wait for details from Daniel Baumann about [his testing
   report](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/01/msg00224.html)
   ("i've tested it quite a bit with the idea of enabling it
   automatically on debian-live systems if the machine as not
   a certain amount of physical ram available. had only bad
   experiences with it, so far (worse than without it)").
   Emailed the debian-live ML on April 7th. [[!tag todo/wait]]
1. [[!taglink todo/test]] zram and evaluate:
   * what actual improvements it provides, especially on low-memory systems
   * what the performance cost is, if any.
