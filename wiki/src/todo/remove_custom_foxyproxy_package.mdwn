devel branch currently has a custom foxyproxy package only meant to
bump maxVersion compatibility level to be co-installable with
iceweasel 11.0.

We should report this incompatibility as a bug against foxyproxy in
Debian once iceweasel 11.0 enters unstable.

We should remove this custom package once a suitable one
enters Debian.
