Although Pidgin defaults to the "guest" IRC nick, the IRC username
(and realname?) are set to "amnesia" which helps fingerprinting
amnesia users.

1. First step: set the username and realname to "guest" as well =>
   **done**.
2. Second step: generate a random nick/username/realname at
   session start?

This very commit implements a randomized IRC nick made of:

- a random firstname (picked from the 2000 most registered by the
  U.S. social security administration in the 70s);
- a random number between 1 and 9.

=> tag pending

[[!tag todo/done]]
