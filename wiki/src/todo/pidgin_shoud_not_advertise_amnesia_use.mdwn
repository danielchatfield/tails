Although Pidgin defaults to the "guest" IRC nick, the IRC username
(and realname?) are set to "amnesia" which helps fingerprinting
amnesia users.

1. First step: set the username and realname to "guest" as well =>
   **done**.
2. Second step: generate a random nick/username/realname at
   session start? => [[!taglink todo/discuss]]
