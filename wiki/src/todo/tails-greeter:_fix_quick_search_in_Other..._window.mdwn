In the greeter, the list in the "other..." window (at least for
keyboard layout) has the quick search indexed on something else than
what's displayed.
E.g. typing *es* selects Spain, typing *i* selects Israel, and
typing *ch* selects Switzerland.

Reproduced with the greeter being ported to Wheezy, too.
