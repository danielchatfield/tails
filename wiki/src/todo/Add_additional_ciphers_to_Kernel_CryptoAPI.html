<p>It is beneficial to have a fuller crypto suite available. AES is a great cipher but there are many alternatives which can be used, and they can be used for many good reasons (this request is mainly for additional block ciphers but stream and MACs are important too). Providing Serpent and Twofish would be the most useful, but considering the available algorithms in the recent Kernel providing a larger crypto selection would not have a large impact on the size of the distribution and would be a particular benefit to many users.</p>

>The ciphers mentioned are already compiled and available in Tails. They aren't listed by default by `cat /proc/crypto` as they're distributed as modules and loaded on demand or by using `modprobe`. Done?

> Yes, closing.
