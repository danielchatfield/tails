First, think how the new tordate + torified htpdate implementation
changes why/how this todo item should be implemented.

Currently when it fails the user is shown a popup with the log of the
last execution of HTP. This could be improved by:

  - Not showing the raw logs in the second popup but a nicer explanation
    on the issue with a link to a relevant wiki page, like:

    « Synchronizing the system's clock failed!
    You won't be able to access the Internet.
    __Try to fix it__.

    « Failed to synchronize the clock!
    There might be something wrong with your Internet connectivity
    and Tor might not work correctly.
    __Learn how to fix it__. »

The corresponding wiki page should give hints about:

  - What are the implications of this failure: maybe no network, or-talk
    has been asked for possible security implications.
  - First things to try to fix and retry all that: check your network
    connection.
  - How to study the problem more in details if needed: how to see the
    logs and understand them.
