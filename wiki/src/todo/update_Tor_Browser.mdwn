There are new Tor Broswer Bundles so I think iso image of Tails should be updated: https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en

I think new bundles are with firefox 6.0.1 and new tor/vidalia. 

> Tails does not ship the TBB => irrelevant.
> Tails constantly need to be updated, no need to file bugs to tell
> us => closing.
