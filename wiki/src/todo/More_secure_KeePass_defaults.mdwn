There are some KeePass settings that are arguably not as secure as might be an appropriate default. 

Specifically under Settings->Security locking the database after a certain period of inactivity (perhaps 5 minutes) and locking when minimized might be advisable. 

This could also be resolved by persisting KeePass settings and enabling users to set them as desired.
