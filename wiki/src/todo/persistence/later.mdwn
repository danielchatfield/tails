[[!meta title="Further possible improvements to persistence features"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

# usecases

* [[todo/system_wide_persistence]]
* [[todo/full_home_persistence]]

# storage location

* Use persistence without a persistence media: an encrypted persistent
  archive could be [[remotely stored|todo/remote_persistent_storage]]
  on existing storage services.

# profiles

See [[todo/per-profile_persistence]].

# user interface

* support bootstrapping persistent storage when running from CD; only
  differences probably arise from the fact that partitioning and
  partitions usage are not well-known in this case.
* support *removing* from the list of persistent items
