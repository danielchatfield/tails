It would be great to clean up some identifying information from the
WhisperBack reports:

* MAC addresses
* USB devices serial number
* IP addresses
* more...

LibertÃ© Linux has some shell script to do similar things.

> Serial numbers, UUID, IPs and MACs should be cleaned in whisperback source
> (commit c8a5184)

> Merged in devel, implemented in 0.13.
