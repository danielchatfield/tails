`tordate` may time out if the user takes too much time entering the
bridge info while in "bridge mode". The resulting incorrect clock may
prevent Tor from working at all.

Potential solutions:

* Remove the timeout counter in `tordate` when "bridge mode" is
  activated. This is the easy solution, but would reintroduce the
  issues for which we added the timeout counter in the first place.
* While in "bridge mode", make `tordate` sleep until it detects that a
  bridge has been added, then it proceeds with time syncing. This is a
  bit more involved, but should be possible to do via Tor's control
  port.
