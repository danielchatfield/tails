# Summary

We want to allow users to choose, once for all, their preferred language
and keyboard layout, in a way that their elected settings are saved in
the Tails *system* **cleartext** partition.

# User story

As a Norvegian-speaking Tails user:

1. In the Tails USB Installer, I choose Norvegian language and
   keyboard layout.
1. I boot Tails.
1. tails-greeter is displayed to me in Norvegian, with a Norvegian
   keyboard layout.
1. I may type my persistent volume passphrase using my preferred
   keyboard layout, without the need to tell Tails about it
   once again.
1. I should be proposed to choose another language and keyboard layout
   in tails-greeter, still.

# Implementation

## liveusb-creator

We will move the language/keyboard layout decision to the **Tails
installation** time of the user experience. It must be made clear to
the user that the result of this decision is written in *cleartext* on
the USB stick.

## tails-greeter

Currently, tails-greeter has problems being started in any locale but
C. Easiest way to workaround this problem is to unconditionally start
tails-greeter with C locales, and once it gets information about the
desired language, then it applies it to the GUI.
