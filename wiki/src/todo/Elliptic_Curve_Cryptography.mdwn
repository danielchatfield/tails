There is an alarming trend in Debian-derived distributions towards standardizing all cryptography on AES.  AES is a fast protocol and generally thought (late 2012) to be practically secure, but AES has some alarming properties which suggest that it may be dangerous to rely upon it exclusively.  In particular, AES may be vulnerable to algebraic attacks on which our adversaries are known to be hard at work.

Similarly, it would be wise to avoid relying exclusively on authentication or cryto protocols which assume that factoring large integers (satisfying certain properties) is hard.  In late 2012 this is thought to be hard, but it keeps getting easier, and it appears to be impossible to rule out the possibility of an unforeseen breathrough in the near future which might have dramatic effects.

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) shares many conceptual similarities with more familiar approaches, but (in late 2012) 

* is thought to be significantly harder to crack

* appears to offer a better ratio of key size to cryptographic strength.  

The first property makes ECC attractive as a fallback in case standard protocols ever become practically broken.  The second property makes ECC attractive for ephemeral key cryptography, which is potentially much better suited for users seeking privacy, authentication, and anonymity in end-to-end communications.

Debian stable ships with an ECC tool, seccure, but I am not sure how easily that could be adapted for use in Tails.  Still, I think ECC probably deserves a place somewhere on the Tails wishlist.  

Particularly desirable (and ambitious) would be providing tools which enable Tails users to employ ECC with steganography.  Or to encrypt entire volumes and steganographically hide them on a USB stick.
