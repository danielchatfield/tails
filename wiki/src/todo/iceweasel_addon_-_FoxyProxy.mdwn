This is what's said about [FoxyProxy](http://getfoxyproxy.org/) in the
[Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#extensionconflicts):

> While FoxyProxy is a nice idea in theory, in practice it is
  impossible  to configure securely for Tor usage without
  Torbutton. Like all vanilla third party proxy plugins, the main
  risks are plugin leakage and history disclosure, followed closely by
  cookie theft by exit nodes and tracking by adservers (see the
  Torbutton Adversary Model for more information). However, with
  Torbutton installed in tandem and always enabled, it is possible to
  configure FoxyProxy securely (though it is tricky). Since
  FoxyProxy's 'Patterns' mode only applies to specific urls, and not
  to an entire tab, setting FoxyProxy to only send specific sites
  through Tor will still allow adservers (whose hosts don't match your
  filters) to learn your real IP. Worse, when sites use offsite
  logging services such as Google Analytics, you will still end up in
  their logs with your real IP. Malicious exit nodes can also
  cooperate with sites to inject images into pages that bypass your
  filters. Setting FoxyProxy to only send certain URLs via Non-Tor is
  much more secure in this regard, but be very careful with the
  filters you allow. For example, something as simple as allowing
  *google* to go via Non-Tor will still cause you to end up in all the
  logs of all websites that use Google Analytics! See this question on
  the FoxyProxy FAQ for more information.

We want to use FoxyProxy to handle [[I2P
integration|contribute/design/I2P]] in iceweasel. Our filters are
just used to make the correct proxy being used for a given url, so the
"critique" in the Torbutton FAQ doesn't really apply
w.r.t. security. Our main concern is that the experience will be
seamless for the user, i.e. that:

* I2P eepsites (i.e. .i2p tld sites) are proxied through I2P.

* the rest is proxied through Tor.

However, security issues should not be ruled out. It remains to
investigate whether the current (devel branch as of 2010-10-12) setup
allows any attacks. Some possible attack vectors and other things to
meditate upon are:

* how does the "exclude localhost,127.0.0.1 from proxying" part of
  Torbutton work together with FoxyProxy?

 - Seems to work, at least the filter for reaching the I2P router
   console on localhost:7657 is working.

* are there any *good* corellation/fingerprinting/$other attacks that
  rely on html pages that refer to elements that will be fetched both
  through Tor and I2P?

 - One possible attack of this kind depends on that there's some sort
   of nefarious bug/"feature" in I2P which makes the I2P client
   connect to some arbitrary host on the Internet. An attacker
   controlling the target webserver (or running the Tor exit used in
   the case of a non-authenticated connection) could exploit that bug
   to make the I2P client connect *directly* to some host under the
   attacker's control. Of course, this is a bug of apocalyptic
   proportions in I2P, but the point is that bugs in I2P might very
   well open up for attacks on Torified connections with this
   FoxyProxy setup.

* are the regexps for the whitelist filters correct? can some urls
  escape their intended whitelist filter and be catched by another
  one, possibly making it unreachable?

* do non-ascii urls pose any problems for the regexps?
