This is what's said about [FoxyProxy](http://getfoxyproxy.org/) in the
[Torbutton FAQ](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/torbutton-faq.html.en#extensionconflicts):

> While FoxyProxy is a nice idea in theory, in practice it is
  impossible  to configure securely for Tor usage without
  Torbutton. Like all vanilla third party proxy plugins, the main
  risks are plugin leakage and history disclosure, followed closely by
  cookie theft by exit nodes and tracking by adservers (see the
  Torbutton Adversary Model for more information). However, with
  Torbutton installed in tandem and always enabled, it is possible to
  configure FoxyProxy securely (though it is tricky). Since
  FoxyProxy's 'Patterns' mode only applies to specific urls, and not
  to an entire tab, setting FoxyProxy to only send specific sites
  through Tor will still allow adservers (whose hosts don't match your
  filters) to learn your real IP. Worse, when sites use offsite
  logging services such as Google Analytics, you will still end up in
  their logs with your real IP. Malicious exit nodes can also
  cooperate with sites to inject images into pages that bypass your
  filters. Setting FoxyProxy to only send certain URLs via Non-Tor is
  much more secure in this regard, but be very careful with the
  filters you allow. For example, something as simple as allowing
  *google* to go via Non-Tor will still cause you to end up in all the
  logs of all websites that use Google Analytics! See this question on
  the FoxyProxy FAQ for more information.

We want to use FoxyProxy to handle [[I2P
integration|contribute/design/I2P]] and maybe [[FTP
support|FTP_in_Iceweasel]] in Iceweasel. Our filters are
just used to make the correct proxy being used for a given url, so the
"critique" in the Torbutton FAQ doesn't really apply
w.r.t. security. Our main concern is that the experience will be
seamless for the user, i.e. that:

* I2P eepsites (i.e. .i2p tld sites) are proxied through I2P.

* the rest is proxied through Tor.
