[[wishlist]]

This is something we may, or may not, want to support once other
[[persistence]] usecases are supported.

All of /home is persistent. This is very convenient for users who
have complex configurations for certain applications, like IMs,
MUAs, gpg an the like.

On the other hand clueless users could do really bad configurations that would
persist and thus expose them even after a reboot.

Also Tails upgrades to configurations in $HOME would be pretty
difficult to apply without breaking the users own configuration.

Great care should be given to the potential leaks of web browser
cache and history, IM logs and similar applications and their
data, so that even if the /home is compromised, it should be
difficult for the attacker to tell what exact internet resources
and services have been used. Unless the user has explicitly
chosen to store such information (bookmarking a site, adding
someone to their contact list or address book, activated IM chat
logs etc.).

Implementation
==============

**Beware!** We're not even sure we want to support this usecase at all
ever.

The "home automounting" flavor seems like a nice starting point to
implement full /home persistency but it needs to be extended so that
`$HOME` persistence can be enabled while full persistence is disabled.
This is easy to implement and contribute to the upstream `live-boot`
(everything happens in `scripts/live`).
