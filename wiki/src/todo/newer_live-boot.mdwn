Tails ships a relatively old live-boot. We need to resync' with upstream.

Pros (aside from the obvious):

* some persistence bugfixes that may improve data resilience
* once done, we might benefit from the new "Reading configuration file
  from filesystem and live-media at runtime too" feature to make our
  kernel command-line shorter

This is being worked on in the `feature/live-boot-3.x` branch.

Next things to do
=================

* now that basic functionality was tested and works with the
  updated live stuff, one should test more advanced features that may
  be affected by the update, such as: [[!tag todo/test]]
  - persistence
  - emergency shutdown
* live-boot mounts now live in `/lib/live/mount`, and `/live/image`
  now lives in `/lib/live/mount/medium`; should be updated
  accordingly: [[!tag todo/code]]
  - liveusb-creator: `liveusb/config.py`
  - tails-iuk: `lib/Tails/IUK/Install.pm`
  - tails-persistence-setup: `lib/Tails/Persistence/Setup.pm`

Done
====

* everything moved from `/live` to `/lib/live`, and might move again
  to `/lib/live/mount` (e.g. we rely on `/live/image`): so we ship
  a compatibility symlink first, be done with it on the
  short term, and we will then adapt our scripts and programs one
  after the other.
