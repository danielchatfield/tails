Tails ships a relatively old live-boot. We need to resync' with upstream.

Pros (aside from the obvious):

* some persistence bugfixes that may improve data resilience
* once done, we might benefit from the new "Reading configuration file
  from filesystem and live-media at runtime too" feature to make our
  kernel command-line shorter

This is being worked on in the `feature/live-boot-3.x` branch.

Next things to do
=================

0. [[!taglink todo/qa]] current `feature/live-boot-3.x` branch
0. update our custom programs to match the move of `/live/image` to
   `/lib/live/mount/medium` (they currently still work thanks to
   a compatibility symlink): [[!tag todo/code]]
   - liveusb-creator: `liveusb/config.py`
   - tails-iuk: `lib/Tails/IUK/Install.pm`
   - tails-persistence-setup: `lib/Tails/Persistence/Setup.pm`
0. merge these programs in time for 0.16
0. split the following tasks into their own tickets
0. in 0.17 or later, remove our `/live` and `/live/image`
   compatibility symlinks, hope nothing breaks, see what breaks, fix

Done
====

* everything moved from `/live` to `/lib/live`, and `/live/image` moved
  to `/lib/live/mount/medium`: so we ship
  compatibility symlinks first, be done with it on the
  short term, and we will then adapt our scripts and programs one
  after the other.
* tested:
  - basic functionality
  - persistence
  - emergency shutdown
    * USB stick installed by the Tails USB installer
    * USB stick installed the isohybrid + cat old-school way
    * from DVD
  - liveusb-installer (Clone and install, Clone and upgrade: OK;
    upgrade from ISO should not be affected by these changes)
