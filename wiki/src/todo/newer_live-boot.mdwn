This is being worked on in the `feature/live-boot-3.x` branch.

Next things to do
=================

Tails 0.17 has a recent live-boot.
Most of the rest is [[!taglink pending]] for 0.18.

Next steps are:

0. upgrade to [[todo/live-boot_3.0_final]]
0. [[todo/remove_live-boot_compatibility_symlinks]]

Done
====

* everything moved from `/live` to `/lib/live`, and `/live/image` moved
  to `/lib/live/mount/medium`: so we ship
  compatibility symlinks first, be done with it on the
  short term, and we will then adapt our scripts and programs one
  after the other.
* tested:
  - basic functionality
  - persistence
  - emergency shutdown
    * USB stick installed by the Tails USB installer
    * USB stick installed the isohybrid + cat old-school way
    * from DVD
  - liveusb-installer (Clone and install, Clone and upgrade: OK;
    upgrade from ISO should not be affected by these changes)
* merged for 0.17
0. update our custom (liveusb-creator, tails-iuk,
   tails-persistence-setup) programs to match the move of
   `/live/image` to `/lib/live/mount/medium` (they currently still
   work thanks to a compatibility symlink): **done** in the
   `feature-live-boot-3.x` APT suite (merged into the `experimental`
   one)
0. merged the `feature-live-boot-3.x` APT suite. The affected code paths has
   been quickly tested already. Pending for 0.18
