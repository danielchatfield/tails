I simply CAN't work out a DSL connection, even after manually installing pppoe and pppoeconf, running the pppoeconfig script and starting up the ppp0 interface. Now in ifconfig, everything looks alright... DHCP was picked up, got an IP adress assigned and all that, but still NO connection, and the Network Manager applet doesn't show anything. Trying to start a connection with "auto eth0", it searches for a signal and then disconnects. 

This is a bit frustrating, since I can't use this great distro. Seems like nm is getting in the way of letting the DSL connection go through, probably due to some conflict, but I don't have the time to go through these tiny coding details.

It seems like if it would be already built-up in the system, this wouldn't be an issue. Most distros have it installed by default, so why Tails wouldn't?

Anyways, thanks and congrats for the good work!
