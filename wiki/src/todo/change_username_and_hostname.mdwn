As suggested by adrelanos on [Tails-dev - Let's share username, /etc/hostname and /etc/host among all anonymity distributions](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002457.html)

    username: user
    /etc/hostname: host
    /etc/hosts: 127.0.0.1 host.localdomain host

No convincing reason not to do this [was
provided](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-April/002830.html),
so we decided to do it.
