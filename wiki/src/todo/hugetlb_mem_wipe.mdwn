Using a custom memory wiping program from initramfs is implemented in
the `feature/hugetlb_mem_wipe` branch.

It makes the wipe much faster and better looking, but it's not as
efficient as Tails' current parallel sdmem approach when using a PAE
kernel (which usually results in 0 occurrences in my tests, if not
it's just a few hundred occurences), which arguably is what most users
will use. For the non-PAE kernel I believe this branch is
better, though.

**Next thing to do**: fine tune the algorithm parameters and/or memory
settings to be as efficient on PAE than current implementation.

# Test results

Both tests performed in the same 8 GiB-RAM VM:

* With PAE-kernel:     137K occurences ≃ 2.1 MiB of unwiped memory.
* With non-PAE-kernel: 155K occurences ≃ 2.4 MiB of unwiped memory.
