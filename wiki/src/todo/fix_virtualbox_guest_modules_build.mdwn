Tails 0.17.1 brings a regression: VirtualBox guest modules are not
built during the Tails ISO build. We should fix this.

A current build fails too, but that's presumably due to [[!debbug
703812]], so we'll have to [[!taglink todo/wait]] for this Debian bug
to be fixed before we can easily debug the other issue.

[[!tag todo/code]]
