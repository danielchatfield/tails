adrelanos (Whonix developer) suggests:

It would be nice if Tails Tor integration could be disabled and if therefore a custom [transparent proxy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TransparentProxy) could be used.

Or even better, to prevent identity correlation, if an isolating proxy such as [Whonix](http://whonix.sourceforge.net/) could be used. Whonix currently consists of a Gateway and a Workstation. The Workstation's client operating system is a Debian GNU/Linux derivative. Tails could also run fine as client os.

Tails and Whonix-Gateway currently use different SocksPorts for stream isolation, these should be standardized.
