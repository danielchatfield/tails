- Tails includes a coherent but limited set of applications. More
  applications can be installed as on any Debian installation.
- Since Tails is amnesic they need to be reinstalled for each working
  session. See [[remember_installed_packages]].
- Document better how to use the APT features of the persistence.
- Document how to use Synaptic.
- Discuss if we want to include other ways of installing packages
  (software-center?).
