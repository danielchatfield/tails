Currently we use [[tordate|contribute/design/Time_syncing]] to set the
inital clock. It's very messy and error prone, so we desperately need
a robust replacement.

Possible solutions:

* [[Authenticated NTP|todo/authenticate_time_servers]]
  - Easy to fingerprint due to low usage.
* [tlsdate](https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate)
  - Easy to fingerprint due to low usage.
* Extend Tor some how, e.g.
  * [like arma suggested](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-January/008551.html).
  * [answer network time requests](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6894)
