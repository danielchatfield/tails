Currently we use [[tordate|contribute/design/Time_syncing]] to set the
inital clock. It's very messy and error prone, so we desperately need
a robust replacement.

Possible solutions:

* [[Authenticated NTP|todo/authenticate_time_servers]]
  - Easy to fingerprint due to low usage.
* [tlsdate](https://github.com/ioerror/tlsdate)
  - Used by ChromeOS on every network up event => no longer "easy to
    fingerprint due to low usage" *iff* we use it exactly in the same
    way (e.g. ask the very same HTTPS servers) as ChromeOS, and go on
    doing so forever.
    * their (outdated) [design doc](https://docs.google.com/a/chromium.org/document/d/1ylaCHabUIHoKRJQWhBxqQ5Vck270fX7XCWBdiJofHbU/edit)
    * their [tlsdate clone](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromiumos/third_party/tlsdate.git;a=summary)
    * their [upstart job](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=chromiumos/platform/init.git;a=blob;f=tlsdated.conf;h=d72d780c1f1d432bb7b7a06e787a745dbf5cdd46;hb=HEAD)
    * They query `clients3.google.com` only currently, but intend to
      use the multi-host feature some day.
- Packaged for Debian.
* Extend Tor some how, e.g.
  * [like arma suggested](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-January/008551.html).
  * [answer network time requests](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6894)
