Which CTCP replies should Pidgin reply to over IRC? In 0.8-rc2 it
responds to PING and VERSION (with "Purple IRC"), but before that it
didn't respond to any CTCP query. We need to assess which ones are
safe or even desireable w.r.t. fingerprintability (e.g vs. "normal"
Pidgin users) and other leaks.

> In Tails 0.14, it looks like Pidgin does not reply to `VERSION` and
> `PING` anymore. Should be tested again, confirmed, and
> hopefully closed.
