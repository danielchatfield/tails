We've been asked to include Bitcoin.

Quoting the Debian package description: "Full transaction history is
stored locally at each client. This requires 150+ MB of space, slowly
growing", so persistence is needed.

The only missing bit, then, is remembering to install a Bitcoin client
that was cached in the persistence storage. The correct way to deal
with such feature requests probably is to implement
[[todo/remember_installed_packages]].

So, we will *not* include Bitcoin software in Tails.

>> I'm happy if Tails allows you to install such a client.
