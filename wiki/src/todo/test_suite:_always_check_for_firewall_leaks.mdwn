Should we check for firewall leaks in every scenario, or at least, in
every scenario that involves the Internet?

[[!tag todo/discuss]]

Actually, we don't want to do it for all features/scenarios involving
the Internet (think about e.g. `unsafe_browser.feature`). Instead we
could:

1. add a tag `@uses_tor` (which is relevant for other things, like
   [[retrying when Tor fails|test_suite:_retry_when_tor_fails]]) to
   all features/scenarios that uses Tor.

2. add a `Before('@uses_tor')` hook that starts the sniffer, and a
   `After('@uses_tor')` hook that check for leaks.

We'd still keep the current firewall leak checker steps for the
features and scenarios that need more control, like the
`firewall_leaks.feature`:s anti-tests.
