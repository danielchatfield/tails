As mentioned on the forum in
[[/forum/using_DownThemAll___40__iceweasle_firefox_addon__41__]], it
might be useful to include a download managar in Tails.

A usecase could be to try to download a big file across separate working
sessions.

Was discussed on tails-dev (`Message-Id:
<hDDmk9meHE6Wi1DnIw1j0UTab3VmKqKs@alan-schleuder>`), general opinion
was favorable to support the aforementioned usecase.

One should now [[!taglink todo/test]] and compare the available tools:

* [[!debpkg xul-ext-downthemall]]
* [uget](http://urlget.sourceforge.net/) - easy-to-use download
  manager written in GTK+: from the package long description, looks
  a bit too feature-full.
* steadyflow - Simple download manager for GNOME: in Wheezy, not in
  Squeeze; a quick look at the build-deps makes me think a backport
  is doable. Aims for minimalism and ease of use.
* multiget - graphical download manager: in Squeeze and Wheezy; from
  the package long description, looks a bit too feature-full.
* kget: depends on many parts of KDE, so that's a no.
