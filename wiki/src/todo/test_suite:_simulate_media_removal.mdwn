While it's possible to tell libvirt to forcefully remove both DVD and
USB media, it doesn't result in the signal (or whatever) that our udev
watchdog looks for. The media just gets broken with lots of IO errors
happening. This prevents implementation of the tests:

* erase memory on shutdown
  - After booting from DVD, remove Tails boot medium and check that
    the memory erasure process is started (`Loading new kernel`, at
    least).  The USB tests are bellow, in the USB installer section.

* USB Installer/Upgrader
  - The installed or upgraded Tails medium shall have the "emergency
    shutdown on boot medium removal" feature working: remove Tails
    boot medium and check that the memory erasure process is started
    (`Loading new kernel`, at least).

We need to [[!taglink todo/research]] if we can fix this, or if it's
an upstream bug.
