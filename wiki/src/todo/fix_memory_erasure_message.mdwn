How to reproduce:

- select french language
- shutdown

The memory erasure message incorrectly shows the accented characters.

0. [[!taglink todo/test]] if the problem is merely about missing chars
   in the font, or about encoding issues
0. if it's encoding issues, then: the `tails-kexec` initscript
   contains these messages, encoded in UTF-8. Perhaps the console
   default locale should be set to a UTF-8 one.
   Is `C.UTF-8` available on Squeeze?
