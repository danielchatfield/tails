I couldn't find out your names and location. No problem, I prefer to stay anonymous myself.

May I ask for your reasons to stay anonymous?

But since your are deploying software you should line that out somewhere.

Since some debian developers singed your gpg key. They know you in person and you are not 100% anonymous?

And I wonder why torproject.org trusts you? Do they know you in person?

It be nice if you could answer these questions without removing your anonymity. It were interesting if you could offer at least some information.
