No I started tails with persistent option and admin password and except automatical loading Persistent folder, all the rest is the same it means my changes are not saved. 

panel properties is the same, sound level is the same, iceweasel and keyboard layout are the same, I don't see truecrypt in aplication-accessories, there is no bluefish and filezilla... so, I lost 2 hours of changes for nothing... every time I start tails, I must make changes and the only use of persistence is to have 2GB folder for my files. at least in this folder I can export bookmarks from iceweasel and import it again every time I use tails.  

now I tried again apt-get update and it begins again from scratch, like that I never did it before.

is there any solution for my problem? can i save all these changed which are not saved?
