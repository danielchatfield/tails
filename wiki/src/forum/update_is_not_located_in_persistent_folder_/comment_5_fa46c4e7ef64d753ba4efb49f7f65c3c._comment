Your best bet at this point is to write a simple shell-script that will install the packages you want for you, so you don't have to do it all manually after a restart. As mentioned, the packages **are** on your persistent drive, located (for me anyway, may be different for you) at **/live/persistent/sdb2_unlocked/apt/cache**

I wrote a script with gedit that installs the bluefish deb package from my tails USB when I run it:

    #!/bin/bash
    sudo dpkg -i /live/persistent/sdb2_unlocked/apt/cache/bluefish_2.0.1-1_i386.deb

I added a whole bunch of commands on my shell script that changes my mac address, starts i2p, and installs all the programs I need. If you run your script through root terminal you won't need to add the sudo commands to it, since it can be annoying typing in your password 15 times after you run the script. It actually doesn't take as long to write a single shell-script for everything you need as you might think. Just store it in your Persistent folder and run it whenever you start. Done and done.

If you need help learning how to write shell-script, here's a nice tutorial
