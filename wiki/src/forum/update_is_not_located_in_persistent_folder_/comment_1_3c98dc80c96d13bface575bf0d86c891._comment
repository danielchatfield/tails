hm, all this folders are visible because I checked View-Show hidden files. it is there in any case, just now after restart I didn't use persistence and all changes are not saved than I could just login with password to persistence folder and then i got TailsData mounted. inside are folders apt, clawsmails, dotfiles, gnupg, Persistent, and so on. 

now I will restart with using persistence, so, I will see if changes for icewiesel, etc are saved or not.
