I was wondering what "~~squeeze+1" means here? 

Also, and I think this was discussed in another thread, according to the Tor blog "all users who were using Tor 0.2.3.22-rc1 are strongly encouraged to upgrade." Since Tor 0.2.3.22-rc-1 is bundled with Tails 0.14-rc2 (and possibly with stable 0.14) does this mean Tails users are at risk?
