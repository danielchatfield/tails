In Tails you don't need to use proxies like `onion.to` or `tor2web.org` to reach hidden services (they're bottlenecks and can MitM you, so using them results in worse performance and security). Just visit the `.onion` site directly in Tails' iceweasel, e.g. <http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion> for TorMail's hidden service.
