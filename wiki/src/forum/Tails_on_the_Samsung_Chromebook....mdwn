Pardon my ignorance if this has already been discussed (I did use the search function), but I was wondering how possible it would be to get Tails on the Samsung Chromebook (link: http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-XE303C12-A01US-Chromebook-Wi-Fi-11-6-Inch/dp/B009LL9VDG)?

I know Ubuntu has been successfully installed with only a few minor tweaks, but I was wondering whether a live version of Tails would be a difficult undertaking? I'm reasonably decent with Linux, but not a developer by a long shot. Has there even been any talk about this? I currently use Tails on my desktop very successfully, but I just got a new Chromebook and would love to get it running on there!

Many thanks in advance!
