Tails 0.10.1 is a release aimed at fixing serious bugs. Every other change we could have included, would have made the release happen later. We did not see any security-related changes in the i2p 0.8.12 announce, and it did not seem worth delaying the release any further. In short: we are doing our best with limited time :)

We could probably make use of more i2p-related energy. Help is welcome.
