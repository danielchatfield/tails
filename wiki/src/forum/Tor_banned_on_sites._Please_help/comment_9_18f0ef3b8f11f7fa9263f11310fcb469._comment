@ comment 8:

Sounds like you may be confusing *web-based* proxies (mentioned in comments 4, 6 and 7) with *VPN*s (comment 5).

All the *web proxies* I have seen are \"free\" (in the sense that they no require no payment to use).

>\"They\" can also correlate all your Torified traffic 

A *web proxy* should only be able to correlate whatever traffic you put through the web proxy. 

Of course, if the operators of a web proxy were to invade and gain control of your system, well, then all bets would probably off. But that is also true for *anyone* who would gain control of your system.
