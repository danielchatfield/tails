I dont have a VPS but I managed to get a VPN account now, but I couldnt get it to work in tails. any idea how?

The web proxies I tried fail in signup pages becuase they do not support \"GET\" and \"POST\" functions

If someone has a web proxy that works with signup please provide a link

I only need a single exit after tor in anyway that would work. proxy, vpn it doesnt matter.

any help?
