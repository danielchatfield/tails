> If you are using a RAT in tails are all connections going through Tor? How can you be traced?

All TCP connections go through Tor, all UDP packets are dropped. So in order for your RAT to work you'd have to use one based on TCP. Even if it uses UDP there should be no leakage, the RAT would just not be able to connect. Of course, we have not conducted any research on whether any existing RATs leak identifying information on the application level, so use it at your own risk.

I fail to understand what you mean.
