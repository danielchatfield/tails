It is possible to create a persistent volume with the USB install.  Though if you create a data partition on a USB with the encryption flag then as you boot Tails from CD I note it does seem to find the encrypted USB drive and ask you if you want to unlock it.  It can be found mounted under the live system dir:

`amnesia@amnesia:~$ ln -s /live/persistence/sdb1_unlocked/Persistent`

will link a dir on the USB called 'Persistent' to the current dir.
