"Sorry. You are not using Tor."

At least, that's what Tor Check says. Every other indication is that I am using Tor, but the "sorry" message in big red letters is still disconcerting.

So, should I be worried?


Additional info:

Tor check reports that my "IP address appears to be: 38.229.70.31". The hostname for this address is sergii.torproject.org.
