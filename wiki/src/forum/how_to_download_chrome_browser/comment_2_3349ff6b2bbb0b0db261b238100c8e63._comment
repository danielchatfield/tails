>What distribution does tails come under, Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, or what?

\"Linux\" is not a distro. Linux is the *kernel* upon which all the distros you named-- and hundreds, if not thousands more-- are built upon.

Most of the time, when people say \"Linux\" what they really mean would be more properly termed, \"GNU/Linux\" or \"GNU+Linux\", or \"Linux-based\".
