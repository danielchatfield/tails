Hi, it's my first time askign on this forum, apparently didnt need to sign up or log in; i just started using TAILS live from USB for first time, with Macchanger, seems interesting for learning about privacy and networking. 
I have a problem using video sites like youtube, i've searched the web extensively and couldnt find a real answer, just more questions. Is there a way to get it to work? I disabled the TOR preference in security settings, dynamic content, the first one about plugins. I have noscript as default allowing globally; still when i try to play a youtube video it asks me to install missing plugins and it then notifies me there is no plugings available. It seems that the only alternative is to use the "unsafe web broser", but it isn't recommended and defeats the purpose of anonymity; or doesnt it?
If possible, is there a way to get tor iceweasel in tails to allow youtube and other flash sites?
thanks
