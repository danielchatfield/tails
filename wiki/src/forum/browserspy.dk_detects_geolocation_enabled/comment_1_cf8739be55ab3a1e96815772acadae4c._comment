The Iceweasel geolocation feature is, I think, an implementation of a w3c standard that allows the browser to communicate what it knows about your location to websites that ask for it. I'm pretty sure Iceweasel in Tails does not know your real location, so there's not much it can leak.

Torbutton protects against many other much more grave issues. Hence we won't rename it \"geolocation\". Torbutton is an essential part of the security/privacy/anonymity Tails can provide, so turning it off is a bad idea anyway, and I don't think we ever advised anyone to do so. Anyone turning off Tails security features cannot ask Tails to protect her/him.

In Tails 0.7.1, with Torbutton enabled, browserspy pretends geolocation is enabled, which is weird since the `geo.enabled` Iceweasel setting is set to `false`. Browserspy anyway reports the location of the Tor exit node I'm using so I'd call this a non-issue.

About replacing Iceweasel with another browser, it's pretty simple: others are currently much worse because nothing such as Torbutton exists for any browser but Firefox / Iceweasel.
