hi!

i already searched here and on the internet but in the cloud i only found guides relating to machines with tor and nothing about the tails distri...

how can i chain a socks proxy behind tor like:
tor > socks > inet ?

could some pinux/unix pro explain me how to do this or has a link where i can get the info even if i had to read a lot. ok, if i read a lot in the first place i wouldnt have to ask and would hit they keys instead.

thanks for any help!

bye
