Whenever I boot from Tails LiveDVD, just after I have chosen "Tails" (not "Tails (Failsafe)"), there is a screen with black background with a message.

I am only able to catch a few words. They are "Failed to load MSI-X".

What does it mean?

Is it essential to load MSI-X?

How do I pause the screen so that I can copy down the whole text of the error message?
