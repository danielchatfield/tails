First, I must state that I am in no way related to any of the Tails developers.

Second, I work and live under an oppressive regime in an Asian country where internet censorship is the norm.

Third, since the day my friend recommended Tails to me, I have found it to be the answer to freedom of expression on the net.

I hope that we can donate in some way to the development of Tails.

What do you guys, the users, think of my proposal?
