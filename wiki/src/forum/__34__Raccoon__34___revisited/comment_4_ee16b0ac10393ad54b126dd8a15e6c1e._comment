Re Comment 3:

I wrote the OP.  Other anons wrote Comments 1,2,3.  In principle, we are all \"indistinguishable\" anons here.  In practice... but that's a topic for another thread.

@ Commentator 1:

> General Tor theory is better discussed on a more popular and appropriate forum. Tor-talk? 

I think you mean well, but you should let the forum moderator speak for himself.  I explained in the OP why I think that this thread IS appropriate in the forum, but of course I will defer to the moderator if he disagrees.

I didn't make this sufficiently clear in the OP, but in the other thread I mentioned, \"Tails\" suggested that I read the Tor Talk post cited in the OP.  I did read it, I thought about it, and this thread is my response.
