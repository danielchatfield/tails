\"However, as Tails is based on debian live and using network-manager for its network configuration, it introduces new questions: what if an USB wireless dongle is inserted in Tails after it has booted? Network manager will automatically begin to scan the network with a non-fake mac address. Is it a problem?\"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, that would be a problem. Thanx  for pointing it out , this obvious development somehow escaped me. So for now the solution I guess would be to disable the NetworkManager , connect the dongle, change it's MAC and restart the Network Manager, is that correct?
