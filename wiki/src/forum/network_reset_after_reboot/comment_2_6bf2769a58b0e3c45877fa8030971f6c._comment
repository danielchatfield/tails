\"Tails is amnesic\"
yes i know.

I mean: 
When i start Tails network is enabled and working \"out of the box\"-when router is online(-:.
If i'am surfing on old computer with lower memory on a site with bigger pictures (with or without hazardous content i don't know) browser/system freeze totally,hangs or crash.
After hang i can end browser sometimes and work on.After browsercrash system crashs too.Now i may get the shell after some like heavy ctrl-c
plus kill command,Tails is warm-rebooting with instantly 'Forward'-window to login.
Or browser crashs and automatic warm-rebooting with instantly 'Forward'-window to login.

Have not all these situations in memory -work on some PCs with d√≠fferent configurations- but on one of these, old PC,High-Res pictures&browsercrashing,automatic warm-rebooting with instantly 'Forward'-window to login, i set a new password, Gnome surface loads with all loaded before in 'Desktop'directory(good boy!).
But must set new network settings in Network Connection window.Network is not working \"out of the box\".And top-bar icons are little bit scrambled.
