If I understand it clearly, what you're experiencing is not a *reboot*, but apparently you are killing the GNOME session somehow and seeing GDM / tails-greeter reappear and allow you to login again. The behaviour of Tails in out-of-memory conditions in undefined, and you should not assume Tails should work normally in such cases, so I suggest rebooting for real.
