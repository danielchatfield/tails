here in tails forum there are two treads dealing with the topic of which anonymous webmail to choose. You should have checked before and I encorage you to do so now.

Still, if you have javascript concerned perhaps tormail can be the solution for you.
It provides two diferent webmails, roundcube (with javascript) or squirel mail (no javscript) - it says on the website webmail for nuts which I believe means for the user with a helthy level of paranoia as me.
