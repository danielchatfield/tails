Hi!
Sorry for my bad english too :)

So, i m new to tails too, and i goggled for that question.. In fact, it seems true on the olds browser like netscape and co..

Tails blocks all connection outside Tor, so I think this is a minimal risc. Not really safe, but i have tested with an free mail (y!) provider who put real IP in the headers of sent mails.

With tor and tor button (not only proxy) and tails the ip seems to be my tor ip, and it sound good.. the receiver doesn't know your real ip..

The big probleme if you want to use a free good mail provider, that they use Js, so we have no choice :(. The bulk mails, like yopmail uses it too..

This question is really a good question, i have found this interessant thread : http://bytes.com/topic/javascript/answers/159182-obtaining-client-ip-address-using-javascript-only-so-tor-not-really-anonoymous.

Is someone can elobarate on that, it will be helpfull, thanxs.

Taxiom
