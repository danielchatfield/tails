(It would obviously appear that you meant to write \"ip\" and not \"tp\" as you did.)

You don't mean this *Tails forum*, do you? 

Assuming you do not, it would be much clearer to write something like, \"On a certain web forum\", or, \"On certain web sites\", and not, \"On the forum on the website\", as you did.
