On the forum on the website i getting regular a message that tp i use is banned.

(It would obviously appear that you meant to write \"ip\" and not \"tp\" as you did.)

You don't mean this Tails forum, do you?

Assuming you do not, it would be much clearer to write something like, \"On a certain web forum\", or, \"On certain web sites\", and not, \"On the forum on the website\", as you did.

<end past>

My englisch is not that good. 
You are right i should be
\" On a certain web forum \"  and tp is ip of course.  
That brings me to the orginal question how to prevent that Tor switch drom ip or
how to keep a certain ip.

thanks in advance
