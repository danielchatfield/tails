I'm running Tails 0.10.1 from a CD on a MacBook Pro 13" (early 2011). When running OSX, the computer connects to a wifi network which broadcasts it's SSID and uses WPA Personal authentication, no problem. When I boot into Tails, the network list shows "Wireless Networks - Disconnected."

When I manually add the network from the network utility, there is no change -- no connection. When I use the "Connect to Hidden Wireless Network" option, I immediately get a pop-up window "The wireless network has been disconnected".

here is the result of running iwconfig as root:

root@amnesia:/home/amnesia# iwconfig
lo        no wireless extensions.

wlan0     IEEE 802.11bg  ESSID:off/any  
          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=0 dBm   
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:on
          
eth0      no wireless extensions.

When I connect the computer to a wired network while running Tails, everything works fine.
