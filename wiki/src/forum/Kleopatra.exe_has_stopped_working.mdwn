This may not be the correct place to post this....
I'm trying to verify the Tails iso using Kleopatra from the gpg4win download. Kleopatra opens but if I attempt a File/Decrypt Verify Files or attempt a File/New Certificate, Kleopatra terminates with the messsage "Kleopatra.exe has stopped working".

I have attempted to raise this on the gpg4win forum by creating a new user at http://wald.intevation.org,but I get the "This Connection is Untrusted Screen".

Windows Vista - Home Premium SP1
4 GB Ram
32 bit
Intel Quad CPU
55 gig freespace

Any ideas?
