>Can't an attacker get the password for my encrypted Persistent volume out of RAM while my machine is running, over the network?

Yes it is possible and has been carried out successfully in labs.

But the real question is: if the data you are working on is ultra-sensitive, why do you stay connected to the internet? You should first make sure there is no access to the internet, work on your ultra-sensitive data, once you are finished, re-established internet access.
