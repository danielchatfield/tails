>Your above statements show that Linux distros are just as vulnerable as Microsoft Windows OS.

That conculsion, regardless of its accuracy or lack thereof, simply does not follow from anything actually written in the post you were replying-to, \"comment 6\". 

*vulnerable* =/= *as vulnerable* 

As to the claim itself, I believe it all depends on what type of threats we are talking about.

*Common* malware and spyware, not directed at *specific entities*, is **far** less -- if at all-- a threat for GNU+Linux systems at the present time. That much is *empirical*. 

But if we are talking about threats *targeted* at **specific entities* from dedicated adversaries,  then the story is quite different.  For *these*,  the typical GNU+Linux system that has not been specifcally hardened against such threats may indeed be no more protected than its Windows or Mac counterpart. 

At least that's the impression I get and what I saw Brian Krebs state explicitly several years ago.
