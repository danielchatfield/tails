>As a rule, exploits take advantage of unpatched security vulnerabilties in applications, often \"extra\" software. These days software related to pdfs, flash, or browsing are often attacked. This is why you see warnings to avoid raising your attack profile by installing dozens of Firefox add-ons, \"eye candy\" Debian packages, and anything else whihc is probably not essential to using Tails.

Thanks, writer of comment 6.

When I was beginning to learn how to use Linux, many Linux users on forums laughed at me for asking what antivirus software I should use. Your above statements show that Linux distros are just as vulnerable as Microsoft Windows OS.
