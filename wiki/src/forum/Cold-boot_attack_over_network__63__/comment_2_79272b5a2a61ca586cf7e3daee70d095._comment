  When booting Tails from a USB stick and choosing the 'enable persistence' option, the password is entered. Then one could work on data in the encrypted persistent volume, with no internet connection. Then connect to the internet afterward. Now the password may still be in RAM.

  To avoid that, one would have to avoid connecting to the internet after enabling the persistence feature of the USB stick, then re-boot (and not enable persistence at re-boot) before going online.

  That would be  very inconvienient, as the purpose of persistence is to save documents from the internet. Hopefully there are other variables in the real-world internet environment that prevent the password being recovered from RAM outside a lab.
