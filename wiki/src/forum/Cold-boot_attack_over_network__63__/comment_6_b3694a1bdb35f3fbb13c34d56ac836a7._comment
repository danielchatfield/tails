@ Comment 5:

That is really a question about general computer security, especially of Debian derived distributions (Linux kernel plus operating system programs plus networking and all that other software everyone needs).

As a rule, exploits take advantage of unpatched security vulnerabilties in applications, often \"extra\" software.  These days software related to pdfs, flash, or browsing are often attacked.  This is why you see warnings to avoid raising your attack profile by installing dozens of Firefox add-ons, \"eye candy\" Debian packages, and anything else whihc is probably not essential to using Tails.
