Huh?

For *that*, it's fairly easy to simply save to *any* encrypted volume that can be decrypted and mounted within Tails (LUKS, TrueCrypt).

I thought that the main purpose of persistence is to be able save user customizations to the system itself: bookmarks, desktop/panel layout, preferences in the various programs that come with Tails (fonts in OpenOffice and gedit, etc.) , perhaps some added programs (those that are safe), etc.
