When I boot-up Tails, my system clock is set to a time that is *neither* my local time *nor* UTC. 

(The synch function does successfully set my clock to my local time but I don't understand why Tails defaults to this seemingly random time zone each and every time I boot.)  

Most of the many other live CDs I've tried default to UTC at boot. (And some may have even synched with the actual local time as set in my BIOS)

I also don't understand the need for synching to a user's *local* time in order to connect to Tor. Wouldn't defaulting to *UTC* afford greater anonymity? 

What about even allowing a user to *spoof* their time zone, i.e., use a different timezone than the one they are actually in?
