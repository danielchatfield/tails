>It also might help us if you tell us who your ISP is and which country you are in?

My ISP is SingTel and the country is Singapore.

If you are going to do research, can you also research the ISPs named below:

- SingTel http://www.singtel.com
- Starhub http://www.starhub.com
- M1 http://www.m1.com.sg

Slightly over a few months ago it was reported that one of FinFisher/FinSpy's server was located in Singapore.
