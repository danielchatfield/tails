Is there a way to remaster the ISO to CD size? 

I have difficuty in finding the source code for the distro, 
and some of applications in the ISO seems to be not very usfull for the purpose. For example, GIMP. LibreOffice . And the GUI seems to be heavy for the purpose as GNOME is not exactly the lightest around. 

There is any plans in  chnaging the GUI to LXDE or XFCE, which 
will enable the distro to run on older machine, which is more popular in developing countries where by people actually needs a anonymous distro.
