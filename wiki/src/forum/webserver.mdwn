Is it possible to add webserver and videostream function to the usb stick release?

I am planing to switch away from windows and i wane be prepared for any issues, like CME from the sun or EMP from a nuke or a fast switch to another machine.

especially away from hdd, windows and using only usb and ssd drives.
