LCD fonts look good.

obfsproxy seems to work fine also (both via Vidalia and torrc) - proxy servers can be picked up from the usual proxy webpage.

Quesion though - would not a normal encrypted Internet connection into the Tor network not do the same job - and if so then is there a ground for including OpenVPN, L2TP, etc. network manager plugins?
