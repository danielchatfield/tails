>Quesion though - would not a normal encrypted Internet connection into the Tor network not do the same job - and if so then is there a ground for including OpenVPN, L2TP, etc. network manager plugins?

Yes... but... isn't the risk\*difficulty/reward unfavourable?..

You'd have to set-up and maintain an appropriate proxy beyond the reach of your adversary, or find someone to do that for you. The Obfsproxy system attempts to provide that rather difficult necessity for the user.

You'd also have to bypass Tails' carefully enforced Tor use. That could create difficulty and confusion for the user and so create opportunity for disasters.

As presently configured, the Tails user with sufficient resources/expertise to do so could have a private/personal Obfsproxy bridge hosted out of reach of their adversary and easily and comparatively safely configure Tails to use that, should they wish.

Do you see any obvious advantage to your suggestion which I've overlooked?
