thanks for posting the checksums, it's obvious but you should still follow the string with the filename.

####what's of more value to me is this:

#####please post the output in sha1 and/or better with this command, after you have burned 0.14 and inserted the 0.14 DVD into the drive:

    sha1sum /dev/sr0

######then together we can compare checksums for *burnt* Tails 0.14 DVDs and make sure nothing 'funny' happened during the burning process!
