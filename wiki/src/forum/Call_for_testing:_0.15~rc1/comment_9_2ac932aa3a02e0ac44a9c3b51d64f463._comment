>No it isn't. That'd be no more trustworthy than the useless crap above.

That is not the issue in the request. You've said it a few times now, you posted your method, others have theirs. Move on.

>You can easily and securely verify your burned ISO yourself, without soliciting any input from anonymous strangers...

Isn't that what occurs on this forum? Q&A between anonymous strangers? Move on.

>Various methods have already been discussed on this forum.

I would like one or two people to post their checksum(s) for a burnt 0.14 DVD. It's easy enough to do and the instructions have been posted. If you don't like it, don't post. You don't appear to want or need the burnt DVD checksum. You've expressed your opinions. Move on.

>At this point I can be pretty certain that I have a verified Tails ISO... but ...just to confirm...

First, some people use burnering software without a verify option. Second, this checksum of a burnt 0.14 DVD is useful for a large number of people. If it's not for you, don't post about it. You have your method, fine, some have others, accept it and move on.

>No anonymous strangers required :D

Nice try! Tails is maintained by anonymous strangers and the forum is an exchange between anonymous strangers.

Or are you suggesting you know me personally and don't want this information exchanged between anonymous parties which would be helpful in confirming whether or not we have the same checksums for the 0.14 burned DVDs?

Now, will someone please post checksum(s) for a burnt 0.14 DVD? Thank you.
