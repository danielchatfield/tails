>what we need is one or two people to post the checksum result for the BURNED ISO result on DVDs, not post the same checksums for the unburnt iso file over and over.

No it isn't. That'd be no more trustworthy than the useless crap above.

You can easily and securely verify your burned ISO yourself, without soliciting any input from anonymous strangers...

Various methods have already been discussed on this forum. The one I use is:

* Properly verify the ISO

* Burn DVD with \"burn verification\" enabled

At this point I can be pretty certain that I have a verified *Tails* ISO... but ...just to confirm...

* Mount the newly burned DVD and the verified ISO file

* Run MD5deep on both

* Observe identical checksums

The content of my DVD **IS** the content of my **verified** Tails download.

No anonymous strangers required :D
