WOW! What an aggressive little idiot. Maybe frustration at your own inadequacy made you like this.

I'm sure you could learn to [verify](https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#authenticity-check) if you set your mind to it. What are you hoping to achieve by (mis)leading others to poorly verify their downloads? Some sense of unsafety in numbers? An experiment in \"social engineering\"?

All those hashes you've spammed all over this thread are practically worthless. They serve no useful purpose and prove nothing... except that you *still* \"don't get it\" but you'd already proven that.

Could show us all a little mercy and take your bad advice and bad attitude elsewhere? Somewhere you'd blend in a bit better? Have you tried somewhere like /. ?
