Which function forces the connection to the interwebs to finish through tor? I'd like to chian a socks5 proxy to tor, but in proxychains the connection goes 
tor<><>my proxy<><>tor timeout
I need to make it so it doesn't attempt to connect to tor after the proxy. does anyone know how to disable this?
