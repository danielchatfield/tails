op here. I have been testing it a little. When set to on demand, the cpu fluctutates between lowest setting 800mhz and the highest setting 1.6 ghz (there appears to be no middle ground). This is obviously bad and probably cause for the excessive heat.

on the same hardware,using a different debian based live OS with a 3.* kernel the ondemand behaves much better as it recognizes other possible states (1.0 and 1.3 ghz) and does not fluctuate such an erratic manner or so quickly.

My computer is a POS and I wasn't going to submit a report because it over heats in other OS's when plugged in too but my testing has shown that it suffers more with tails so I will submit one in the end/

thanks for the replies.
