ok last post. I've been looking more deeply and in actual fact there is no conservative option-

only powersave, ondemand or performance.

powersave = constant 800mhz
ondemand = mostly jumping quickly between 800mhz and 1.6ghz
performance = constant 1.6ghz

at 1.6ghz my computer is unable to decode 360p youtube videos which is pretty poor performance really. Maybe tails struggles with atom processors? More options - \"conservative\" or a constant 1.3 or 1.0 ghz would be useful though.
