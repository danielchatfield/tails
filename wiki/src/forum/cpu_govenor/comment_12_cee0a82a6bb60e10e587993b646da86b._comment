To start with, laptop-mode-tools is not only for spinning down hard-disks.

Thank you for submitting additional information; however, critical information is missing; with laptop-mode-tools disabled:

* what governor is set?
* if ondemand, does your CPU (in ondemand mode) scale to intermediary speeds such as 1.0 or 1.3 GHz?

And well, no, I don't think we'll add an applet to the panel to workaround this rare issue. Really, it should be *fixed*.
