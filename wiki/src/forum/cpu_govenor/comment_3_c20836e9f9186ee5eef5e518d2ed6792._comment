thanks for the replies. I do indeed have an atom processor and can now change the clock speed easily via \"add to panel\" - a simple solution indeed. I've not found the default on-demand setting to be very conservative though - my laptop gets very hot when it's running tails on ac power so I'm glad that I can now avoid it.
