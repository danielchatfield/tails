op again. Thanks for the information regarding desktops and amd processors but I don't see where you're going with that.

I can easily change to conservative thanks to the the advice in the 2nd reply. This much is obvious and causes no confusion.

If the default ondemand setting is still acting upredictably however that can still interest the tails devs. One of the replies above is a request for a bug report from them hence the continued discussion. As far as I am concerned though, the issue was instantly resolved.

thanks, but again I don't see your point.
