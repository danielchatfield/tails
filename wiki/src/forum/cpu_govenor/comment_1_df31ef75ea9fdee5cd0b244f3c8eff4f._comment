> is there anyway to easily and simply control clock speed when using a laptop or netbook in tails?

No such GUI out-of-the box, but Tails ships `laptop-mode-tools` which might help you achieve what you want.

On the other hand, if the default CPU speed management is not functionning properly for you, you may want to report this as a bug.
