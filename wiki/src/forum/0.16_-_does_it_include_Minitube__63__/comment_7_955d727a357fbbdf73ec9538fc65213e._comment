just wondering, has anyone looked at what google/youtube tries to do with a sniffer?  its beyond my level of computer knowledge but i was using minitube (in ubuntu and windows) because i hoped at least i was avoiding cookies and scripts and perhaps browser fingerprinting but would be interesting to hear what the experts have to say on the subject.
