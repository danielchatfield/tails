* \"Tor over VPN\" does not address the \"endnode to website\" issue. You still have to trust the endnode to be \"secure\"(VPN or Tor)
* Paid VPN makes it harder to be anonymous, you have to pay \"anonymous\" too
* Tor can create a \"chain\" of nodes, a VPN often has only one link
* VPN are often \"static\", with one fixed begin and endpoint. Tor can \"rotate\", reducing the chance a \"compromised\" endnode gather lengthy session traffic data
* If your VPN has your confidence, you likely not need Tor
