Hello,

First of all thanks a lot to the hard working and security loving developers for putting effort in this very useful distro.

As for this thread, I was wondering why you guys use debian live image as the boot splash screen.

Maybe something similar to this would work

along with Tails written on the image.

debian live written on the image doesn't do justice to Tails, and also people can get confused about the actual os they are booting :P
