>Could some entry nodes be attempting \"script kiddie\" attacks on Tails users?

Of course

>Since \"the West\" introduced a new series of \"three strikes\" anti-piracy laws and since the fast Akamai Tor nodes were introduced late last year, 

Nothing to do with anything (including the rest of this post) as far as I can tell but..

>I have noticed with much increased frequency something which in the past was quite rare, in my experience using both Tails and TBB under Debian stable.

Get on with it!

>I am concerned about connections to specific entry nodes (and even a handful of bridges) which appear to strongly prefer using specific combinations of ports, combinations which are associated with known \"script kiddie\" attacks.

Ah. This (and the rest of the post) is nonsense. Someone *probing* such port on your system could indicate an attempted penetration attack... but using those ports for other purposes would have **nothing** to do with that. E.G. If you re-use a port designated to RADIUS for FTP, then an attacker attempting to exploit a RADIUS vulnerability against that port will be frustrated because it will be ineffective against FTP! ...by using that port you wouldn't have magically turned your FTP service into RADIUS!

Re-using known (but unused on that particular Tor node) ports like this may actually be USEFUL to some Tor users!.. E.G. facilitating connections to the Tor network from behind heavy corporate firewalls which could block all ports other than those whitelisted because they are essential for boring corporate services - like the stuff you listed ;)
