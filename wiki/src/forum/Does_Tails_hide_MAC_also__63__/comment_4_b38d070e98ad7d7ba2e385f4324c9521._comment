> The links lead to interesting discussions. One question. Even if someone on our network can single out a MAC, they still cannot sniff (decrypt) the DNS and Internet traffic can they?

The DNS and the internet connections are routed through Tor, and so no, they can't get the content of your connection, unless they break the Tor encryption.

They will normally only see that your computer is communicating with a Tor node. Depending on your threat model, you may wan't to hide this, and so change your Mac adress and/or use Tor bridges.
