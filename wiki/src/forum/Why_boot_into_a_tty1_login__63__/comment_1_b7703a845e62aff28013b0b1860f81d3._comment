If everything goes right, Tails boots to a graphical user interface, not a tty. You may want to try adding combinations of the following to the kernel commandline (press TAB in language selection boot menu):

* nomodeset (if you have an ATI and Intel graphics card)
* nouveau.modeset=0 (if you have an NVIDIA graphics card)
* xorg-driver=vesa

Please report back with the results, and with which graphics cards you have.
