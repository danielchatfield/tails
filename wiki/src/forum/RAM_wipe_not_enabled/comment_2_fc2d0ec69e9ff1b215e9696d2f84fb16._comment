> For some reason my system no longer wipes RAM on shutdown. At the top it says on shutdown, 'Warning' across from 'Stopping memory wiping on live media removal'.

Please tell us:

1. how you are trying to shut down Tails
2. what's happening exactly
3. what makes you think RAM is not wiped.

Thanks!
