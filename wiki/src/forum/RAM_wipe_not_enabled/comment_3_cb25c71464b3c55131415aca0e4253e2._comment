I am using the most recent version of TAILS.  

I have shut down using both by using the power button in system and by pressing my notebook computer's power button with the same results.

I am assuming RAM is not being wiped because previously on shutdown I recall the system showing 'Wiping --------', while wiping.  It no longer does that.
