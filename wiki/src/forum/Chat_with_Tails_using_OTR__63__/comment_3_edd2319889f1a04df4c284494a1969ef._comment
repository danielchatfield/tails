Thanks for your patience.  I am still baffled but I do feel we are making progress, so please bear with me.

The problems I need to overcome are these:

* I wish to have a brief private anonymous conversation with some Tails developer and some Tor developer (on separate issues, never mind what)
* I want to have reasonable assurance that snoops cannot easily read the content of the chat, and also reasonable assurance that my location and identity will be hidden from snoops
* I have never used chat.  I have never used chat.  Did I say that I have never used chat?  I have no experience using chat.
* The Pidgin GUI is one of the worst I have seen in terms of suggesting to a newbie how to use the software.  The Pidgin GUI is awful.  Did I say that the Pidgin GUI is awful?  Because I think the Pidgin GUI is awful.

The issues which still baffle me are these:

* Assuming I have successfully started a private chat, am I supposed to type a sentence somewhere, hit return, and wait for a reply sentence to appear somewhere else?  (Sure, I think I can guess the answer to this at least, but... I've never used chat and I don't want to make a stupid mistake when trying to chat about a security-sensitive topic!)
* Both tutorials attempt to address \"getting started\" from the viewpoint of overcoming unnecessary technical obstacles arising from the awful Pidgin GUI, but do not address equally important socio-legal issues.
* Legal issue: what does it mean to register a chat account?  Does that imply some kind of business contract with some legal entity such as a network provider?  Does it mean agreeing to some \"privacy agreement\" saying that I have agreed to share my personal information with un-named \"business associates\" of Google, Facebook, etc?  I am expected to identity some payment method?  How could I possibly be anything close to anonymous, then?
* Turing issue: how can I avoid trying to initiate a chat with a bot?
* Social issue: given that I have never chatted with a Tails or Tor developer (or anyone), how can I be confident that such and such a username belongs to a Tails or Tor developer?  Does some Tails developer use the username tails in the chat room #tails?  Does Dan Kahn Gillmore (an example of a Tails developer, I think) use some handle in #tails and also use his GPG public key somehow to authenticate himself there?
* Social issue: if I have some idea what chat room to visit (#tor or #tails), how do I know what day and what time of day I am likely to find a developer present and accepting private chats from complete strangers?  
* Social issue: what is the accepted procedure for initiating a private conversation with a complete stranger, assuming I can presume we have a common interest (Tor or Tails)?  Yes, I might well want to have a second chat later and authenticate myself as the same anonymous individual as in the first chat using questions, and I assume that is something two parties arrange during their first chat, but how to initiate a private chat with a user whom I don't already know either in person or from previous chats?
* I assume that I can presume any Tails developer in #tails might expect complete strangers to request a private chat, not sure about Tor developers.

@ Comment 2:

Thanks for suggesting some indications that OTR is working; I now understand that I should look for \"private\" in one of those un-named Pidgin windows as an indication that the content of the chat is now encrypted.  (What cryptographic algorithm does OTR use, by the way?)

> Domain (jabber.org or jabber.no or jabber.ccc.de)

Is this something I can invent arbitrarily, or does this need to be a real domain?

From the first tutorial, it seems that I can try to use a preconfigured IRC account, but I wanted confirmation from \"Tails\" that it is OK to try to use that account in #tails or #tor.

> Generate a fingerprint (you use this to authenticate yourself over some other channel like email, gpg message on a forum, etc)

OK, I can see the value of the second maybe (does this forum allow encrypted posts whose sole purpose is to authenticate a Tails users to a Tails developer?) but not the first since I know of no feasible method of anonymous email.

But I still have no idea how to initiate a private chat with a total stranger, even assuming that I have some reason to presume that a Tor developer will accept a private chat from a total stranger under the assumption that said stranger desires to chat about Tor.
