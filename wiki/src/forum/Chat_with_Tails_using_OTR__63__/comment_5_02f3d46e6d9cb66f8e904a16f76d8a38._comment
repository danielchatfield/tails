Yep - gpg is the only way to send encrypted messages to all Tails developers. Their mailing list gpg private key is stored on the server and therefore a server compromise would reveal your messages. https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/openpgp_keys/index.en.html

If you want it more private you could gpg mail to a Tails developer directly. I don't know if they appreciate that but just try. Perhaps they do if you want to report something dangerous. You find (some) of their public keys in the debian keyring, you find them on Debian developer pages and on startpage.com.

You an use the Web of trust to authenticate the gpg public keys better. Web of trust - https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html

Or you can use whisperback but then they can't reply unless you include your gpg public key and an e-mail address. Whiperback is more for bug reports so forget about it.

Yep - Pidgin supports OTR for encryption. Use it to communicate with whoever you like. As I understand it's not meant to encrypt private chats on irc with Tails developers. The link to pidgin on the Help & Support button may create that impression I understand. The link to pidgin is not to tell you can use encryption to talk to Tails developers on irc but to tell there is a irc client in Tails. Hotlinking buzzwords doesn't always help. Documentation on this misunderstand please improve (you!).

As far I know Tails developers do not offer private encrypted (irc) chats. Maybe open a feature request and ask them to gpg sign their otr fingerprint?

As far I know the Tails developres do not offer support times or times where they are likely available.

. #tails looks like the kiss method. keep it stupid simple. You just connect and meet a few random people you can hardly authenticate. You can ask simple questions about Tails. Everyone can read it. Registration on irc network is not required. For example you could ask does Tails include a mail client and they answer and maybe give you the link to documentation. You have to be careful since evil people could claim to be Tails developers and talk you into doing something stupid.
