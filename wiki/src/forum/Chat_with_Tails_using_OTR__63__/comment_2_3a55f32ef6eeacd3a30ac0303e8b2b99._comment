I do not use Tails but Pidgin an OTR are quite simple on other platforms.

This will be written from the perspective that you are trying to use Jabber (XMPP) network but besides the act of setting up an account it does not really matter.

---Setting up a XMPP account---

Method 1

go to    Accounts-Manage Accounts-Add

Protocol (XMPP)
Username (whatever make sure it is unique, example- Anon34)
Domain (jabber.org or jabber.no or jabber.ccc.de)
Resource (leave it empty)
Password (unique passoword)
Remember password (I type it every time when I log in since Pidgin stores them in cleartext)
Local alias (Your name in the chat. If nothing is there you will be Anon34)
Create this new account on the server (This must be selected when making an account this way. If you have done it via method 2 then no need.)
Add

Method 2.
Check the website of servers (jabber. de, jabber.org, jabber. no, headcounter.org) since some offer the option to create the account on their site instead of withing Pidgin (method 1). Some servers do not support method 1. Jabber.no does so I recommend you use it.


Configuring OTR

Go to    Tools - Plugins - Off the Record Messaging and click Configure Plugin

Generate a fingerprint (you use this to authenticate yourself over some other channel like email, gpg message on a forum, etc)

Enable..
Automatically..
Require..
Dont log..
Show OTR button...

All the options should have a tick.


Talking with OTR

You double click on a buddy (that you have added through Add buddy) and select start private conversation in the top right corner of the chat window (where it says Not private)

 Attempting to start a private conversation with.....

(after a few seconds)

Unverified conversation with nicknamebuddy started.

Now you again click in the top right corner, where it says \"Unverified\" now. Select \"Authenticate buddy\". 

There you have three options. Fingeprint, shared secret, question and answer. To be secure you have exchange this info with your buddy beforehand through other secure  channels.

In case of fingerprint, you check if it matches the one you got from your other and click \"i have verified ..\"

Now it will say

 The privacy status of the current conversation is now: Private

Congratulations, you are now using OTR in all its glory ;)


Shitty formatting and typos I know but I hope this will help you. If not, ask away.
