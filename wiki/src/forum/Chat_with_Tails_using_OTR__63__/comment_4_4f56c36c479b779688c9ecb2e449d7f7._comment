Working from the back.

Talking with a stranger

you need to get his account ID (In case of jabber myusernamenick(at)jabber.org). You add him, he must accept, then you click him, click \"Start private\", and so on and so on (i have described the actual process in the first post).

Authentication can be done through numerous channels. Tails developer can, maybe did, publishly post his public key so when you check it you will know that you are talking to him. You can chat unecrypted and then exchange gpg signed messages with shared secret or fingerprint or secret question on pastebin.

Domain must run an XMPP server. Check the link below for server list. Accounts are free and do not usually need any real ID (facebook, real mail, etc).

OTR Protocol document
http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/Protocol-v2-3.1.0.html 

You need to decide which protoc√∂l will you use for communication. insructions for XMPP and IRC are different. OTR aplies to communication itself not the protocol per se and Pidgin is also a multi protocol software.

In the case of Tor and Tails developers I will assume it is IRC (not XMPP). Beware of the fact that OTR does not support channel chats so only private 1 to 1 chats can be included.

-Pidgin IRC OTR tutorial-

Account - Manage accounts - Add

Protocol - IRC
Username - RegisteredNick
Server - irc.oftc.net
Password - Password of the registred nick

Tab Advanced
Port: 6697
Tick \"Use SSl\"


server: 
port: 6697
chatroom: #tails
use TLS/SSL to connect



you will get \"User is not logged in\" if you are not registered but I am running out of online time here so I cant help you with IRC nick registration on irc. oftc. Google or wait for me to have some more time next week.

I cannot help you with questions relating to personal habits (when are they on, will the accept a chat from a stranger, their ID) of the said people. Trying Googling them.
