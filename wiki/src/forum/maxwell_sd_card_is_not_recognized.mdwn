hi, i just happens to find that a sd card inserted in a slot of my laptop is'nt recognized. As running in a vm my tails 0.11, (virtualbox) i wonder if this is due to tails or the vm or the card (wich is recognized in the debian host system)

i've tried several sd cards, brands, sizes, there is no change.

thanks for clarifying ?
