Talking about this for those who dont know it already:

1- Is this tool safe to use with tails (breaking anonymity) ?

2- There is a GUI for this tool which is here:

https://code.google.com/p/youtube-dl-gui/downloads/list

Its a zip file that's got Pythons in it. No instructions how to install the GUI. Can someone tell me how? Sorry I am still a beginner.
