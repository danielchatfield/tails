You are actually wrong on that one point.

.onion websites are servers that use TOR to connect their website directly to the TOR network, similarly to how normal users connect to it, the point of an exit node is that it is used to take data from the TOR network and connect it to the outside web, when you are using a .onion website that isn't a necessary step since the data never leaves the TOR network.

in other words when you connect to a .onion  domain the connection structure looks approximately like this:

You --> TOR Entry Node > middle Node > Another middle node > .onion server

there is no exit node involved since none is necessary and therefore you data obviously can't be sniffed by one either.
