> the 'Subject' line of emails sent via Tails w/Tor is still viewable by an attacker

Not always, depending upon how much access that attacker has to the relevant networks.  Some internal emails may never leave a private network.  But yes, in general once email leaves a mailserver for the internet at large, it is very hard to prevent snoops from having many opportunities to see that user \"bob@someco.co\" is communicating with \"alice@another.to\".

> can the filenames of files being downloaded from .onion websites also be seen?

Not just filenames, but content too, I would think.  If the server you are contacting uses http rather than https, data streams between that server and the Tor exit node are probably unencrypted.  I doubt that it matters whether the server is providing a hidden service (via the onion), but would welcome correction if I am wrong.
