@ comment 6

Yeah I realized while writing the comment that the connection structure was probably not 100% accurate and I didn't have time at the moment to look up the exact connection structure which is why I said that the connection structure looked *approximately* like the one I posted.

The main point of my comment wasn't really to give an exact diagram of how the connection worked though the main point was just that the connection didn't go through an exit server.

But thank you for the correction :)
