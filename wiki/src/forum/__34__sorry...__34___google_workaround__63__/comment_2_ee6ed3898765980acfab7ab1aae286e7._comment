While AOL may suck (for some), their search engine at aol.com, which says it's powered (or has some relation to) by Google, offers better results than most other non-Google search engines and it doesn't seem to take a dump like Google, Yahoo, Yandex, and some other search engines do when a lot of Tor users are active on them at the same time.
