@ OP:

Applications which attempt to guess how long you can run off your battery before you will need to recharge try to use some current readings *and a history of past readings* to make some educated guesses.  In my experience, they don't always work every well even for a laptop on which the operating system is a Linux booted from a hard drive (thus with persistence), but if you lack persistence (e.g. if you boot Tails from a live DVD), you probably shouldn't expect this kind of application to work reliably.
