Dear Sirs, 

This is very much needed.  Thank you very much for TAILS.  I do have a couple of questions.  

I am unable to get one of the computers I will be using this on to boot from USB.  It boots fine from DVD, and TAILS recognizes the USB drive.  Will it remain secure if I run live from a DVD and save files to the USB?  

Also, my hard drive shows up twice in “Computer”.  One of them says “reserved” (I think that's what it says) and one of them doesn't, what is the difference? 

When I right click on each of them I get the option to mount them.  I assume that means that they are not mounted, is that correct?  If I don't mount them, will that prevent anything I'm doing from getting onto the hard drive of the computer I am using?  

Thanks again
