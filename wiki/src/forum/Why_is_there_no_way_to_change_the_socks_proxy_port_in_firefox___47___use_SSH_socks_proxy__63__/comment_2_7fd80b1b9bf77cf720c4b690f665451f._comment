Hi

Thanks for your answer.

Yes, it isn't at all related to my anonymity, and I need to be able to use a 'clean and static IP' which this anonymous SSH socks proxy would provide.

BUT there is no way to change the socks port in the torbutton and that's weird as it isn't documented and I feel like that technically I _should_ be able to to that...

Anyway to bypass that restriction / anywhere where it's explained why this does exists?

It's strange it has been talked about a few times on this forum but never an answer from tails dev...
