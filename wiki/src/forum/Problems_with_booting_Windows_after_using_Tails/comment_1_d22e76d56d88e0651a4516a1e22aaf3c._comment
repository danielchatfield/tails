when booting TAILS, you often have to enable USB-Boot in the BIOS settings. Maybe you did that and accidently hit one of the power saving settings?

Either way, if you are not sure: resetting BIOS to custom settings, and/or looking for powermanagement features like silent mode, etc, would be my first choice.

Using Tails for quite a while now, never had this problem, works flawless here.
