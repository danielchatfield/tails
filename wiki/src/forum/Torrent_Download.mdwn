Hi,

For some reason, only openbittorrent tracker works in I2P.
udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce

The default tracker did not work in I2P:

- I2P 0.9.3 running under Windows 7

- QBittorrent 3.0.6 with proxy settings thru I2P

It did not work in I2PSnark either.

I am not sure there are any downsides for including an opentracker in the torrent, but I may be wrong.

If there are no major security downsides for this, can you please include open trackers like openbittorrent in the Tails torrent?

Thnx
