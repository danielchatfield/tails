Hi can you provide information on how to boot Tails 0.11 on a late 2011 Macbook Pro.

Seems the late models running OSX 10.7.3 (Not sure if that matters) are not compatible with rEFIt.

When trying to boot straight from Boot Camp Assistant I get a black screen and "Missing Operating System" Message.

Thanks.
