Okay ...

That, while not a perfect analogy, kind of seems like what you are suggesting. Of course, I didn't \"buy\" Tails - but the analogy is more \"right\" than \"wrong\" from this chair.

If you haven't deleted this yet: Couldn't one also argue that, since Tor works fine EVERY DAY from the same network, and your pre-configured  bootable OS does not (except very rarely), that maybe  it's not me or the network I'm on ... maybe you haven't taken every possible possibility into account when designing your excellent (I mean that sincerely) effort?

In any event, best of luck to you, too.
