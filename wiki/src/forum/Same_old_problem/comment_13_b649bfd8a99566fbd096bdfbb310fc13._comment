The Tails clock is set to UTC = GMT, so you probably live in timezone GMT-8.

Yes.

Not sure what's going on here (after reviewing your logs). Your Tor client is unable to reach the directory server for some reason. That would be normal if the network isn't working, but Tor generally detects and logs that with a \"NOROUTE\", which isn't in your log. Can you try pinging you router or some other host on your LAN from within Tails?

This would also happen if your ISP blocks access to Tor. Is Tor working if you use e.g. The Tor Browser on your main system?

> Would the clock sync fail is already caught in a man-in-the-milldle attack? IOW, could this be a way to detect MItM attacks? 

In some situations, yes, but definitely with false positives and false negatives. For instance, if the an invalid consensus is sent back to you as part of the MITM, then Tails would refuse to start Tor automatically on boot. But if the consensus is a replayed, valid consensus (that's no older than a week) Tails would happily accept it and probably manage to start Tor.

> There is some problem with the Tor consensus file, the times are off by ~6 hrs.

Note that the times in the consensus are UTC = GMT time. Or did you take this into account?
