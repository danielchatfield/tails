Hi. FYI the \"Download Bridges\" feature is not supported yet: this would require a firewall exception so that this outgoing connection goes in the clear (without Tor). This needs to be carefully thought through.

About the more general \"cannot connect to Tor\" problem: I'm very concerned about this issue, I hope one of us will be able to investigate it soon.
