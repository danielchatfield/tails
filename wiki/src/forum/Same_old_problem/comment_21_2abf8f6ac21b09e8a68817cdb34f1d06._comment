This rules out that it is a Tails specific issue. You may want to ask on the [tor-talk mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk/) how to further troubleshoot this. Perhaps someone there has some reliable method for verifying whether your ISP messes with Tor.

Good luck!
