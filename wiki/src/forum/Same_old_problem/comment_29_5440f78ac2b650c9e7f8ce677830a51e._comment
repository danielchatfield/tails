You previously said TBB didn't work either, so a better analogy might be:

> I bought a car from a dealer but the engine doesn't start in minus 60 degrees Celsius. The dealer told me to take it up with the engine's manufacturer.

It seems like there are external factors which cause your problems, be that your ISP blocking Tor, a faulty router/gateway/firewall in your LAN, or the Tor network misbehaving (although I haven't noticed any issues for the latter). If not, and this actually is a Tails issue, please post output of the following commands when this error occurs:

    cat /var/log/htpdate.log
    sudo grep time: /var/log/syslog
    sudo cat /var/log/tor/log

After you have saved these logs, do the following in the same Tails session:

    # manually set the system time to correct GMT/UTC time (look that up) by fixing the day, date and time in the following command:
    sudo date -s \"Wed Jan 11 18:00:00 UTC 2012\"
    sudo service tor restart

What happens? Tor working? Etc.
