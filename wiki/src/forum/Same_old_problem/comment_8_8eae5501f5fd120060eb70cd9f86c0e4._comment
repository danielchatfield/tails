> Vidalia still doesn't start sometimes

I've been facing this problem today for the first time.

The computer unfortunatelly freezed while I was pasting the log..

But in my case, the log said something like \"unable to write : not enough place on the device\". Indeed, my home folder was full.. shame one me..

So its a different problem as above, but it can be perhaps usefull for other people facing this to check the free space of your /home folder

Hope that helps.
