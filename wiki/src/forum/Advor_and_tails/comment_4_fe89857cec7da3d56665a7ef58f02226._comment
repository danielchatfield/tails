> how can one use this brilliant tor application Advor with tails instead of just the usual slow tor?

Firstly, AdvOR (previously known as AdvTor) is faster because it prefers using ultra-fast Tor relays, and that is also the reason why it's less secure than vanilla Tor. See [this post on tor-talk](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00026.html) for some more criticism by Nick Mathewson of Tor fame. Also, one of its main good features (some sort of transparent proxying solution) is already present in Tails.

Secondly, to actually answer your question, we do not support AdvOR in any way, so you'd have to install it yourself some how.
