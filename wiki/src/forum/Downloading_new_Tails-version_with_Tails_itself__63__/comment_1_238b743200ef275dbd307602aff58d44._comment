I would be surprised if \"Tails\" disagreed with one piece of advice: whatever else you do while using Tails (new or old), don't use torrents since this can

* de-anonymise you
* use too much bandwidth on the Tor network, to no purpose

Some have suggested using curl or wget.  If you don't torify these, you will connect directly to the server from which you are downloading the iso image.  I believe that Tails uses a round-robin to serve the latest iso images.  

If you do torify them, you might want to limit the bandwidth.

More generally, whenever you try to torify the downloading of GB sized files, this is likely to require circuits carrying so many packets that you may be de-anonymised anyway by some of our more sophisticated adversaries.  I'd like to hear what \"Tails\" has to say, however.  (We should expect to wait a day or so because I imagine the developers are taking a brief vacation since they just put out a new edition of Tails and deserve a break.)
