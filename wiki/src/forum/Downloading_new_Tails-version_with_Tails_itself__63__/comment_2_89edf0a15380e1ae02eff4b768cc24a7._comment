> anyway, is it ok to download with tor browser and then check the signature since the PGP-key is already in tails so i dont have to worry about a bad exit-node, right?

Yes. Check the signature. If it validates using the existing key, the download have not been tampered with by the exit-node or anyone else.

There is a small risk that the download cancels after a while before finishing. Since Tor Browsers resume support sucks, using curl is recommended. For example:

`curl -C - -O --socks5-hostname 127.0.0.1:9050 http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.17.2/tails-i386-0.17.2.iso`

> Some have suggested using curl or wget. If you don't torify these, you will connect directly to the server from which you are downloading the iso image.

From within Tails curl and wget is always going through the Tor network, or not at all, due to Tails firewall.
