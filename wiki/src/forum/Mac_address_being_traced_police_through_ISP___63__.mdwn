Just found out this information from someone who's senior tech person at Bell.

Canadian Police authorities have access to a database of their countries ISP databases and are able to find out who logged in with a specific MAC address to Tor. ISP gather MAC addresses now.

For example: If someone wanted to create a Facebook account, the logs at Facebook would include their MAC address, their IP address.

Then Police would go to that said database and enter that MAC address and see who logged in in Canada with that MAC Address (wether correct or fake -random address) to Tor. Then they would start their investigation from there. FUCK..did you guys knew that ?
