This is my first time installing tails onto a USB, I don't have CDs readily available, so I did the direct install to a USB. The install supposedly went without error, and I shut down and restarted my computer, booting from USB for the first time. After closing the setup screen, I received this message
"SYSLINUX 4.06 EDD 4.01-pre1 Copyright (C) 1994-2011 H. Peter Anuin et. al." 
with no options so proceed or exit etc. I left it for 10 minutes with no new developments so I rebooted from USB. I got the same message again, so I left the computer to do some work, around 2 or 3 hours, and came back, with no changes. 
I emailed the problem to support, obviously I couldn't use WhisperBack, but I'm submitting here just in case someone else had this problem and solved it on their own.
