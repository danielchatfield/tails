Was tails.boum.org down the last few days or was it just me? I used multiple ap's to see ping failures to tails site as well as having serious trouble sychronizing my clock for vidalia. My regular open net access on all 3 ap's worked flawlessly, just not tails, vidalia, and tor.

1. Welcome back!

2. Was anyone else experiencing these type of difficulties the last few days?

3. What is, will there be a work-around to sychronize the clock to allow vidalia to boostrap a tor circut?
