Hi,
okay, no problem because Your message.

But now I have run Tails with a DVD and everything was done like above :
Tor is connected.
Then
apt-get update and install remmina.

And I have the right login data entered from a note but rdp tells me it is unable to connect to server.
Is this Tails going to work out of the box with the RDP client or do I need to set anything else?
