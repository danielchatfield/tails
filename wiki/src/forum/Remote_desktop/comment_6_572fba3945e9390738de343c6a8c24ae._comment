Hi,
before I get my Tails running I tried the following:

Established Tor over vidalia on a Linux Mint KDE.
Checked in at the proxy setting for the KDE and set it to 127.0.0.1:9050
Went to Konqueror as this is a pure KDE app and tested with whatismyip.
It worked.
Then I went to KRDC, also a KDE app and wanted to connect over RDP to my Windows Desktop. Logged in, connected and got onto the Windows machine as usual.
Then I started the command shell in windows and typed in netstat -a which gave me the result that my normal IP adress still is available.

What am I doing wrong, or why did the IP still show up?

Cheers.
