Tails ensure that they will be no direct connections through the Internet between Tails and the server you are connecting to.

Remmina should use GNOME SOCKS proxy settings, so no extra configuration should be required.

> When i'm trying to install: \"sudo apt-get install remmina remmina-plugin-rdp\"

You were nearly there. Please try:

    sudo apt-get update
    sude apt-get install remmina remmina-plugin-rdp

(Content of Debian repositories needs to be refreshed on each boot.)

Please write some feedback if it works fine.
