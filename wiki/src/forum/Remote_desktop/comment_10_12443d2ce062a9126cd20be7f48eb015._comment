need to teel ??
I guess \"need to tunnel\". Right?

I have completely different problem obvisouly.
What is about ports on the router?

Because, when Tails is running and I look into the resolv.conf it says \"dont change anyting\" and it has nameserver 127.0.0.1 in there. What port is Tails using, when I want to get out? Standard TCP?

I mean, I tried to connect to server, okay, this didnt work. But I also tried to ping it over shell, which also didnt work. In the same network (same router settings) I pinged the windows server from another PC (actually a WinXP Pro) and it did work...
Also tried to ping any website from Tails, which also didnt work.
Why cant I ping?

When I cant ping, I dont need to wonder, why I cant RDP out? Right?
