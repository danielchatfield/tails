The panel encountered a problem while loading "OAFIID:GNOME_MixerApplet".

Do you want to delete the applet from your configuration?

A Google of what this could mean didn't help much.

Do I delete the applet, don't delete or just reboot? Or does it mean something significant?

If it helps, on first boot today, the boot failed and I had to Ctrl Alt Del to reboot. Then got the above error although everything else appears fine.
