Let me rephrase the question as I understand it:

> I want to download Tails 0.13 \"anonymously\" using TBB or a previous edition of Tails, but after reading <https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html> I am concerned about verifing that a copy of the iso image downloaded via Tor network has not been tampered with.

I am just another Tails user and this post contains the same information as the official Tails documentation, just rephrased to help you understand what to do.

As someone else said, both Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)

https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

and Tails 

<https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html>

use Tor and can assist you in downloading anonymously, and both provide cryptographic signatures with instructions on how to use them.  

Note that you need a working installation of GPG or PGP in order to verify signatures.  Tails comes with GPG (as do most Linux distributions) so it can be a good choice for anonymously downloading files you can request using your browser.

If you follow the correct procedures you can be confident that your copy of the Tails iso image and/or TBB \"tarball\" (or another GPG/PGP signed file) has not been tampered with.

To verify the Tails iso image, follow the instructions in

<https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#verify>

Notice that you need to download three files

* a PGP/GPG public key (the Tails signing key)
* a detached signature 
* the iso image itself

You need to import the GPG key into your GPG keyring and then you can verify the signature:

gpg --import keyfile

gpg --verify sigfile isofile
 
If you are using Tails on a USB stick with a persistent volume, and are keeping a personal GPG keyring in the persistent volume, containing useful keys like the Tails or TBB singing keys, it is a very good idea to keep your personal keyring in a strongly encrypted folder so that it cannot be read even by yourself except when you are actually using GPG.  Failure to secure keyrings is one of the most common mistakes of novice GPG/PGP users.

But for downloading/verifying the Tails iso image or another signed file anonymously, it is definitely not neccessary to use a Tails with a persistent volume, since importing the GPG key you need is almost instantaneous.

However, it is a good idea to also check the certificate of boum.org so that you can be confident you are connected to the genuine Tails website.  Same for torproject.org and note that the Tor Project says that there are some unauthorized websites which look just like torproject.org but are not, as you can verify by checking the certificates.  The unauthorized sites I know about do appear to be serving an unaltered copy of the TBB tarball, but the \"unauthorized mirrors\" (to use a gentle term) exist underlines the importance of verifying the website certificate.   After all, you are downloading all three files from a website and you want to make sure it's the right one.

In Iceweasel/Firefox, left click on the boum.org icon at the left of the location pane, then click on \"View Certificate\", \"Details\", and \"Subject\".  You should see that the certificate was issued by Gandi for boum.org.  Click on \"Not After\" to see the expiration date, 01/03/2013. Bonus points for verifying the serial number 

00:9B:B4:C2:40:40:5E:70:30:61:9D:CD:FF:20:B6:F1:90

and signature of the certificate too.
