thank you for the comments! I'll give it a shot this weekend.

I've just tested ubuntu 11.04 with a live usb, and the touchscreen works out of the box. Although I'm not sure if that means that the driver is free? I guess I can't just see what driver is used, and extract those files from the ubuntu iso and add them to the Tails-iso?
