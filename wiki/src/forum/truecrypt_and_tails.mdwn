So i downloaded and installed tails as the directions instructed onto a 4gb usb drive. My system is fully encrypted using truecrypt and when I went and modified the bios boot order to boot tails I got as far as language select before the screen turned grey with an unchanging underscore in the top left. I suspect the reason it won't proceed further than this is because it can't interact with my system due to truecrypt. Does anyone have any solutions? I'm considering running tails in a virtual machine but I know that would screw some security.
