I agree with those who say javascript (and anything else that can run off a website) should be disabled by default whether that is with NoScript or whatever.  That is the only sane option.

Sites that want javascript enabled usually throw a message about it, don't they? Allow users to enable javascript but throw a warning dialog if they try. 

Meanwhile, users should open the browser settings as disable Javascript as soon as they boot Tails.
