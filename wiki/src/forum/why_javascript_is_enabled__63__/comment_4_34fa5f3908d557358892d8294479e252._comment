Your assumption is wrong, see [[contribute/design]].
There's a balance to find between security/privacy/anonymity and *usability*.
\"More protective\" is not *by principle* better for Tails users.
You may want to [[read more about Tails|about]] before having any other such expectation about it.

However, you may be happy to [[learn|todo/iceweasel addon - NoScript]] that the next Tails major version is likely to ship NoScript. Turning off JavaScript will then be a two-click task for those who want/need this.
