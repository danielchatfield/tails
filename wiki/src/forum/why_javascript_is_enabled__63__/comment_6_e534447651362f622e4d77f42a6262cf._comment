what additions would you make to a custom kernel? can you give an example of an alternative project currently under development that meets your criteria (or at least more so than tails)? Could you at least provide some constructive criticism, suggestions or concrete examples?

I have nothing to do with this project and while I find your perspective interesting and valuable in itself, I don't feel that you're actually adding anything to the discussion here. Perhaps you could elaborate..
