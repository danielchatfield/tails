I still believe that the default state for JavaScript should be Disabled instead of being enabled by default. The whole idea (please correct me if I am wrong in my assumption) behind Tails and similar products is to be protective of it's users to the maximum degree. Anyone using Tails should have a reasonable expectation of such a protection. I, for one, had such expectation. I was very disappointed and unpleasantly surprised to see JavaScript being enabled by default. 

I think it is better to leave it to the user to enable it if a user wants so than having it enabled by default in a product that proclaims to be \"...incognito live system\".
