I'm certainly not claiming this is impossible. However, this potential damage
must be compared to the known, certain damage that would be done if we disabled
JavaScript by default: many users would think their preferred websites \"do not
work in Tails\", and would go back to browsing it in a less safe way. Hence the current situation.
