In a recent related thread I suggested that there is probably no way of obtaining a \"trusted\" system on which to burn/use a \"trusted\" Tails bootable DVD or make a \"trusted\" Tails bootable USB stick, but one can try to bootstrap to \"more trusted\" system and a \"more trusted\" Tails.  

I suggested that Windows users consider dumping Windows for Debian stable (the Linux distribution on which Tails is based).

The Debian stable installation DVD does have a self-check which should help guard against bit errors if you are downloading over a noisy channel.  More important, the iso images have GPG signed files which list two or more cryptographic hashes for each iso image.  Probably the only one you really need is CD #1 iso, or the installation DVD iso, or the netinstall iso.  If you can obtain and verify those, the rest of Debian stable installation should proceed via Internet and the apt-get installer should automatically check the cryptographic signature (not just a hash) for each downloaded package.

Yes, this process can probably be subverted, and it is known that our more capable adversaries do try hard to disguise malware within legitimate software installs/upgrades, but it is better than anything else I know. 

And you can follow such procedures with several other live CD/DVD distributions which offer forensic tools you can use to cross check.  For example, especially if you have two computers available, you can probably use rkhunter on one to check the system on the other for some formerly common Linux rootkits.  I've never heard of anyone finding anything suspicious this way (and rkhunter can give some false positives, so ask here if you think you found something), and the most dangerous threats are not addressed by rkhunter, but... possibly better than nothing.

Generally, using Debian over time may lead to increased confidence that you stand a chance of spotting signs that something bad is happening.  The idea here is to investigate things you don't understand, and keep revisiting old issues as you learn more.  This can be quite time consuming (I often spend more time than I care to think about chasing down issues only to eventually conclude that the apparent \"security issue\" was a \"non-issue\").

Again, if you look at this problem as working your way from insecurity towards better security rather than as seeking the Holy Grail of \"perfect security\", fending off our adversaries seems less daunting.
