>Allow me to share a vision in my limited expert's mind's eye. The solution seems kinda obvious - create a checksum of the objects to verify (the entire distro image or just critical parts ?),..

Perfectly valid integrity checking procedure: md5deep (or whirlpooldeep if you're exceptionally paranoid) are perfect for this. Of course it would have to be done from a trusted system - not the one you're testing!.. The live DVD from which the stick was created being the obvious candidate... with the initial \"trusted\" checksum being generated immediately upon completion of the installation to the stick. Whether there's any point at all to any of this however is questionable... (see caveat)

>...keep the checksum separate from the media carrying Tails. Perhaps the checksum could, and indeed needs to be converted into a human-memorable form ( akin to Brain Wallet solution for BitCoin only in reverse ), kept in the memory of the human user ( or at least on a separate from Tails media )...

Far too much data for that to be practicable. Write the digest down or save to worm media then keep it safe ;-) 

>...applied either everytime Tails boots ( as a second passfraze )...

Absolutely no point attempting this from within the untrusted system. Probably little point otherwise (see caveat)

>...whenever the user feels the need. 

Yup... this could be done from the (trusted: (i.e. properly verified) installation DVD **on a trusted machine**) 

>The second seemingly obvious solution is to encrypt the entire USB drive as I believe TrueCrypt and LUKS allow , which again as my limited expertise suggests would preclude successful modification of the USB content by an adversary.

Nope... \"whole disk encryption\" is a myth. The malicious payload would simply have to be incorporated into the bootloader (which **obviously** won't be encrypted) rather than whatever other Tails file(s) it might have been implanted into.

>As for the solution offered in comment 3 , it seems the realistic version of it would be to reinstall Tails afresh after every instance of the installation media getting in the hands of the adversary ( border crossing etc. ).

Quite. This only addresses *software* though, while comment 3 wandered off into another altogether more troublesome minefield. Hence caveat! 

OP was specific to *the USB medium* so the solution to OP is extremely simple... DON'T trust it!... If *the man* has been messing with your stick, wipe it clean or replace it, then reinstall from a trusted source. \"Problem\" solved.

One will, of course, have (at least one) copy of the signing key somewhere safe, probably a copy or two of the key's \"long fingerprint\" jotted down longhand and kept safe too, so trust in Tails hasn't been compromised. All that needs be done is finding a trustworthy machine (see caveat) from which to re-download/re-verify/re-install.

**Caveat:** Thanks to PKI, verifying the *software* is piss-easy... the **difficult** part of all this \"*how do I trust my gear after I've left it unattended and unsecured?*\" theory is how to establish and maintain trust in the **hardware**. If you're leaving your machine unattended then a *firmware* or *hardware* attack would be much more robust/rewarding than some mickey mouse *software* caper. So:

* If you're leaving your **hardware** unsecured when unattended and not checking thoroughly for *hardware/firmware* attacks every time, then isn't fussing about *software* somewhat pointless?

* If you do keep your *hardware* secure, then keep a trustworthy OS on it and use it for verification/authentication platform!

>Critique at will.

How's that for a start? ;o)
