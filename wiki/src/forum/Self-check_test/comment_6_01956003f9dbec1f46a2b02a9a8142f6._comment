So we are back to square one then. Basically it's all about having a trusted back up - both hardware and software, with which to check the suspected ones.
  While we're at it , a paranoid scenario , which really is not all that unrealistic given the resources at the disposal of large entities such as the US Gov: through previous investigative work THEY have established exact model of the hardware used by their target; having gotten the hardware into custody ( via artificially created pretext or when the target gives an opportunity , e.g. passing through Gov. checkpoint ) they, instead of installing a removable keylogger, replace the entire motherboard of the target's laptop with a modified one with the spyware built in so that even a visual inspection upon disassembly won't reveal anything out of the ordinary to the target. Now what? Dispose of the hardware after every suspicious incident?
