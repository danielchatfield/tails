Greetings,

First of all I have been in IT for a billion years, but for the most part its all been windows sysadmin and security. As for linux, I'm dangerous with my knowledge at best.

I have purchased a Google/Samsung ChromeBOX - which is the desktop version of their chromebook... Out of the box it only ran ChromeOS and I have no love for google tracking my every move - so I immediately switched it to developer mode and did the things necessary to get Ubuntu installed.. Everything worked great.

This machine is fairly standard PC architecture... i5 processor, 4gigs of ram, very nice display card, and dual outputs for monitors - along with sound/mic, wifi and bluetooth. I got the hardware for $225 which I thought was amazing. People are saying the unit will support 16gb of ram.

Here is where my post comes in though... I *really* want to run non-persistent TAILS booted from a USB on this guy. I tried the standard way of building and writing the USB drive using uNetBootin, or Universal USB installer and neither worked. Leaving me wondering if the Chrome BIOS is looking for a different partition type when it scans for USB's on boot.

I just wanted to know if anyone here has done any work with this or would be interested in helping me get through this problem.. In the end I could care less if I ever run anything on the SSD again. I would be completely fine just booting tails from the USB.

Thanks for any and all help.
