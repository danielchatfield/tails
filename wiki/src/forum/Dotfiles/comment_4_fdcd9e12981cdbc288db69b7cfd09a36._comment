[I opened the thread]
Yes, I know that files and folders starting with dots are hidden, but the \"hidden\" folder of my home directory are not saved upon reboot, there is this Dotfile option in persistence that for sure is made to achieve this function but I just can't figure out how it works!
I'll make an example: if you save a gtk theme in the \".themes\" folder in your home directory, after the reboot it's no more there (as expected). If you select the Dotfiles option in persistence configuration it's not making that folder persistent after a reboot and in fact this option shuoldn't: in the description it's decribed how it should really work, there is a \"dotfiles\" folder containing some folder/files and, after a reboot, persistence should symlink each of these files/folder in your home directory. The problem is: where is this dotfiles folder? Should I create this folder? If yes, where?

For now I made a script making all this for me but I have to manually launch it after each boot, waiting for solution.
