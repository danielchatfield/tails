> Done, I found it (maybe in Tails contribute/design documentation, I cant't remember how to get there, it's anyway not really user-friendly hiding useful documentation xD) the folder is in /live/persistent/xxx_unlocked/dotfiles
> I think it should be written in the documentation!

Hiding (or omitting, rather) that information was not intentional. The [[dotfiles documentation|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#index9h2]] has been updated now. I hope it's usage is clear now, but bear in mind that this is sort of an expert feature.

> Do I just need to copy the file that I wish to be persistent into this folder, with no form of path or anything? Eg /Live/.../dotfiles/file

That depends on what you want to achieve. In your example a link to `/live/.../dotfiles/file` would appear in you home directory root. 

> Or do I need to also create a directory structure to represent the one found in /home/amnesia? eg. /home/anesia/.mozilla/file needs to be copied to /Live/..../dotfiles/.mozilla/file?

In your example a link `/home/amnesia/.mozilla/file` will created, linking to `/live/.../dotfiles/.mozilla/file`.
