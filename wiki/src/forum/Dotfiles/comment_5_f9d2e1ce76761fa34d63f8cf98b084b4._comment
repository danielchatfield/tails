[Again it's me, I opened the thread]

I have got something:
https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/persistence/#index2h4
\"by default setup, setup a linkfiles-enabled persistent ${HOME}/dotfiles, preconfigured to have its contents symlinked into $HOME.\"

I have tryied and nothing, it seems not to work :( Maybe some of the Tails developers can help, is this function implemented?
