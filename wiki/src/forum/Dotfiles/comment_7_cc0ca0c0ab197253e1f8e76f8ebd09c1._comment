I understand that dotfile is a persistent folder obscurely accessed via /live/....

Do I just need to copy the file that I wish to be persistent into this folder, with no form of path or anything? Eg /Live/.../dotfiles/*file*

Or do I need to also create a directory structure to represent the one found in /home/amnesia? eg. /home/anesia/.mozilla/*file* needs to be copied to /Live/..../dotfiles/.mozilla/*file*?

Or am I completely on the wrong track?

please explain further.
