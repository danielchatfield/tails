Thank you for your clarifications! 

After comment number 8... it still doean't work.

I am created:

/live/persistent/sdb2_unlocked/dotfiles/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml

that (after reboot) autmatically copies itself to:

/home/amnesia/.gconf/desktop/gnome/background/%gconf.xml

(I know that copying works because of the arrow on the icon of %gconf.xml)

but... the desktop background image doesn't show up on my desktop (the desktop remaind plain blue - as usual in Tails).
