>What possible motivation, other than voyeurism, could there be for wasting your bandwith on allowing complete strangers to use your network collection for all manner of potentially illegal activity?

Because they aren't afraid of being harrassed or investigated because they aren't doing anything illegal? Some people have these crazy nostalgic ideas about the US Constitution, free speech, the right to privacy unless there is probable cause. People donate money without expecting anything in return. Some people risk their LIVES fighting for the liberation of their nation. Wouldn't it be easier to obey or run away? Who is really happier, the lap dog who kisses ass for a living? The rebel who learns to live in opposition or dies trying? ...or the comfortable Tor user who bothers to push the big red button and finds that nothing much happens.
