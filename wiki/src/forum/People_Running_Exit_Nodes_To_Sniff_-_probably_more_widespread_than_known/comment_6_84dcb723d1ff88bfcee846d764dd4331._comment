I wrote comment 4 in which I said 

\"Thought provoking stuff, certainly, but not in my view good reason for human rights activists, civil liberties advocates, or just plain folks hoping to evade Google's profiling, to use Tor.\"  

I meant to write 

\"Thought provoking stuff, certainly, but not in my view good reason for human rights activists, civil liberties advocates, or just plain folks hoping to evade Google's profiling, to stop using Tor.\"

More briefly: pay attention, especially to general computer security issues which Tor does not attempt to address, but by all means use Tor for all your web-browsing.  I find this is no slower than un-torified web-browsing and probably much more resistant to profiling by your ISP, Google and friends (maybe even the \"friends\" whose unofficial motto seems to be \"we are in the business of being up in everybodies business\", the ones known by three letter acronyms).

@ the previous commentator: if you mean me, I referred to Google.  I am not sure I know what you mean by \"stalker\", much less whether the situation you have in mind is something Tor could help mitigate.
