Concerning the quoted comment: \"What's just awful though is that they don't seem to be browsing anything that's the least bit sensitive.\"

I'd like to hear a comment from the Tails developers on the following proposition: far from being \"awful\", when people use Tor (maybe running under Tails) for innocuous web-browsing, this is generally helpful to political activists or human rights workers using it for possibly \"dangerous\" web activity inside the territory of oppressive governments, because it can possibly make it harder to identify/track the activity of people who may be targeted by agencies who plan to arrest and torture them.

I think that all experienced Tor users who read the news are aware that Tor nodes are sometimes operated by researchers whose intentions may or may not be pure.  

One of the more interesting applications of \"scary\" research which I think actually served the public interest was the security researcher who ran some nodes for several months and sniffed packets containing things like cleartext passwords used by Iranian diplomats logging into their embassy networks from home.  He conjectured that Tor had been tolerated by US authorities because of its role in an intelligence collection effort targeting such obvious targets of US intelligence agencies as Iranian diplomats.  And his home was promptly raided by the (pro-\"Western\") authorities, and he was threatened with very serious charges.  The charges were later dropped, and his computers were returned, but he stated that he would not perform further such research because the consequences had been more dire than he had anticipated.  That kind of reaction certainly does tend to suggest that his conjecture was not completely off target.  

There is also a sociologist in Portugal who runs some Tor nodes, and who has published some papers on his \"research\".  In my opinion his results are not very interesting and do not justify the invasion of privacy.  Then there is the fellow who is famous for once taking over the internet, and who is not making any attempt to hide the fact that he is currently operating a fast Tor node which grabs a lot of Tor traffic.  And there are some other Tor nodes I am aware of which seem to be operated for the purpose of sniffing Tor traffic for sometimes questionable sociological or security \"research\".

Anyone interested in security researchers and sociologists using \"rogue\" nodes to sniff Tor traffic can search for academic papers based upon the result of such research.

There are also certain sub-networks of Tor routers which are known to be operated by companies which are involved in anti-piracy efforts, privatized espionage, and large ISPs apparently trying to spot check on what Tor users are doing over their wires (or possibly, complying with warrantless demands to track specific Tor users).  (Any Tor user who is surprised by this must not be reading sources such as Techdirt!)

Thought provoking stuff, certainly, but not in my view good reason for human rights activists, civil liberties advocates, or just plain folks hoping to evade Google's profiling, to use Tor.  The fact that anyone can set up a Tor node is both a great strength and a weakness of Tor.  The best cure for rogue nodes is almost certainly encouraging more people to run Tor nodes (at least for entry nodes and middle hops)--- something which the Tor Browser Bundle makes easy; just make sure you download the latest version from torproject.org and verify the detached signature using Erinn Clark's signing key.

In general, I support the free discussion of suspect Tor nodes because I think that on balance a well-informed discussion will persuade most Tor users that while some entities do indeed to be operating Tor nodes for nasty purposes, this is not by itself sufficient reason to stop using Tor, ESPECIALLY if (like most of us) you are using Tor mostly to evade profiling by Google, your ISP, etc.

@ Comment 1: you wrote \"And this just goes to show that if a ZOKLET member can gather all your details, the government sure as hell can.\"  I agree that possible surveillance of our Tor traffic by governments and their corporate partners (\"surveillance as a service\" is a rapidly growing multinational industry) is a legitimate concern, particularly if you live in certain countries where accessing some of the internet is illegal.  

But I don't think anything has been said here which should frighten anyone away from using Tor.  A lot of smart people have worked hard to make things very difficult for adversary organizations targeting individual web users, and I've read quite a few leaked documents suggesting that even sophisticated adversaries find it difficult to track Tor users, provided they use Tor properly and try to maintain a secure computer generally.

@ Comment 2: are you saying that sysadmins who run a Tor node on their company network in order to sniff unencrypted Tor traffic, out of curiosity, are placing their company at legal risk?  Depending upon where one the servers are located, that could be true in principle, but I suspect not in practice.

@ Comment 3: as they say at Wikipedia: be bold.  When enough people are bold, autocracies tremble.
