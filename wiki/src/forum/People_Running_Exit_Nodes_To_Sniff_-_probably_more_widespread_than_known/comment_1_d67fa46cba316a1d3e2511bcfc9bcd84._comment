>Lol. 99% of that shit isnt sensitive in any way, shape or form. And this just goes to show that if a ZOKLET member can gather all your details, the government sure as hell can.

>Heh, hypotheticly, if someone were to want REAL juicy stuff from tor, youd open up an exit node, sey up ssl strip and then set your sniffer

>Regardless of what you get from exit nodes, the real fun comes from user profiling once you've collected enough data. You may not be able to tell the names of the people, but based on timing alone, you can figure out the different users on your node.

>No such thing as net anonymity. The only thing you can do is increase the amount of time it takes for you to get caught.

>From what I've read, Tor uses volunteer nodes. Who runs them? Probably carders or agencies. lol
