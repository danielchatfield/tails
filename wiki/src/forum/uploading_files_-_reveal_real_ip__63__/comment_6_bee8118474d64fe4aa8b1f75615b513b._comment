thank you to commenter 1 and Tails

I started this thread and later on someone vandalized it and posted spam. Did someone hack the forum?? how can someone access a starting post and edit it, unless maybe someone in the moderators with privileges wanted to make a silly joke

for topic what I had in mind is something like when you send a file over a chat-app to one of your contacts online, a direct connection (p2p) is used for transfer. That is as opposed to normal chatting where your contact only knows the ip of the chat server that connects you together.

My question is based on that scenario but with the difference that you are uploading a file to site. I now have a better understanding of how this works due to participants info, so thank you again.

I am still wondering though, what actually happened to this thread??
