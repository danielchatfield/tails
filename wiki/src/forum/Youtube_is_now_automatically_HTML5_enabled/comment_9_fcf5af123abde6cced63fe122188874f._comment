>    If you want to find videos with WebM formats available, you can use the Advanced Search options to look for them (or just add &webm=1 to any search URL)

>Supported Browsers

>We support browsers that support both the video tag in HTML5 and either the h.264 video codec or the WebM format (with VP8 codec). These include:

>    Firefox 4 (WebM, Available here)
    Google Chrome (WebM)
    Opera 10.6+ (WebM, Available here)
    Apple Safari (h.264, version 4+)
    Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 (h.264, Available here, WebM support avaliable here)
    Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8 with Google Chrome Frame installed (Get Google Chrome Frame)

>Notes

>Additional Restrictions (we are working on these!)

>    Videos with ads are not supported (they will play in the Flash player)
    On Firefox and Opera, only videos with WebM transcodes will play in HTML5
    If you've opted in to other testtube experiments, you may not get the HTML5 player (Feather is supported, though)
