That sounds like a major security hole. Better to make anything like Flash or video show an icon indicating that you must click to play (like NoScript or FlashBlock does). YouTube already requires us to click an arrow to play embedded videos on other sites so this should be obvious to end users. I can't wait to see all the new ways they will be trying to molest us with ads and tracking using HTML5. 

It seems that webm is the HTML5 format that Google/YouTube uses. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video#Google_purchase_of_On2>

>Youtube is now automatically HTML5 enabled

Not sure what that means but I find that maybe less than 10% of YouTube videos are available in webm format and the only way I know to see if a video is webm is to load the page for every video. Who would bother using YouTube when 90% of your clicking fails to load a video? Is YouTube planning to add webm format to all their videos or is this just for new uploads?
