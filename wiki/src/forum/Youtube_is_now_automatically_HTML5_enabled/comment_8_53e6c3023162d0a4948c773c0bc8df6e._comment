I tried this with Tails and most won't play. A few play but are choppy. HTML5 is as insecure as Flash IMO.

Minitube and youtube-dl are not working for me in Ubuntu 12.04. 

I am looking for an open-source alternative to Video DownloadHelper such as a Firefox plugin that can download the mobile format (3gp). It would be better than DownloadHelper if it could also download more videos in webm (like Chromium can play) or h264.
