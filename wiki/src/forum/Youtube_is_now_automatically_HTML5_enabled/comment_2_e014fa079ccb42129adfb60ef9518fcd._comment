The best part is, we can now watch the *embedded Youtube videos* too.

It's looking for a Flash Player or an *HTML5 Browser*. After configuring NoScript both youtube.com and both the embedded youtube videos elsewhere can easily be watched.

Tails and Tor Browser Bundle both should configure Noscript to unblock Youtube. Please contact the people at the Tor Project. They were discussing how to opt-in Youtube HTML5 permanently:

Youtube did it for us.
