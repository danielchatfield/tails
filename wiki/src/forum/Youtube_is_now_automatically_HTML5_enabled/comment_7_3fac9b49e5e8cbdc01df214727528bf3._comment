>>Youtube is now automatically HTML5 enabled

>Not sure what that means but I find that maybe less than 10% of YouTube videos are available in webm format and the only way I know to see if a video is webm is to load the page for every video.

Correction time again. When I viewed the available formats with *Video DownloadHelper* I didn't see the webm format available for most videos but later I browsed YouTube with Chromium and videos that didn't show the webm format with DownloadHelper, do play in Chromium in HTML5 format. You can see if it is Flash or HTML5 by right-clicking the video.
