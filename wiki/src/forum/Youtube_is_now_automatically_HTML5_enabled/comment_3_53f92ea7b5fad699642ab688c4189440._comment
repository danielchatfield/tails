Reconfiguring Noscript is not an option but is a must.

Noscript blocks embedded videos and temporarily allowing the video leads to refreshing the embed video and after pressing play button it's blocked again. Again and again...

Tried it in Tor Browser, it didn't refresh the embed video automatically, but after manually refreshing the page I could only then watch that video.
