I downloaded TAILS to my 16gb usb stick and everything works fine when I boot up from it. When I use my computer normally i.e. regular boot up and put in the TAILS usb, my computer can't find it. Is there any way I can have my computer find and open that usb so I can utilize the free disk space?Thanks
