so I just went to turn off my Tails, and I get this:

Loading new kernel image into memory...[    837.552291] System halted.

Its just stayed like that for 20 minutes now. What do I do? Should I turn off the computer? I don't want to corrupt or lose anything..I also can't seem to input anything either.

Please I need help urgently!
