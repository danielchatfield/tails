You can read all about the current persistence in [the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)

You can also read about the plans for enhancing Tails' persistance on the appropriate \"todo\" page which can be found under \"[contribute](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/index.en.html)\"

I can't tell you any more as I have no intention of ever using it myself.
