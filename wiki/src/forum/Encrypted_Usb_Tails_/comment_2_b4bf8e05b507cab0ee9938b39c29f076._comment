Building on comment 1: If we shipped a method for how to do this, chances are that we would be the only live distro using it, so your adversary could reasonably assume it was Tails any way. So we have two options:

0. Use a method that will look like something commonly used in other live distros.
0. It's up to all Tails users to invent their own method of setting this up.

At this stage the latter option is the only reasonable choice.
