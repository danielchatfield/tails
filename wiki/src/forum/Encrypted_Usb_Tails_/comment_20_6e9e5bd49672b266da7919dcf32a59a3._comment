To replace some of the functionality you have with persistent volumes:

1. Download [remastersys](http://www.remastersys.com/)
2. Tweak your files and configure tails to your liking
3. Make a system backup to an iso file using remastersys
4. Sign the iso with pgp

Now you can boot the iso from USB/CD as detailed in the above posts, and get all your persolalized files!

Updating your iso without losing all your personalizations is a bit tricky. This is how I do it:

1. Boot the old iso in a Virtual Machine
2. Insert the USB
3. Create a USB install from the old iso (Clone&Install in Tails USB Installer)
4. Then  choose the new iso and Clone&Upgrade the USB install
5. Boot the updated USB Install and use remastersys to generate the new iso
