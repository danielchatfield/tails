Since Tails 0.11 it has (unfortunately) become necessary to invoke the \"greeter\" if root access will be needed. i.e. for mounting internal disks, running Network Manager, etc.

To disable the automatic login and thereby inflict the greeter on oneself, add **nox11autologin** to the boot command.



>**RE: RE: Why \"install\" tails at all?**

Sorry, I hadn't seen this.

>can you please explain step by step for a beginner, how you do it on linux bash?

The only thing I can think you might need to do from a command prompt is install Grub2 - if it isn't already on the stick. Get the partitioning and formatting of the stick as you'd like it then install Grub2 onto the *unmounted* stick thus:

    mkdir /media/usbSetup
    mount /dev/sdxn /media/usbSetup
    grub-install --no-floppy --root-directory=/media/usbSetup /dev/sdx
    umount /media/usbSetup
    rm -r  /media/usbSetup

**N.B.** In the above:

* All commands must be executed as root. Therefore you may need to prefix each line with **sudo**.

* On line 2: **/dev/sdxn** is a placeholder for the path on *your* system to the *partition* on *your USB stick* onto which *you* want to install the Grub2 files. Obviously I *can't* know which device it'll be so you'll have to replace it with whatever is relevant to your hardware. e.g. */dev/sdb1* - You can use **fdisk -l** (terminal) or gparted (Gnome GUI) to examine your disks and determine the correct path. Be SURE you get this path CORRECT! ;-)

* On line 3: **/dev/sdx** is another placeholder; for the path on *your* system to the *USB stick* onto which you want to install Grub2. It'll be the same as the partition path you used above but with the number omitted from the end. e.g. */dev/sdb*

* Be sure the **umount** command was successful (no errors) before you remove the temporary folder (**rm -r  /media/usbSetup**) or you'll erase your Grub2 files and have to install it again.

If you're not sure what environment to install Grub2 from, I'd recommend [System Rescue CD v2.8.1](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/systemrescuecd/systemrescuecd-x86-2.8.1.iso) as it's the first (and so far only) distro to include Grub2 version 2.00

If you need more detailed instructions for getting Grub2 onto a USB stick, there are [loads](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22install+grub2%22+%22usb+flash%22) of excellent guides on the web. e.g. [this](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-via-grub2-using-linux/) and [this](http://members.iinet.net/~herman546/p20/GRUB2%20Bash%20Commands.html#GRUB_USB)).

>and - where is the grub.cfg stored?

grub.cfg will live in the **/grub** (or possibly **/boot/grub**) folder in the partition you specified in step two. i.e. it should be on your USB stick as /grub/grub.cfg

> - do other files have to lie about on the stick?

No. Only the bootloader files (in /grub or /boot/grub)

> - how do you secure they / the mbr doesn't get modified from outside?

In the same manner you'd secure any other USB stick. A write prevention switch will prevent any alterations. Keep it on your person or somewhere safe when not in use. If you ever suspect the device may have been tampered with or just want to re-install Grub2 for peace-of-mind or an upgrade or whatever, just back-up your grub.cfg and repeat the 5 commands from above.

>it's a great concept and I'm happy to try it, my skills just aren't that good.

Sorry it took so long for you to get your reply! Hope you find it. Have fun ;-)
