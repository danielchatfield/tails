I am wondering, how about using the following setup. No.1 USB - to keep the tails operating system and No.2 USB with trucrypt installed and use this to save your data. I do not know how this would work if this is easy or not.. I liked tho old Incognito where the whole thing was encrypted with a double password . . has anybody got an idea which is the best way to go.
