>It's all fine and great that you are empowered to do this, but pretty please, make it clear, when suggesting such approaches, that the resulting fork of Tails will *not* be supported by our team.

You can also keep your iso sync'ed to Tails' official version by the method detailed above.
I'd like to understand why this is a touchy subject to the Tails' team, no disrespect intended.
