can you please explain step by step for a beginner, how you do it on linux bash?

and
- where is the grub.cfg stored?
- do other files have to lie about on the stick?
- how do you secure they / the mbr doesn't get modified from outside?

it's a great concept and I'm happy to try it, my skills just aren't that good.
