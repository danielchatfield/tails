>Thanks for this suggestion and the follow up on installing grub and loading Tails from grub. Once you create a TrueCrypt container on the USB stick, is there any way to access this from Tails.

Yes, at least two ways! I'm sure there *used* to be full write access to the volume on the USB stick holding Tails' .iso, just as there still is when booting the .iso from a partition on a fixed HDD. However, I just checked before posting this... and it certainly *isn't* the case with the current (0.12.1) release... So if you'll be booting the .iso from a USB device, perhaps either of the two methods which have sprung to mind in the interim will suit:

1. Multiple partitions. A \"system\" partition for Grub's stuff and your .ISO files and a separate partition on the stick for your own data. Advantages of this method: No additional system requirements. Restricted access to \"system\" files *could* provide extra security against pwnage. Disadvantages: Reduced portability - some ancient BIOSes and Windowses (e.g.XP) can't cope with partitioned USB flashdrives. Inconvenience when upgrading - you can't just drop a new .iso into the system volume from a Tails session.

2. TORAM. Adding **toram** to your kernel boot arguments will trigger Tails to copy its entire system filesystem from the .iso file into RAM and then boot from that. The .iso file will not be used once the data have been copied, its USB stick will not be mounted when the system starts and can be removed/mounted/written-to as you please. In fact, using toram you could run a fully functional Tails session on a machine with absolutely no storage media whatsoever - no HDD no USB flash or flashcards, nothing. Possibly quite handy for the even-more-paranoid-than-usual Tails user ;-) Advantages: Security - your Tails system files need not even be attached to the running system. Convenience - full write access to the stick if you choose to mount it such, you can manipulate files on the system partition and easily update your Tails .iso from within a Tails session. Disadvantage: Requires more RAM: >~1.2GB to run at all and 2GB or more to be useful (no swap remember)

If you'll only be using machines with >2GB RAM, just do 2.

>I cannot create a persistent volume since the OS is running off the ISO image, so I am at a loss to figure out how to securely store any persistent data from a Tails session.

No. I suppose this is unfortunate as many people seem to use the persistence facility. Personally I don't - and actually consider its absence a feature ;-)

>Is there any way I can access the free space on the USB stick (besides the TC container, grub info and the ISO image), such that it is accessible from Tails running off the ISO image?

I think we've got that covered! It's always fully accessible when the .iso is on a fixed HD. Either of the methods above provide comparable utility for removable media.

>Is that what you refer to as the space for unencrypted information in your original post?

Yes. Unencrypted data including potential Truecrypt keyfile(s), keyfolder(s) and container file(s) of course :D

I haven't investigated putting a second hidden Trucrypt partition on a USB stick and whether Truecrypt on Win XP would be able to mount and use it... might be worth trying if XP *and* low-RAM machines are in your envisaged requirements.

>Thanks much for any help.

Hope you find some of this useful!
