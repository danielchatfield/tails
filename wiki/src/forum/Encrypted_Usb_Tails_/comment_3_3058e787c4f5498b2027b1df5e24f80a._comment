Thank you both for the quick response that cleared it up nicely! I guess I'll just have to fool around with it some more but will probably just end up using tails without the encryption. 

However I have one last question it is possible to encrypt within tails(emails or documents) for hiding things while tails is running? But as of now you don't recommend using truecrypt?
