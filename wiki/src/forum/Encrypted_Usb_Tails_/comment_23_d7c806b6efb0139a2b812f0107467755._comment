> I don't understand how bundling your personal files with tails in an iso and changing some configuration files would be considered a fork.

I admit the *fork* word was perhaps a bit too strong, but what I meant does not depend that much on this exact word being used or not.

It mostly depend on what one means with \"Tweak your files and
configure tails to your liking\". Some may mean changing the
desktop background, some others may mean changing the system
behaviour in more drastic ways. It's not clear where exactly the
result becomes a fork.

Please note, however, that going through the remastersys step,
even if it's merely to change the desktop background picture, may
have unexpected consequences: use at your own risk.

In any case, regardless of whether it's a fork or not, the Tails
team won't support such customized versions of Tails: we don't
have the means, nor are interested to, support a general purpose
operating system that everyone customizes to their liking.
