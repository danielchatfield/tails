I've never understood this fixation with \"installing\" tails onto the USB... and having to waste all the remaining space.

This is how I use tails:

* Drop the tails .iso image file (and its companion .pgp sig) onto the stick.
* Create a truecrypt container on the stick.
* Use remaining space for carrying various unencrypted data.

With that setup I can:

* Boot tails from the USB .iso whenever I please.
* Re-verify my tails \"installation\" (the .iso) whenever I feel paranoid
* Mount my secure data at any time from within tails (it's always right there)
* Mount my secure data at any time from any other system with truecrypt installed
* Burn a tails CD from the .iso at a whim for myself, a friend, whatever.
* Carry a handy selection of potential keyfiles/keyfolders with my copy of tails and my tryecrypt container.
* Update tails simply, at any time, by replacing a single .iso image file (and its companion .pgp sig). No formatting or fscking up my data requited.

Why doesn't everyone use tails like this???

Of course, I did have to install grub2 on the stick at some point. And... if one's feeling exceptionally paranoid they might want to re-validate or re-install their stick's grub2 bootloader once in a while.

If anyone is interested, this is what my tails entry in grub.cfg looks like:

(I've replaced my partition's UUID with **-put-partitions-UUID-here-** obviously you'd need to do the reverse.)

    submenu \"TAILS\" {
    menuentry 'Enable Fake WindowsXP desktop' {
            set spec_opts=\"${spec_opts} winxp\"
    }
    menuentry 'Enable Tor brigdes' {
            set spec_opts=\"${spec_opts} bridge\"
    }
    menuentry 'Enable Truecrypt' {
            set spec_opts=\"${spec_opts} truecrypt\"
    }
    menuentry 'TAILS' {
            set isofile=\"/ISOs/tails.iso\"
            set myUUID=\"-put-partitions-UUID-here-\"
            insmod part_msdos
            insmod loopback
            insmod iso9660
            search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root ${myUUID}
            loopback loop $isofile
            set root=loop

            initrd /live/initrd.img
    }
    }
