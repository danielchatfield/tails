There some win32 applications i can't make running using wine on Tails. Same is about VM on Tails.

What if i:
- run windows as main os
- then run Tails under virtual machine
- plug internet connection directly to VM (Tails)
- connect to the internet with Tails

So i'll get smth like Windows -> virtual network -> Tails -> internet

Does this work?

Sorry for stupid question ;)
