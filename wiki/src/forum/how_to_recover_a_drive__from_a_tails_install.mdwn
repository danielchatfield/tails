I installed Tails on the wrong drive. I then formatted to a FAT32 drive in Ubuntu 12.04 using Gpart.

Tails created a 2gig part on a 1T drive and deleted the entire drive.

I deleted the Tails part and then formatted the entire drive as FAT32.

Can I recover the data using an open-source app?

Thank you,
 Tom
