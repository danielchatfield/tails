The \"Mozilla Folks\" have just decided to support h.264 (as well as other \"native\" codecs) installed on the users' systems... so it'll soon be supported in firefox/iceweasel/whatever ...but... there's the rub... \"native\" and \"installed on the system\".

Firefox will only be using what you have installled - being horribly patent encumbered they can't do any decoding themselves... and being horribly patent and royalty encumbered, I don't suppose there'll ever be a suitable codec built into Tails... well, not for the next 20 years or so anyway :-)

Still, once codec support lands in the Fox it'll hopefully just be a matter of running the appropriate .deb from Medibuntu to install the codec. Fingers crossed!

Why won't the world just start using Dirac/Schro FFS? :-(
