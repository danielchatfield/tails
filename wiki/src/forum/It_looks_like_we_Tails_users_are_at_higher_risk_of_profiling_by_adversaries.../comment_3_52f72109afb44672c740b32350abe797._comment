Most of the op is straight from the documentation explaining an important security feature that I was sad to learn most Tails users are currently missing out on. Tails is a wonderful work. But I guess there really are some drawbacks (for good reason, I'm sure it isn't easy). But still, I hate missing out on a good security feature.
