I downloaded and burned tails 0.11 to a DVD-R and cloned it to a 8gb flash drive for persistence. Neither the dvdr or usb finished booting from my windows 7 pc. I tried the dvd on windows vista pc and had success.

The blue bar advances next to where it says debain 6.04 and then it displays the outputs from init. The text is displayed but is too large to fit on the screen. Some other lines that appeared were cannot get IRQ and something about hdd protect.

The screen turns blank and stays in that state. Seems to be a lack of hardware support...any ideas

pc information: HP pavilion dv7-6b55dx
