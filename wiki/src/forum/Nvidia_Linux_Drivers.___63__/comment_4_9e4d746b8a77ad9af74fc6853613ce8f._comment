Hello,

I use Ubuntu 12.04 on a HP Pavilion Slimline machine.

The computer was very noisy with Ubuntu and I had to install the Nvidia propriatary drivers (Nvidia Linux Drivers).

When I run Tails, the computer is noisy also. So I would like to use Nvidia propriatary drivers.

Is it possible ? If yes, how can I do ? Or is there another the manage this issue (the noise of the video card) ?

Thanks in advance for your help.
