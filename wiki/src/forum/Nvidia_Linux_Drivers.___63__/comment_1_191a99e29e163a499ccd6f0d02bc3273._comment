Tails doesn't support [[todo/persistence]] (yet) so you can't really install anything to a \"USB install of TAILS\". You could of course install the nvidia drivers on every Tails boot, configure the X server to use it and restart the X server, but then you'd be running proprietary, closed-source code which could be compromised. I strongly recommend *not* doing this.

Why do you want to use the proprietary nvidia drivers? Is something not working with the alternate, open-source drivers we provide (nouveau)? If so, please [[doc/first_steps/report_a_bug]].
