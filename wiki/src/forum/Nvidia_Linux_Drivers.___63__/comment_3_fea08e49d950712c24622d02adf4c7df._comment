\"Is it possible to install Nvidia Linux Drivers on a USB install of TAILS ?\"

Why would you want to use proprietary drivers on a distribution designed for privacy and security? Have you missed the last two security announcements in previous versions of the official Linux Nvidia drivers which allowed remote access?

If you're going to make the effort to use Tails, make sure all software is free, open source. I haven't tried it in Tails, but many distros support the open nouveau driver, and when you've booted, try this in a terminal:

dmesg | grep voltage

you shouldn't see any error messages from that command, if you do you should upgrade your kernel, at least 3.1.x or higher.
