>I really need Tails, but I can't work with because of this noise. I'm afraid that the card processor burns also..

My sympathies. You needn't worry about cooking your card... the Nouveau drivers don't know how to set it's operating speed *up* form idle, can't operate most of the functions, and don't know how to turn the fan down from maximum... so the fan isn't going flat-out because the chip is hot, it's just been set like that. Your card is running under-clocked, under utilised and over-cooled and therefore the chip is almost certainly running far cooler than it ever has with the competent binary drivers. ;-)

As for the noise though... bearing in mind that you & Nouveau aren't doing any real harm (apart from some wear to a fan bearing), the only \"solution\" I can think of is... earplugs. Sorry!

One day, hopefully in the not too dim-and-distant future, Nouveau will probably evolve enough to use the temperature readings to sensibly control the fan. Performance will *never* compare to the blob of course but I doubt there are many masochists out there using Tails for gaming anyway.

The solution is earplugs and immense patients I'm afraid.
