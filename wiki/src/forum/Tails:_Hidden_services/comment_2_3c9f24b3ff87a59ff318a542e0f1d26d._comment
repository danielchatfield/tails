OP here

If you can why not list most common threats linked to HS and Tails protection agaisnt them or lack thereof? At first correlation comes to mind. But is it the same threat level in all mentioned cases?

Access HS. Host a HS. Upload to HS.
Correlation? Correlatiom? Correlation?

It is also an open subject. It would be great to get diferent feedbacks and other threats to be aware of.
