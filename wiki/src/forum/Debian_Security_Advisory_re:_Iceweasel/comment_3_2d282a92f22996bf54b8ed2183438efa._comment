iceweasel has security bugs, that's right. This is an serious problem, that's right. [[todo/incremental upgrades]] and [[automated tests|todo/automated_builds_and_tests]] are planned. Until this happens, we just can't publish a fully [[tested|contribute/release_process/test]] security point-release every single week. Help is welcome!

In any case, there will always be some kind of vulnerability window between security bugs are discovered, reported, and fixed versions shipped to Tails users; that's why mitigation techniques (e.g. Debian Wheezy will have compiler hardening flags, some kernel hardening, and some AppArmor support) are important as well.
