What does this mean to me, as a new TAILS user? Should I disable javascript in Iceweasel? Wait for a new TAILS update? I wouldn't download and update Iceweasel myself, because I don't know how to properly configure it, nor the plug-ins, to work with TOR. I'm afraid to use TAILS further until I hear from someone who understands this issue better.
