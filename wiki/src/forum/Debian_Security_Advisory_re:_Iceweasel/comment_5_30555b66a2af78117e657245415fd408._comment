In reply to #3

If this was my project I would target same day (Debian not upstream release) automated updates/isos (even without any testing at all if time and manpower doesn't permit)

If an already tested by Debian (in addition to Mozilla) security update can completely break the security of Tails you are doing something wrong and need to thing about why you need to test so extensively in the first place.

In case anyone lost count: Iceweasel in Tails ends up being tested 3 times even though it's an extended support release (just important fixes, no new features) and the top priority is how fast updates are propagated downstream.

I also wonder how incremental updates will look like, they just introduce the update mechanism. The update itself will be exactly the same thing wrt testing and QA as a new iso. If Tails continues their current policy this update feature will only decrease the load on the download servers, not the days of exposure to exploits.
