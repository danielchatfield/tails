The mozilla.debian.net APT repository Tails uses for iceweasel just
started providing the ESR branch. I'm pretty sure we will switch to
using it, and to a certain extent, this will indeed make iceweasel
*security* upgrades less painful by decreasing the amount of work we
have to do to adapt Tails to the updated version.

*Major* iceweasel upgrades, OTOH, sometimes break random add-ons; we
cannot guarantee \"Tails minus one random add-on\" still has the same
security properties as \"Tails\". Tails is no collection of software,
it's an integrated system. I doubt e.g. the TBB developers would dare
to guarantee any kind of security property that would be carried by
\"TBB minus one random file\", see?

Thank you for pointing this out.

Manpower to prepare releases is one of the reasons we don't ship
point-releases every two weeks, but it's not the only one.

In the current state of things, if we display a scary warning messages
about an important security update being needed, that is, a new full
ISO needs to be downloaded and installed, it's likely most users won't
follow the cadence, get used to this warning, learn to ignore it,
lessen the strength of the meaning of such warning messages of ours,
and probably, in the end, upgrade even less often than with they
currently do with the ~monthly point-release we've set as an
informal goal.

So, it could very well be that we dare shipping point-releases more
often and more quickly, once the download and upgrade process gets
less tedious.
