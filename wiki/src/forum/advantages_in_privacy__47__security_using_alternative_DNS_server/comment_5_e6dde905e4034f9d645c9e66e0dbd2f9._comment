>Also, picking up a bad idea from another recent thread in this forum, using Tor to do on-line banking seems like a very bad idea for many reasons:

WTF? Why bring this up here? Anyway, just because you can't comprehend the possible reasons for doing something, you shouldn't infer that it's therefore \"a very bad idea\"

>if your bank is not completely amateur, its security system should light up like a Christmas tree when a regular customer (or more likely someone masquerading as him) connects from a Tor exit node

So. This is immensely trivial.

>if many people did this, that might induce bank-theft gangs to develop MITM schemes targeting Tor users

As will public wifi, etc... however MiTMing SSL is likely to be beyond the capabilities of \"bank-theft gangs\". For governments, on the other hand, it's trivial. Tor could take your banking connection beyond the reach of your government. I can think of many *sound* reasons one might do what you've popped up to summarily condemn.... but obviously a thread on messing with DNS servers isn't the place to discuss them.

>repeatedly raising the subject here could be used as ammunition by our adversaries in a political initiative to outlaw Tor on the false basis that \"it is used primarily for money laundering\", which is not true at all, but which our enemies might want legislators to believe is true (and to repeat, it is a known fact that while some people inside the most powerful government, the U.S. Federal government, support the existence of Tor, others inside the same government oppose it with equal fervor, with the result that politics poses an enduring threat to the very existence of Tor, at least as something which is legal to develop/use/discuss in the U.S.A.)

I find *every* aspect of this statement rather lunatic... but if it's a genuine concern for you, perhaps you should refrain from doing it? It had already struck me as bad form and jarringly odd that you'd attempt to hijack this thread with this *stuff*... even before you introduced this even more puzzling hypocrisy/irony dimension.
