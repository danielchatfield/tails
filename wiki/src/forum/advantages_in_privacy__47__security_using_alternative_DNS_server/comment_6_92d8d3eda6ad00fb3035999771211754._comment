>Comparison of different DNS servers/configuration for non-Tails and non-Tor usage would be quite off-topic for this forum, would it not?

Well.... I supposed you could say so. However, there are a lot of things that get dicussed here at this forum that do not relate directly to Tails. I was also not expecting such strong views in this thread. You can say some of that is not related to the thread here, but this forum is not actually structed and does not have a rules thread.

Anyway it would be nice if anyone can furnish any feedback on how these alternative DNS servers operate. I was not looking to compare these to Tor. We know who wins there.
