>  this forum is not actually structed and does not have a rules thread

It might not have a rules thread but it does have rules, which the Tails developers often makes pretty clear in the off-topic threads, and the main rule of this forum is that only discussion that is directly and specifically related to Tails is allowed here, your initial question is realted to Tor but not to Tails.

> Anyway it would be nice if anyone can furnish any feedback on how these alternative DNS servers operate. I was not looking to compare these to Tor. We know who wins there.

And now you are getting even more off-topic, if you are not looking to compare these alternative DNS servers to Tor then this isn't even a Tor related discussion anymore, and would be better served in a general privacy forum.
