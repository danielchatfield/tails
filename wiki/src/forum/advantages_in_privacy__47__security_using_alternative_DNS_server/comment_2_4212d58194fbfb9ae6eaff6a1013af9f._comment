I am all-but certain that tampering in any way with any of the default DNS settings in Tails is emphatically NOT supported and would be considered extremely dangerous.

Comparison of different DNS servers/configuration for non-Tails and non-Tor usage would be quite off-topic for this forum, would it not?
