OP, I dislike Iran because they support terrorist organizations that my friends and family fought against, and because they are an unstable Islamic regime that tries to manufacture nuclear weapons, and has demonstrated a desire to use those for destroying my country. Now, this is a pure guess, but you probably have zero personal knowledge about Iran and related issues. Now, which one of us is a propaganda shill? Does it also bother you that the Internet was a research project initially sponsored by the American DoD? Maybe you shouldn't use it, too.
