>Dear OP and other commenters. I would like to bring some reason into this discussion.

you didn't bring any reason than only arogance. one more proof that we should not believe to developers. obviously someone must have money and pay programmers from anti-usa countries, to make new tor network, which will be independent from FBI/CIA. by the way, no contribution is better than paid FBI-rat contribution. it is common interest that noone can snitch traffic and if someone can, it is not accidentally. more, developers want to be good for the law and it means they will work more and more against users in order to be better and better for the government. the same development happen with bitcoin.
