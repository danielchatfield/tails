>Did you noticed the virtual keyboard ?

I researched details about hardware keyloggers before several months but I think such keyloggers can also make screenshots and not only to record typing. if hardware keyloggers can not record screenshots, then tails can protect us. it would be nice to be so.

yeah, i will check it, I know for Ironkey USB but it is hellish 200 dollars and I don't like to order online than only to buy personally because when you order online, rats can catch it and modify it. some people are under surveilence 24/h per day and if you order something, they will catch it and modify. so, I didn't find anywhere to buy Ironkey in person and not online. I am in DK but hope to move soon somewhere else. if anyone know any german shop to sell it, it would be good. I would pass through Hamburg if I go anywhere.
