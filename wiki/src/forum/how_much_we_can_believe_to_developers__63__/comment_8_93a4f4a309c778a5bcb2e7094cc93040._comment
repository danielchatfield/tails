it is urgent to make changes in tor network security or architecture.

yep, it is big question why they left this possibility for (government) hackers? maybe this is the hole in the network with aim to help to catch \"mischievous\" people. it is the same with bitcoin, \"anonymous currency\" with main exchangers who ask you for ID and with transactions which can be tracked, so, when you come to exchanger (face to face, to avoid bank account transfer), he can see your face and police can find you before or later. so, it is not anonymous.
