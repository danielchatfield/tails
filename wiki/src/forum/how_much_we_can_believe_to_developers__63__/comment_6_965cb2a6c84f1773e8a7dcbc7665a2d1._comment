if there was a backdoor in the open source code, then all the democracy activists who are using it in Middle East/Asia/Russia ect would be at risk too since their governments would no doubt be able to discover them. 

china is using an impressive system to instantly ban tor bridge nodes once they discover a national connecting to it. if there was some sort of backdoor they would no doubt let Tor exist and monitor everything and round up activists which they can't do.
