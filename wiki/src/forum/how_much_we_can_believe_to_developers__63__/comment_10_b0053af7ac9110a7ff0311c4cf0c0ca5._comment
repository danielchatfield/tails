Dear OP and other commenters. I would like to bring some reason into this discussion.

1. It is clear that you know nothing about Iran or other Middle East countries. All your information comes from biased sources, similarly to the general public. You are no different from them. I will repeat: you are as clueless as the general public. Therefore, please keep your political opinions to yourself.

2. It is clear that you know nothing about Tor history or mode of operation. Therefore, please refrain from propelling ridiculous claims about the Tor project, the network, or its developers.

3. No one owes you anything. Yes, that's right: if a Tor developer has an opinion about Iran, he has a right to that opinion. No one has to subscribe to your ideas about what opinions one can express or not, especially due to point (1) above. You have no authority on the matter.

4. Substantiate your claims and do your research. No one has to explain you anything if you base all your arguments on a couple of posts from the Tor mailing list that you skimmed while not on medication. If someone asks you for a reference, provide such reference, and show why it is representative.

5. Refrain from stating that *we need this* and *we need that* about a project to which you did not contribute, and about which you only learned last week. Your opinion about what is needed is most likely worthless. Spend time on actual research.
