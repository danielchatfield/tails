if you are using public computer it's guaranteed running trojans and keyloggers. the only solution for secure email in that case would be to use the German Privacy Foundation cryptostick, which does all decrypting/encrypting on the usb drive itself, so doesn't touch public computer. 

But they could still get your email login passwords easily unless you used flash based mouse keyboard to log in
