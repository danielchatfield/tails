I would like this discussion to take place here, please.

The point is that, yes, when we use a computer, we rely on the work of numerous other people.

It's hard for a simple user, the target user of Tails, to reach the ability to know everything about GNU/Linux. So lot of them decide to rely on Tails, and it's the best solution I know so far!

But I guess lot of us already heard \"it's ok, i'm using Linux/Tails..\". 

Are friends in danger because of the safety feeling coming with a tool like Tails? How can we give everybody the possibility to decide wisely the way they use computers? How do you keep informed about your system's security? 

Cheers, Erik
