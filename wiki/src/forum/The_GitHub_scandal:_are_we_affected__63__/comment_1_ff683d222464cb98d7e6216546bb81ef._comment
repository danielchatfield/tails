>(The Phalanx family of Trojans is said to attack the Linux 2.6 family of kernels; Tails apparently uses the more recent 3.3 kernel, but I would not be surprised if Phalanx has been updated too.)

Hear, hear. Fans of Linux have been telling me how secure Linux is compared to Microsoft Windows: that it is impervious to trojans, malware, viruses, that it is unnecessary to install an antivirus software for Linux OS.

Thanks, OP, for letting us know about the existence of the Phalanx family of trojans specifically designed to target Linux kernels.
