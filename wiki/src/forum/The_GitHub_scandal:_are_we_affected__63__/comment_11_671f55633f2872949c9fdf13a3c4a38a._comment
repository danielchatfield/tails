Oh god. The nut-job(s?) is out in force on this one!

>The GitHub scandal: are we affected?

Scandal? What scandal? A **tiny** proportion of the people who use GitHub to manage their software projects made a silly mistake and will now have to audit all the changes to their code since they made the mistake, review and re-generate their security & keys, and live down a significant amount of embarrassment.

This is:

1. **NOT** a \"scandal\" - by any stretch of the imagination.

2. An embarrassment and irritation to a handful of **other** projects.

3. **Not related to Tails**

Perhaps people here might attempt to develop the good manners to read, attempt to understand, then, regardless of whether they were capable of understanding or not, heed the spirit and the letter letter of posts signed \"Tails\"?
