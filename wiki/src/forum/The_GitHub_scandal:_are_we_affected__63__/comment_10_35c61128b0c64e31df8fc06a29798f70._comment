@ \"Tails\":

Please reconsider your ban on discussion of firmware issues and peripherals, since these can negatively impact the security/anonymity of Tails users.

> As far as I know, Tails is not directly affected. (Before someone goes crazy about it: I'm not suggesting I know it is indirectly affected. I simply don't know.)

Thanks, appreciate it.

> There's no way anyone can answer this question: one cannot tell for sure such a thing about each of the dozen hundreds of packages shipped in Tails.

I agree it is unfair to ask Tails developers to know, but I hope you will ask the Debian Project what they know.  I am also hoping that some Debian developers will take the time to visit this forum and address my question.
