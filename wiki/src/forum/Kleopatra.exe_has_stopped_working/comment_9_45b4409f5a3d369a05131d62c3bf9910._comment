Woo-hoo! Thanks for the command lines. Now I'll be able to do it all by myself from now on by copy/paste. For other noobs, be sure to enter your user name where the files are and use the correct file name. This line is updated for .13~rc1:) After you import the key, just copy and paste this line and change user name/file location. (I ran it as administrator but don't know if that is necessary.)
