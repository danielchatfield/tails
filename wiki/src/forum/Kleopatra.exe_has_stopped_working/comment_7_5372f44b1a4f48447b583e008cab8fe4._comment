Resolved as a result of very helpful Commnent 6.   I abandoned Kleaopatra.exe which is the method suggested to windows users for verifying the Tails .iso and created the following batch file to run at the windows command prompt.

    gpg --import c:\Users\Tails\tails-signing.key
    gpg --verify c:\Users\Tails\tails-i386-0.12.1.iso.pgp c:\Users\Tails\tails-i386-0.12.1.iso

In structure, it's very similar to the approach suggested for verifying the .iso using Lynux.
