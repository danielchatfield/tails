Maybe I should start another Kleopatra thread but there is trouble verifying the file.

I imported the tails-signing.key ok.

Then I try to verify .13rc1 by using the tails-i386-0.13~rc1.iso.pgp as the input file and tails-i386-0.13~rc1.iso as the signed data file. Is this wrong? I've tried every other combination and yes I've Googled and checked  the documentation.

But I get the tails-i386-0.13~rc1.iso.pgp: Not enough information to check signature validity  error

Signed on DATE by tails@boum.org (Key: ########)

The validity of the signature cannot be verified.

What am I doing wrong?
