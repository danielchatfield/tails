After the Tails default (i.e. without persistent storage).iso has been burned to a USB flash drive and booted up followed by a TAILS/Tor session, if you issue a mount command in the amnesia Terminal window, you will find that the TAILS .iso USB flash drive has been mounted Read Only.

No data will thus have been written to the USB.

However, if you have managed to create a USB that has persistent storage - it all depends on what persistent partitions you have on the USB drive as to what data may have been written to the USB flash drive.

With commands in the Terminal window, during the TAILS/Tor session, if you download any files, you can save them either to another USB flash drive if you have more than 1 USB port, and you can mount any hard drives (as root) to save your downloads.
