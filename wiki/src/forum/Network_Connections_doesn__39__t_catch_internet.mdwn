Hi everybody

I just started using Tails 0.17.2 via USB. But it is not catching any signal of wired/wireless internet. I just tried it on the second computer - still nothing.

None of these icons (listed in the link) doesn't appear.

When I'm coming back to windows, internet appears.

Is it Tails with some bug or some manual configurations I have to do?

Thx in advance!
