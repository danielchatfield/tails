In my opinion, for this to be succeed this torrent should be available from tails website, or from an eppsite created by the devs and not from a user who created a torrent in a random eepsite even if it is a genuine tails image gpg-verifiable.

What do the devs think about this? Good idea, bad idea? Reasons why?
