No time for delving into dpkg right now.

However, I thank the original poster for raising this issue.

If anybody is telling us we ought to trust Google, than those people should cover their faces with their ears and shut up.

It's the monopoly world search engine, and it's the top collaborator with secret services of most any world government, with not much more than a fa√ßade of honesty, possibly when the cumpuction moves in into the hearts of the owners of such a great share of the world fortune, Larry and the other Russian Jew, who seem not to have started as such hypocrites which they have turned into by now.

(pls. not for one of them being a Jew do I criticize them, I'm not racial in any way, it's just that I don't remember the guy's name).

It the original poster is around, pls. let us have those links!
Thanks!

OTOH, which geo-whatever packages are actually installed in Tails, if any?

Not all of us have the time galore to pore over all of that minutiusly.

Thanks!

On a conciliatory note, it is nevertheless good that this topic has been started, whether those packages be in Tails installation or not, because it does draw readers attention to things inmortant for those who use Tails for honest purposes, and I mean people who need privacy to live and communicate freely without supervision, exacly like Occupy people, mentioned above, who I admire most!
