> Maybe i sound naive but i can not comprehend why tools such as geoip* happen to be sneaked into this \"super private\" distro?

I don't think that lack of knowledge and lack of will/time/skills to learn have anything to do with being naive. Pointers: `apt-cache rdepends` and `aptitude why`. Oh, and perhaps you actually want to read the description of these `geoip*` packages: you might be shocked to learn how innocuous they actually are.
