Wait a moment, please, could you at least provide a link to the geo* packages you have in mind?

Before posting I tried man, apropos, but found nothing.  Then I checked the roster of Debian stable packages, but you say I found the wrong packages.  So please, where can we find some information about the geo* packages which *do* ship with Tails? 

We are trying to hold up our end of the bargain, but if we can only find information on the \"wrong\" geo* packages, and you won't give a link to the \"right\" ones, you can surely see why we might feel that you are not helping us to learn more about how Tails works.
