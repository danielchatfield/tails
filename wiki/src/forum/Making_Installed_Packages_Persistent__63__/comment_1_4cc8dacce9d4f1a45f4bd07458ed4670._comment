1. [[Install|doc/first_steps/usb_installation]] Tails 0.11 to a USB drive.
2. [[Create and configure|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure]] a [[persistent volume|doc/first_steps/persistence]].
3. Make sure to add [[APT Packages|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/#index7h2]] and [[APT Lists|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/#index8h2]] in from the persistence presets list.
4. Also add a [[custom directory|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/#index10h2]] for `/home/amnesia/.xchat2`
5. At every boot you have to set an [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]], and then run this command:

    `sudo apt-get install --yes xchat`

These steps can be used for any application (just adapt steps 4 and 5 accordingly). For xchat I'd recommend to also disable CTCP requests since they can leak information (system time), so delete all entries in *Settings -> Advanced -> CTCP replies*.
