I cant open the links in the "download, verify and install" page and therefore i don't know how to continue the installation.

I'v downloaded the iso, and the singing key, the 0.16 signature and even dared to download Gpg4win from somewhere else and istalled thinking that i migth get something but i have no experience with this things and i don't know what to do now.

...What happened to the links? some of them seem to explain things... (sorry for being such a noob)
