Hi there. I am not a programmer, but I appreciate the importance of this project (as it seems to be the only active project of it's type).
How can I contribute to the project? What are some specific things I can do?  I can write documentation, but I can't program, and I can only write English. 

I would be more than happy to help, if you can tell me what to do.

Thanks
