Can anyone explain how entry is limited/regulated?

Entering The Tor Network - Onion.TO

Entering The Tor Network. You are about to visit a Tor Hidden Service website through this webproxy. But first you must read and understand this disclaimer ...

www.onion.to/enter.php - View by Ixquick Proxy - Highlight

If I click View by Ixquick Proxy the Tor network blocks me with a not-so-welcome page and says cookies must be enabled. Who decided that and how? I don't see how to get through this page.

Anyone know what it is about?
