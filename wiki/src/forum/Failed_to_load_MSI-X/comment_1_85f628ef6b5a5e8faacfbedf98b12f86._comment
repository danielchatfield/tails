>How do I pause the screen so that I can copy down the whole text of the error message?

Not easy! ...virtualisation could do this but you'd probably loose the hardware incompatibility you're trying to identify! The usual method it to use a camera! You'll need to turn of the flash and probably have to set the exposure manually.
