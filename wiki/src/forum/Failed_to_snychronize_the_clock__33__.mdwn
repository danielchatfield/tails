I started the Same old problem thread and posted the last logs in that thread. This is further information because the notice is from the sync message: 

Failed to synchronize the clock!

Running htpdate.

Paranoid mode: aborting as one server (https://mail.riseup.net) could not be reached

I also asked in that old thread if this problem could be the result of an on-going MITM attack. So does this sync message help shed any light on that? Anyone else see thhis error? I'm connected despite the error.
