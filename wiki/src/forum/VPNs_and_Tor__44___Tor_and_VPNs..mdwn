It seems to be quite hard to do as is.
network-manager-openvpn-gnome and its dependencies are missing, and Tor is set to automatically launch as soon as a connection is reached.

therefore one must use the terminal while first being connected to tor to download the files from the debian server, enabling the network connection VPN configure dialogue box to activate.

One cannot even reconnect without Tor being there, so how is one to know if the VPN is even configured properly and being routed in? Even exiting tor while connected I still get a TOR-based IP address.

I asked my VPN provider and was told connecting to Tor through the VPN would add an extra layer of security, but speeds would be lowered (obviously).

Any input on this? How to implement your VPN, how to use and connect to it while connected or disconnected to Tor, which one (Tor > VPN, VPN > Tor) would be the safest.

I've read up on this and find the answers to be inconclusive, hoping someone(s) here can shine some light on the matter.
