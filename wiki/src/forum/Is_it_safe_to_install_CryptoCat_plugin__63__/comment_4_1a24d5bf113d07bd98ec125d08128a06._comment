Even more important would be to audit Silent Circle.  It seems that some of its services may already be compatabile with Tails; others seem to require using an Android smart phone.

While Phil Z has superb credentials, re \"it only takes one\", see the historical example of Crypto AG (a non-US company which offered \"strong cryptograpy\" for non-US governments in the pre-PGP days) for a worrisome precedent.  

What do you think?
