There have been several threads on this topic in this forum, and there seems to be general agreement among those who *have* tried to use OTR chat via pidgin that pidgin is hard to use (very confusing GUI, etc.).

This is all rather frustrating since it seems clear by now that OTR and a small handful of other secure chat applications are really the only somewhat secure/private/anonymous options for chat.
