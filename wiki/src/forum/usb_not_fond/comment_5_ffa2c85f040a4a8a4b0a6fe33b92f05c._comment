find out the name of your usb device using disk utility. it will be something like /dev/sdb (most likely NOT /dev/sdb1 or /dev/sdb4)

open a terminal and install syslinux:

sudo apt-get install syslinux

press enter.
next, in the terminal type:

sudo su -

press enter. then, locate where your 0.11 iso is. if you are not sure, in the following line, after 'isohybrid' and a space, drag and drop the iso into the terminal which will put in the location then type the rest of the line (--entry 4..):

isohybrid [drag and drop tails.iso] --entry 4 --type 0x1c

press enter.
next, in the following line, drag and drop the iso into the terminal after 'cat' and a space and then follow it with your device (eg /dev/sdb) and the rest of the line (&& sync):

cat [drag and drop tails.iso] > [device] && sync

hit enter and wait a few mins until the terminal shows a flashing command prompt again. reboot your computer and make sure your bios boots from usb first. worked for me no problem.

also, if you are not sure, you don't use the [ ] in the commands above.

good luck, let us know if it does not work.
