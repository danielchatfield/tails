##0.17 - Monkeysphere: why is it still running and part of Tails?

The Monkeysphere browser plugin has been removed, and in an older post during 0.16's lifetime, this same question was asked but not resolved. 

I'll ask again:

Why is Monkeysphere still running and part of Tails when the browser plugin is gone?

What is it doing????????

/usr/bin/perl -wT /usr/bin/monkeysphere-validation-agent /usr/bin/seahorse-agent --execute x-session-manager
