I think the hardware-level attacks that can be done against Tails are hardware keyloggers and malware on BIOS. If the BIOS is infected it can secretly install things like keyloggers as Tails is launched I think. Will flashing the BIOS will remove the malware on BIOS? Does doing that completely replace the BIOS or does it just upgrade a few features?
