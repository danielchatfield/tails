Sirs, sometimes when I desire to send an urgent mail to a team of whistleblowers and somehow canâ€™t use Tails in the PC having no pendrive and Tor Browser Bundle in the PC having administrative restrictions, I have to use proxy chain of 3 https proxies of different countries through an external application Proxifier. Earlier I was used to use ProxyCap but this application leaks DNS everytime despite using all methods to prevent it.

Should I expect security by using this mode of proxychaining during emergency situations
