Hi,

Regarding the red poweroff/shutdown button in the upper right-hand-corner:

It is much too easy to hit this accidentally when merely trying to close a window. 

Have you considered moving the shutdown button to the /left/ side?

Also, is it really necessary for this button to /immediately/ shut down the system upon being hit even just once? Wouldn't it be better for it to prompt a choice of shutdown, log-out or suspend? Or at least, "Do you really want to shut down?"

Thanks.
