Why anyone would choose to use Liberte is beyond me.

According to Distrowatch, they have released one version.

One version, which is filled with old packages, which haven't received the updates and applied them in a new version. Compare this to Tails, which releases updates with security/bug patches.

Ask yourself, what is to gain from using Liberte, outdated, likely vulnerable and if I may say so, questionable in leadership?
