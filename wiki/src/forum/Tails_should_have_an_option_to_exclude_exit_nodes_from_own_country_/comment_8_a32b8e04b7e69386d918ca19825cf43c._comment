>Though I did wonder about a couple of nodes which popped up a while ago, purporting to be in Antarctica. US \"scientific research\" bases too perhaps?... hmmmm...

I remember seeing those. Would *seem* to suggest that either:

* The geo-location data is a sham

...or...

* Someone halled a few Tor servers to Antarctica and is using a satellite link to provide Tor services.

...or...

* Someone's run an adsl line to S. Georgia

...or a million other possibilities. Can't think of one that doesn't smell fishy though.
