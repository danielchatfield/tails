An exit node is more vulnerable because the ip address can be found. It has no direct relation with a user, it can be anyone in the world who uses your exit node. Exit nodes draw attention, because users tend to visit \"controversial\" websites, or exchange \"controversial\" material.

Excluding exit nodes from your own country does not help. A user from the same country is \"anonymous\". For the operator of the exit node it does not matter since he's more \"visible\", no matter who uses it. In fact he can't control who the users are, nor the contents they are exchanging.

Usually exit nodes are in \"safe\" countries, so the people in a \"dangerous\" countries can \"pass through the wall\" safely.

It could very well be possible there are more exit nodes in your country. Tor network only provides a fraction of available exit nodes to a user. To prevent all exit nodes of country X to be \"exposed\".

It is a good idea to read the documents about the legal issues running an exit node. If you feel unsure, or unsafe, don't run an exit node.
