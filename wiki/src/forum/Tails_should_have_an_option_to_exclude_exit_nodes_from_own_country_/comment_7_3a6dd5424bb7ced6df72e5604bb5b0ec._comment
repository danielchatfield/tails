>In the Tor Browser bundle it is possible to use for example: ExcludeNodes {us}. But in Tails it does't work. Please fix this next time, if possible. Thank you!

Works for me. How much do you trust the advertised \"country codes\" anyway?.. or, for that matter...

>What happens if CIA/FBI/NSA has boxes of servers that modify exit nodes in ohters country's ?

Indeed. Or what if the CIA/FBI/NSA/whatever just installs a couple of tor boxen in every US embassy, US consulate, official residence, US military base, etc around the world? Not difficult. Not expensive.

>How do we know for sure ?

We don't. We can't.

Though I did wonder about a couple of nodes which popped up a while ago, purporting to be in Antarctica. US \"scientific research\" bases too perhaps?... hmmmm...
