Obviously the TAILS user using his own country's exit node will be within the direct jurisdiction of his country's own laws. Secondly only a few nodes in small country also mean that only a few connections will be going thru them, and anyone can be tracked down quite easily.

For example, there are 3 nodes from India and I have never seen any exit node from Inida randomly being my exit node. If I configure any of that node into exit (last) node for web browsing, perhaps my traffic will be the only traffic passing thru that IP (exit) and I can be easily tracked.
