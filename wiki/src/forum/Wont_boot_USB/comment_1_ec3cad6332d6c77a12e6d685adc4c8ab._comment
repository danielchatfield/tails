Which version of Tails are you using? 

The case you describe ('*after the initial boot screen for Tails shows up, i select English*') seems to correspond to a Tails 0.10. In that case, you should consider [[switch to the very last version|download]]

Otherwise, did you correctly [[verified the downloaded ISO|download/#index3h1]], and followed the [[installation steps|doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation]] as documented?

Good luck,
