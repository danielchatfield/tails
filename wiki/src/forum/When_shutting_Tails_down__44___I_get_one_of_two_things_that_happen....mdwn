When I shut Tails down one of two things happen. Usually, I get shown a bunch of text saying that tails is shutting down and it's okay to remove the cd/usb, then it just freezes and nothing happens at which point I just manually shut down VirtualBox (i use tails in VB). But sometimes after I get the message that it's okay to remove the cd/usb, I get a wall of fast scrolling text which I'm guessing is Tails deleting itself from memory (?????). When this happens, it never ends and again, Tails doesn't shut itself off and I manually shut down. I've let it run for 5-7 minutes and I just force a shut down. Why am I getting two different behaviors at shut down? Should Tails shut itself off?
