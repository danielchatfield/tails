>I have come to the conclusion that I don't think it has anything to do with those error messages, because they seem common, but still allow people to boot.

Yes, most of those are just last warnings from one developer to others that features they are using have been superseded and are about to be removed. They're not really meant for end users. A useful error message could easily be lost among them though.

Good luck!

Have you ever tried Debian stable (Squeeze)? Tails is built on Squeeze, so if it worked, this problem would be specific to Tails.
