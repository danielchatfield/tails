I have had no issues with multiple other versions of linux, ever. No major issues at least, and somewhat normal at the very least.

In regards to the second comment, I already tried all of those things in the \"Tails does not start entirely\" section. Among my own debugging methods, and nothing is working. I have come to the conclusion that I don't think it has anything to do with those error messages, because they seem common, but still allow people to boot. I have also tried on different mediums, two dvds and a USB drive. Same result. I will try to video it and catch the errors, but no promises. Thank you again, as I know this isn't much information to go on!
