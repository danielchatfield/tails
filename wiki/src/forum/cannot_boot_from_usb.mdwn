Hello i am new to tails.. I made an ISO disc and booted up in it with no problems..
Today I put in a 8gb tdk pen stick and followed the prompts in tails to make a bootable pen stick. 
When I try to boot up from the pen it is reverting to the windows operating system.
I cannot see the pen stick listed in windows (my computer) anymore.. 
If I go to the disc manger it shows up there..

has anyone got any idea what I did wrong..

thank you...
