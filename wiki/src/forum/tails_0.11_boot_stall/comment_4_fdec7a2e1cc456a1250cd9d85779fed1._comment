Well: brand new hardware needs brand new hardware support. Linux got a lot better at it, but it's not all vendor who play the game nicely.

Tails development resources are very limited and releases are not tested, as far as I know, on hundreds of different laptops like some commercial distributions do. If you want Tails to work on your hardware, you have at least to give enough information to get the problem solved.

Given what is described, the problem looks related to graphic adapters. What kind of chipset do you have? Have you tried to boot without the \"splash\" and the \"quiet\" parameters on the command-line?
