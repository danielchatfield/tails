Failsafe mode is no different. From looking at other posts on this so greatly orangized forum, I discovered some tried the parameters vga=0x314 nomodeset and xorg-driver=vesa in similar issues to this thread's. I had no success with either of these and using failsafe mode. I will post more information on the system I was using as well.
