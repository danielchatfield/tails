Did you [verify](https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#index3h1) the ISO you received?

If you did, then you must have buggered up the DVD burning step (which you've glossed over) and then buggered up whatever \"manually installed to usb\" is meant to mean.

You should probably [READ THE FUCKING MANUAL](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html)

There's **NOTHING** more that can be said to you here which hasn't been explained thoroughly (with illustrations) in the documentation and repeated dozens of times already on this forum. There's a search box in the top right corner you know.


But im jest noob... i too stoopid to this verify thing. wot it meeen?.. blah, blah, blah...
