hidden service server?
bitcoin qt already istalled and even I started loading all transactions, at control through a proxy 127.0.0. but there was no place on the 8 gb flash drive,and I can't understand, at any settings of the client the traffic passes through tor?
how to be sure that a traffic goes through tor?
and why my flash drive at the capacity of 8 Gb, has free ~700mb?
