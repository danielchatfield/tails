most modern routers contain backdoors for LE/TLA.

routers aside, can you be sure you don't have a PCI device firmware and/or BIOS root-kit?

Did you know your on-board sound card, network card, and possibly more on-board components are a vector for trojans? One cannot easily rip these parts off of the motherboard, even if you try and disable some or all in BIOS they may still remain.

Those who suggest a safe computer is a non networked (LAN or net) computer are incorrect, there have been attacks via RF in the nearby area of the CPU and/or satellite attacks. Packet radio modules, which many distros stupidly provide, have also worked in tandem with network protocols and with piggybacking to invade the OS.

There is no privacy in the digital world, if it's electronic, it's pwnable by TPTB.
