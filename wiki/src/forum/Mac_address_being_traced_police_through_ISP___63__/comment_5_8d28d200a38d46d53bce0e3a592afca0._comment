wireless users:

individual devices like mice and keyboards, NICs are stupid! you're open to a lot of attacks.

other:

let's recall arp/dns poisoning/spoofing.

let's remember to examine binaries and ensure they were signed by the issuer with gnupg.

commercial devices using proprietary technology and often their software are backdoored and firmware vulnerable to rootkits

hang around 2600, phrack, packetstormsecurity, and other like sites and learn that your win/mac/*nix box is easily rooted in many ways and the root-kit detectors, which are few, like chkrootkit, rkhunter, and a couple of others, don't provide enough security. a lot of simple root-kits slip through those tools, and just try examining chkrootkit's STRINGS output sometime and GOOGLE for results of odd looking text, just try and determine what is malicious and what is not!

antivirus which supports *nix? if proprietary, best of luck to you then, mal-ware like flame can exist for years and survive detection, probably on purpose - I'm guessing most Western mal-ware removal companies are told to white-list government spyware.

GOOGLE about the former FOUNDER of the company WEBROOT, Steven Thomas.

Maybe he was onto something? You have to read many articles about him to get a better picture of how odd the events were surrounding his death. Webroot Software founder Steven Thomas was found dead in Hawaii. Save the articles and store them off-line on read only media because the stories will disappear eventually.

GOOGLE for *nix trojans and root-kits, there are A LOT.
