Censorship is about controlling your freedom of expression.
This forum is *not* about creating a place where you can practice
your freedom of expression. How we moderate this forum makes sure
it stays a fine place for what it's meant to be used, and does
not welcome random spam, hate talk or off-topic discussions.
You're welcome to practice your freedom of expression about
off-topic matters in other places than this forum: there's no way
*we* can control it, so we can't censor you, and we're glad we
can't.

> mysterious curl connections when Tail 0.16 boots

That one was spammed something like 15 times between March 27th
and April 2nd. I'm sorry, I got fed up of removing spam, so
I dropped the entire thread. Next time, please do check your
facts in more details before assuming bad intentions and using
strong words such as \"censorship\".

> more deleted......

I still think the \"Something useful you can do with Tails\" post was entirely off-topic. Tails being used to do \"something\" does not make \"something\" relevant here.

The last one has the \"Remove spam on closed threads.\" commit
message. Contrary to full-blown forum software, our current forum
lacks a really usable *technical* way to close a thread when e.g.
the OP has been answered, or when the discussions has moved
off-topic. So, we don't rely on technical solutions, but on
a social one: we sometimes declare a thread is closed. Once this
is done, if some people don't care and go on
discussing (generally off-topic), then we delete the comments
that were added after the thread was closed. Simple.

> this is great disrespect to people took time in writing!!!

Seriously... the fact someone spent time to write something does not mean *we* have to happily host it.

Now, you just wasted 15 minutes of Tails developer's time.
Congrats. If that was not your goal, then please reconsider the
way you interact with us.

I'm not interested in discussing this any further with someone
who apparently thinks we owe them to host any possible discussion, so this thread is now closed.
