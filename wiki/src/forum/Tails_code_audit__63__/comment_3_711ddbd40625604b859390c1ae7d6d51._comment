Yes, I agree with that, Tails is mature enough now.

What about writing a message to a couple of security groups to ask them to have a look?

Something like *\"Tails is now widely used and trust by a large amount of users, we would like to have your opinion\"*, pointing to the [[contribute/design]], [[contribute/release_process/test/]] and [[contribute]] pages.

Would you like to give a try?

Cheers,  
Tom
