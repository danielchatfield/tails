I think the moral of this thread is: If you'd like to know how **Tor** works, then [RTFM](https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en).

If, after reading [TFM](https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en) questions or concerns remain, then discuss them **with the *Tor* community** - exactly as advised on the welcome page of [TFM](https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en)!
