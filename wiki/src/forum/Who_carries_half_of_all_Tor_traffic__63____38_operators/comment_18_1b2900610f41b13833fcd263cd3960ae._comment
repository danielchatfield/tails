I acknowledge this is problem. The good news is that this problem is
well known, as is its solution: improving the diversity of the Tor
network, by running more high-traffic exit nodes. So, I think this
topic needs absolutely no additional discussion (especially, not
here), but actual *action*, that would be better organized on the
mailing-list dedicated to Tor relay operators.
