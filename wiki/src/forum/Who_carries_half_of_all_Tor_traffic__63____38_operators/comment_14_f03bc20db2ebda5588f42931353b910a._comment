Anyone can check my figures, and I urge other Tor users to do so.  Even better, make several such snapshots over the coming year.

The proper response to the situation is not to mock or call names, but to discuss how to interpret these results and what to do about the problem.  

Ideally, this discussion should take place in a Tor forum run by torproject.org and allowing unregistered users to post using Markdown.  But no such forum yet exists.  So with the forbearance of the moderator in this forum, I have attempted to at least raise the issue.
