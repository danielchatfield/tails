So, the moral of the story, this post's data, is what? Don't use Tor, which means, don't use Tails, or any other setup that uses the Tor network, or what? I have been using Tor for years for whatever reasons that I have, but this data above makes me think twice about continuing to do so. I know that it is probably the only game in twon, but it appears that Tor might be the perfect trap for all users including government agents and corporation spies, or you name it, so why would they, the first two that is, continue to do so assuming everything that this poster has posted is true, and I think that it is!

Convince me that I am wrong, meaning, give me a plausable reason to keep on using the Tor network. I know the alternative.
