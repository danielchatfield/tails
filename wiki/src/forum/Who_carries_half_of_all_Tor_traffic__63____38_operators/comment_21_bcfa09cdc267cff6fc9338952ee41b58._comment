> Why this strange insistence on mailing lists?

I don't know why the ones who are doing actual work to fix this problem are discussing it on a mailing-list, but I'm sure that:

1. Here is no good place to discuss how and why to operate Tor relays.
2. Here is no good place to discuss whether a mailing-list is the best tool for discussions that currently happen on the `tor-relays` mailing-list. Such meta discussion should happen among the people who are doing this work, and discussing it, not among Tails users.

Discussion closed.
