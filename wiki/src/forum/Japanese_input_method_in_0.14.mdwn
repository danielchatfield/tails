For some reason I cannot activate Anthy (japanese input method) when using Iceweasel. I can input japanese in gedit and copy it over, but it doesn't work directly in Iceweasel. Is this a bug?

I also wonder, is there any way to enable Anthy without selecting Japanese language/keyboard layout in login screen. I regulary need to input japanese when searching, but want swedish language/keyboard layout otherwise.

On a side note, certain kanji characters renders pixeled instead of smooth, making them somewhat hard to read, not to mention that the inconsistency looks ugly.
