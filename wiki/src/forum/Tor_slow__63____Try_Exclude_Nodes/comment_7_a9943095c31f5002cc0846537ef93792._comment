I think that warning needs to be more nuanced.

This thread suggests a rather desperate (temporary!) response to what may be a serious problem with load balancing in the Tor network, which can be resolved by (temporarily) excluding some of the highest bandwidth Tor nodes.  

The one hundred fastest Tor nodes carry fully half the traffic, according to at least one site which reports observed bandwidth of Tor nodes other than bridges (and I have the graph which proves it).

In general, I think it is reasonable to expect that excluding some low bandwidth Exit routers which are known to be bad may be worth the tradeoff, especially if you have reason to think you would only rarely use them if you didn't exclude them.

I myself tried (apparently not very successfully) to emphasize that the situation here is unfortunately the worst possible, where in order to use Tor at all one apparently needs to exclude some high bandwidth Nodes.  I tried to emphasize that the suggestion was to try this temporarily and to try reverting to the default after a few days.
