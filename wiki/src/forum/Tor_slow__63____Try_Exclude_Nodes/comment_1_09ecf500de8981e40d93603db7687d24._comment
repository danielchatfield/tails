@ \"Tails\": should I name the company, or should I refrain from doing that?

I don't want to accuse anyone of anything, and I can think of some possible reasons for what I have been observing which are innocuous.  But if I name them perhaps others can experiment by excluding them and see if that improves their websurfing via Tor.

This company seems to be listed as one of the companies to be contacted in cases of suspected copyright infringement.   Make of that what one will.
