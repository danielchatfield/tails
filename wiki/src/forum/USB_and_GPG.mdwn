I was really hoping someone could help me out, I have tails installed onto a 32gb usb drive. I would like to use GPG with this, but every time I make a new GPG key, and shutdown everything Is lost!! Is there a way to be able to save those GPG keys to the USB with out compromise security of the USB or GPG keys?!
