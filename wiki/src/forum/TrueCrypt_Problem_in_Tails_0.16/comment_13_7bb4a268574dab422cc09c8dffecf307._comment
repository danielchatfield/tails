>One thing though, I did have a problem years ago creating a TC 7.0 container in Puppy 5x until I went to Settings > Preferences > System Integration, and put a check in the box that said \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\" Then, I was able to create a container with Fat (so I could open it in Windows), and I did it again with 7.1 and in 7.1a.

I wonder if that might be the root of your problem. Could you confirm for us, as accurately and precisely as you can recall, how you **created the problem container**, indicating which (if any) of the details you're unsure of. Particularly helpful could be:

Which version of TC was used?
Was \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\" set?
Which hashes and ciphers you chose for that container.

Also, have you tried toggling the \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\" setting during your attempts to mount the container in Tails?

A terse summary of the results you've had trying to mount it might be helpful too. Something like:

    WinXP:      success
    Puppy 5:    success (with \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\")
    Puppy 5:    fails   (without  \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\")
    Tails 0.16: fails   (with \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\")
    Tails 0.16: fails   (without  \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\")
