\"There's no reason why you should have a problem using TC6.3 but comment 1 suggested:

    a different copy of TC

Not a different version, anyway.\"

================================

I know that TrueCrypt 7.1a, which is what my container was created with is \"backward compatible\" because it say so at \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt#Modes_of_operation,\" which says:

\"TrueCrypt currently uses the XTS mode of operation. Prior to this, TrueCrypt used LRW mode in versions 4.1 through 4.3a, and CBC mode in versions 4.0 and earlier.[7] XTS mode is thought to be more secure than LRW mode, which in turn is more secure than CBC mode.[8] ..... Although new volumes can only be created in XTS mode, TrueCrypt is backward compatible with older volumes using LRW mode and CBC mode.[7] Later versions produce a security warning when mounting CBC mode volumes and recommend that they be replaced with new volumes in XTS mode.\"

However, even if TC 6.3a could open my TC 7.1a container, it will not prove that I can use it in Tails 0.16, which uses TrueCrypt 7.1a, the most current version of TrueCrypt. Earlier Tails' versions had 6.3, but using an earlier version of Tails would be a security risk. What's the point is even discusing an earlier version of TrueCrypt?

Furthermore, I did say that my TC 7.1a container does open in, as you (Comment #1) put it, in \"another OS entirely.\" I said that I used it in various Puppy distros, JonDonym, and Windows XP, SP3. I do not think that trying to open my TC 7.1a container in \"PartedMagic\" would help either. I already made the comparison in Puppy, etc. I have used PartedMagic before.

I know that I can create a TC container on a stick using Tails 0.16. I did it, and it opened in JonDonym's copy of TrueCrypt too. As I have said, that's not the point. The header of my TC container is not damaged, and yes, I did back it up a while back! I have been using my TC 7.1a container back and forth from Linux to Windows since TrueCrypt went from 7.1 to 7.1a, which has been a few weeks after February 7, 2012 when 7.1a came out. I have been using TrueCrypt since version 6.3, which came out on October 21, 2009.

One thing though, I did have a problem years ago creating a TC 7.0 container in Puppy 5x until I went to Settings > Preferences > System Integration, and put a check in the box that said \"Do not use kernel cryptographic services.\" Then, I was able to create a container with Fat (so I could open it in Windows), and I did it again with 7.1 and in 7.1a. My container resides on a 3.0 Patriot stick, and is about 40 some GBs. As I had said, if I created a TC container in Windows (with Fat), it will not open in Linux. I found that out on my own.

I really like Tails with its very helpful Documentation. It's also neat and orderly, etc., but I must be able to use my TC 7.1a container, otherwise I have to go to something like JonDonym, which has TrueCrypt 7.1a on board, and the most secure browser (JonDoFox) that I have seen according to tests that I have made at \"http://ip-check.info/?lang=en\" with various browser including the TorProject Bundle browser.

I will check back for a reply. Thanks for your help.
