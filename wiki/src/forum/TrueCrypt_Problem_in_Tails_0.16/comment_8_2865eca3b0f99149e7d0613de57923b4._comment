I was successfully able, on Tails 0.16, to:

1. Create an encrypted file container with TrueCrypt.
2. Reboot.
3. Set an administrator password in Tails Greeter.
4. Start TrueCrypt.
5. Select the container file.
6. Click \"Mount\".
7. Enter the encryption password for the encrypted container.
8. Enter the Tails administrator.

Can you please try to reproduce this sequence of actions, and report back the exact and complete error messages you get, if any?
