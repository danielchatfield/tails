There's no reason why you should have a problem using TC6.3 but comment 1 suggested:

>a different copy of TC

Not a different *version*, anyway.

I can't think of any obvious reason for this. Perhaps try the TC on PartedMagic for comparison. Is it a container *file* or a TC *partition*? What filesystems are involved?
