No problem.

This is a concern. I'd like to know the outcome for my own peace of mind as well as helping you get to the bottom of the problem. The fact that you **can** reliably use the container under the appropriate environment is reassuring. I'm suspecting some sort of inconsistency between the libraries... along the lines of something somewhere using \"Whirlpool\" (-T) or \"Whirlpool\" (-0) (which were both formerly known correctly as \"Whirlpool\") in place of \"Whirlpool\"!

Will be checking back for your update(s). Please drop us all a line if you identify the cause yourself, or via a bug report, or whatever.
