My first thought: Oh, that's bad. But let's go over the individual patches quickly

https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#firefox-patches

2, 3, 8 are all about making things memory only to prevent data being written to disk that can be retrieved through forensic analysis. Those do not apply to Tails.

1, is to prevent fingerprinting. Tails already has its own fingerprint and the fingerprint of all Tails user is the same.

4, 5, 10  would be nice having. As I understand it they would benefit Tails.

6 is absolutely NECESSARY! \"Randomize HTTP pipeline order and depth\". There is no reason not to use such cheap method of defense against traffic fingerprinting. https://blog.torproject.org/blog/experimental-defense-website-traffic-fingerprinting

7, 9 do not apply

11, makes New Identity actually work, AFAIK tails recommends to reboot instead of using this feature, could still benefit Tails.

12 and 13 aren't yet documented but they seem to be about fingerprinting again.

Summary: Out of the 13 patches Tails should look into 4, 5, 6, 10, 11.
