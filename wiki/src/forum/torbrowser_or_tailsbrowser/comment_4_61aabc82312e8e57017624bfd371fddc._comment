Two things that shocked me about Tor Browser Bundle:

1.) `browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash' is *enabled*

2.) Bookmark backups are automatically saved.

So it's probably best to only store and use TBB from within an encrypted volume.

Also, as pathetic as this \"forum\" is here at TAILS, at least it's something- and the TAILS devs and apparently other people trying to be helpful actually try and do often answer questions. 

Tor, on the other hand...no forum, so people post question on Tor blog, and they are overwhelmingly *ignored*.
