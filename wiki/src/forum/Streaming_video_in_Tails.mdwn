Hello all:

I am really getting into the ins and outs of streaming vieo over the net.  There are some really interesting streams available to the Windows user, especially due to the fact that Windows supports many different video players.

But I'm having a lot of trouble in Tails with this.  An example:  a site that I use to stream video from uses Flash for that stream.  But I'm having a hell of a time installing Flash on Iceweasel.

So I downloaded Goggle Chrome for Debian.  Now, I'm having a really hard time installing Google Chrome in Tails, or anything else for that matter.

Can someone please help with this?  Does anyone have experience with streaming video in Tails, and if so, how would I be able to do it myself?
