\"Are you sure that you see traffic to Tor nodes being dropped? That's certainly not how it's supposed to be and suggests a bug\"

yes, it begins with dropping local traffic to port 53, then there's at least one mention of dropping traffic from my address to a tor node.

there's also some local traffic to local traffic on tor node ports being dropped too.

thanks for the reporting link, but i've reported it here. please include it in your bug tracking and post the trac url here.
