>I find it amazing how all you seem to care about is damage control using weasel words and hand-waving, and are completely disinterested in the actual truth.

Agreed, I've never encountered such defensive, empty, and negative, or out right hostile responses as I have here, especially to simple questions!

This is the last version of Tails I use. It's easier to pick from any number of Linux distros and use a LiveCD with TBB and not run into stupid shit and the same for answers.

Have fun 'counting' others, or whatever bullshit voodoo you have going on in scripts and/or binaries you fail to deliver simple answers for, there will no longer be any Whispers, backs, or TAILS for me anymore.

Heads, I win..

Tails you lose!
