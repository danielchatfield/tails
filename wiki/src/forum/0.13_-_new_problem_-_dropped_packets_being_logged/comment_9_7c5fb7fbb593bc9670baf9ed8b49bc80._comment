This same post has been spamming a high proportion of otherwise unrelated threads lately. In every one of those hijacked threads, it has politely received *the answer*. Just as it has done here. Twice!


This is beginning to look less and less like someone who simply \"doesn't get it\" and more like some sort of sustained FUD attack and/or an ongoing campaign to bait/irritate the community/developers.

Is there a policy document on how to address this phenomenon?

Sorry OP. Off topic I know but your thread seems to have been thoroughly perverted already. Please forgive my contribution! ;o)
