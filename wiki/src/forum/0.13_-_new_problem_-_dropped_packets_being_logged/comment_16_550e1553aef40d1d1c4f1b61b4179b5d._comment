> Sorry, but it is the opposite. We usually first design and then implement, as most good software development practice advice to do. The PELD has been written a long time ago. It is periodically updated when we find and design new features / issues. Usually through the cycle of writing todo pages where ideas are discussed.

LOL. Are you the bullshitter in charge or something? Have you considered the career of presidential press-secretary or similar? I find it amazing how all you seem to care about is damage control using weasel words and hand-waving, and are completely disinterested in the actual truth.

Let me help you here. Commit adding the real-world experience passage: [Dec 14, 2010](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=commitdiff;h=9ce153378aeca24c659d586ac097d48863bcc395). Security checker implementation: [Feb 4, 2010](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=history;f=config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/amnesia-security-check;h=854ae66af19e2fb5a4fdfb9f0293f296657e6ce1;hb=9a4860af2d0d0daa98c757e9b57ffae290508c96).

In other words: Incognito's documentation has been adapted to the situation in Amnesia after-the-fact. Nothing was discussed. No TODO pages were created. Amnesia was \"pinging the mothership\", in words of the user above, long before PELD was imported and updated. That passage did not exist. Will you admit now that you were plain out bullshitting, or do I need to play out the whole dead parrot scene by Monty Python?

> We already do that, sorry if you are not our only user.

I am not even the same guy. You seem to have a problem with the idea that more than one person might disagree with your \"one true vision\".

> For other people, please don't come into his game by replying to his provocations.

Whereas all you are doing is replying to non-provocations with bullshit. Well done!
