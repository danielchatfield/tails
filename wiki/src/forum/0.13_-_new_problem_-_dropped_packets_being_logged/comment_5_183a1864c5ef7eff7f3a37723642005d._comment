>using this tool

when i first boot tails one of the first changes i make is to run synaptic and load my custom markings file to remove lots of packages including whisperback..

nothing about my machine should be communicated back to the mothership and i'm offended my boot process results in a security check and a ping like hello to your servers without my permission..

please tell me where i may disable this unauthorized tracking or i'm dumping tails. this new version has been acting strange anyway so i may ditch it cause of that too..
