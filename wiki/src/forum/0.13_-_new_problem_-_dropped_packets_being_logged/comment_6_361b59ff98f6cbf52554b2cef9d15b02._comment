Feel free to [[contribute/customize]] your own [[builds|contribute/build]]. This should be way more efficient if you have doubts on the package selections than uninstalling them on each boot.

You should not expect any support from Tails developers for those images, though.

Nothing about your machine is sent to perform that security check. If you can read Perl, have a loot at [tails-security-check source](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-security-check;h=48f86748296a15bd6e08d130eb1ff064fa8a92f7;hb=refs/heads/stable). The process is fairly simple: determine when the running system was built (by looking at `/etc/amnesia/version`); fetch the [security feed](https://tails.boum.org/security/index.en.atom); display any entries in the feed that have been posted later than the build date.

If this process is \"a ping like hello\", could you describe what Tor does when it connects to the directory authorities?
