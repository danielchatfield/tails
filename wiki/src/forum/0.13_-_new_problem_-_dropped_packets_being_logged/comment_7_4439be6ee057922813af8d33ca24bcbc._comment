>If this process is \"a ping like hello\", could you describe what Tor does when it connects to the directory  authorities?

I use Tails to use Tor. I expect Tor to work as designed.
Tails giving a hello, encrypted or not, back to the mothership, reminds me of most Windows machines which hit Microsoft's time server(s) with each boot.

#Instead of leading me in different directions, talking me through a maze of other options, please tell me how to disable this communication between my boot-up of Tails and the Tails server(s): the initial count or ping/hello and the security checks.

I know how to check your site for updates. I don't need the program checking and I don't want any boot stats provided to you from my system, encrypted or not.

Please tell me how to disable all of that - without the info on building my own Tails distro. It cannot be that difficult. This is an *open* OS, right? Let's appear more *open* in our replies and to the point.
