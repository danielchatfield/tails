> I expect Tor to work as designed

Then you probably expect Tails to work as designed as well. The [design document](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/#index20h3) state that :

    A PELD running copy SHOULD therefore notice it is affected by known security issues
    and notify the user if a newer release fixes some.

And this is precisely what have been implemented, and it was the only reason to do this feed check on boot. Minimalistic stats come with it, but don't mean any risk for the user.

> reminds me of most Windows machines which hit Microsoft's time server(s)

I guess you're aware that some GNU/Linux distro do the same.

> please tell me how to disable this communication between my boot-up of Tails and the Tails server(s)

As explained previously, there is no way to do that appart from building yourself a custom ISO. No need to capitalize, we already understood your question.

> I don't need the program checking 

Tails is not developed for your usage only, so we won't diverge from our design, nor put other users at risk just for you. Maybe you are used to regulary check your distros' website for update, but from our experience it's not really the case usually. This is a way for us to educate people to check for security upgrades. Other than that a lot of people out there would continue to use broken Tails.

> I don't want any boot stats provided to you from my system

The only stat provided by your system is that it has booted, and the language used, and that's all.

> Please tell me how to disable all of that 

Already answered : you can't.

> Let's appear more open in our replies and to the point.

We replied to your point. Not the way you want probably, but that's not out off topic, sorry.
