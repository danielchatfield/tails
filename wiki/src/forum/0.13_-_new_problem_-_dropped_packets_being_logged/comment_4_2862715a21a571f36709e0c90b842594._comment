> thanks for the reporting link, but i've reported it here. please include it in your bug tracking and post the trac url here.

Actually if we ask for you to report to us using this tool is that it will send pretty usefull informations that will help us to better understand the issue.

Take care that if you do so, you might want to review the logs included in the \"technical details\" tab, you might want to remove some informations like your IP. This report will be sent to our private encrypted mailing list, so these informations won't leak anyway.
