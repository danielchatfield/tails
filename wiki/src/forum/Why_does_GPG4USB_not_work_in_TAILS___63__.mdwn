I installed GPG4USB onto my usb stick.

Works in windows.


But tails doesnt recognize the start linux launch button
and asks to open it with another programm....


How to make it work ?
Do I have to select a specific programm in Tails
to run it through it ?


Thx



(Tried to create a persistent volume in tails on usb but

it lacks uefi support so I cant do it with my 
3.0 Usb slots.)
