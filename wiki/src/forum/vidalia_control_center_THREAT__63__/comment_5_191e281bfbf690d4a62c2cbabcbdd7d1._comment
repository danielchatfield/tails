>>If it worries you, turn of JS and much of it will go away.

What is the mistake? OP refers to unwanted connections to a distinctive set of third party hosts. We haven't seen the problem page but couldn't those connections correspond to retrieving embedded scripts? 

>Completely turning off JS is generally not doable

I don't think I understand! Do you mean that after deselecting Iceweasel's \"Enable JavaScript\", embedded scripts will still be downloaded? Or that JS is still run? I didn't see any suggestion of those in the link. Or are you warning that disabling JS might not be wise for other reasons?.. \"fingerprinting\" etc?
