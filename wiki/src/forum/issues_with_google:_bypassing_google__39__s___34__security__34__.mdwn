If someone can provide a solution here I would be so pleased. As this is really annoying. The primary reason being: I cannot access my acccount.

The usage of Tor causes you to have a random ip address. Doing so causes google to detect you are logging in from a different ip address (location) everytime. Then google forces you to provide the city where you usually log in from. This of course is kind of diffcult to impossible to do. I suppose I could reset my password, but I am not sure if I would have to keep resetting it. Google states somewhere that it may disable your account also if it detects ususal activity. This is "security" for google, but to tor users it has to be just annoying. Any ideas, suggestions how to bypass this? I really like to use google.

Hope you guys can help :D
