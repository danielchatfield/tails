I followed the instructions "Installing onto a USB stick, for Windows". When I try to boot from  the USB I get the following:

*SYSLINUX 4.05 EDD 2011-12-09 Copyright (C) 1994-2011 H. Peter Anvin at al*

*No DEFAULT or UI configuration found!*

*boot:*

Anything I type in after the prompt boot: I get message:
 
*Could not find kernel image:*

Did I miss something?
