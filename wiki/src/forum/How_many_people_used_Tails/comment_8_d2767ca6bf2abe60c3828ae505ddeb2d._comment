> So you ship an auto-update check that's on by default, which you also use to track users.

Users tend to trust Tails more than other piece of software. We feel it is a duty to warn users that they are at risk. Tails being a live amnesic system, the notion of \"default settings\" does not really apply like it does to other systems.

But back to the point. Would you please explain how, in your view, this data track users?

Again, the only thing we have is \"at that time, this file on the server was accessed\". We have no IP addresses (connections go through Tor), no distinct software signature, no hardware informations, etc. Those requests could actually originate from something else than Tails systems, we would not be able to spot the difference.

If this check is tracking users, then what are requests to the Tor directory authorities?
