This number is an estimate given by the number of requests for the security news feed on the website. This feed is retrieved by the software used to warn users when they are using a version of Tails that is out of date regarding security issues.

This gives us no information whatsoever on Tails users. The only thing we know from this is *one instance of Tails has been booted somewhere and successfully connected to the Tor network*.
