If I were an NSA honeypot, (many believe truecrypt to be), I would promote the virtues of open source, well openly. I would be quietly confident in the difficulty of anyone finding... well anything except open source honey.  If i were an NSA honeypot I would avoid placing anything which may compromise my work in such high profile places like.... say TOR. I may realise that most bee's are unable to determine that tor is not, in itself secure and attack them easily. I would know that out of the few bee's aware of this fact only a tiny fraction of them are willing or have the ability to implement a solution themselves. I would put my honey pot right about........ HERE.   A nice place full of honey, which just happens to be the only place which is given a big sign post outside TOR, so no bees get lost. 

 I certainly wouldn't tell anyone about the honey over there, I would want all the bees to stay right HERE
