Hi. I'm run Tails from a bootable USB driveand it works great. I like that when I pull the thumb drive out of the USB port it immediately shuts down and wipes the RAM. But earlier it didn't.

I had Tails running last night and fell asleep with the computer on. In the morning I decided to use windoze to access the clearnet so I pulled the Tails USB and the computer didn't shut down. Tor was still on and I could still go to new sites, gedit still worked, the mouse still worked, etc. I got an error when going to Administration menu and clicking the power off icon. It asked if I wanted to delete an app. I shut down the computer by pressing and holding the power button til it shut off and then pressed the power button again and it booted into windows.

I tried to replicate this several times afterwards but Tails started up and shut down normally when removing the flash drive from the USB port.

I'm not sure if this is a bug or if the anomoly was caused when I left the computer running all night with Tails booted, but I'm reporting the incident here anyways just in case.

Thanks for all the work you guys are doing and providing us with this great software.
