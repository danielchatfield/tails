A while ago I was messing around with my wired ethernet card, when something weird happened. I connect to the internet using a DSL connection. For some reason I don't recall, I downed eth0 while still connected to the internet. I then tried to reload the webpage to see what would happen. I was expecting it to deliver an error, but, much to my surprise I was still on. I ran ifconfig -a and found out a new entry called eth0:9. I downed it and upped eth0 again and everything was fine again, but I wonder if I messed my ethernet card. Did this in anyway compromise my anonymity when using Tails? Should I get a new ethernet card?
