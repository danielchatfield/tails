If I save a .deb of some light-weight browser to be installed in times of necessity, would I then be able to bypass tor easily with it or would it need some specific configuration to work like a regular browser?

Ideally I would like a seperate secure browser that I could use for non tor stuff to be able to use tails as a more general live OS as well as for general anonymity. I already have a tails usb key on me so it's a shame that when I quickly need a linux I can't use it because the internet is locked down.

So, what methods are people currently using?
