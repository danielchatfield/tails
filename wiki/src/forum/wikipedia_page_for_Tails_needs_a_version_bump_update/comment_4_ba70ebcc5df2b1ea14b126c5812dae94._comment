\"Um, You do realize that wikipedia is user edited right? As in any user can edit pretty much any article without even registering. So why did you make a forum post about it when you could of just added the version number yourself, very easily without even having to register on wikipedia.\"

Because Wikipedia blocks tor exit nodes, clicking on 'Edit' there brings me to a 'View source' and a banned IP notice. I thought I'd bring this to your attention so you could correctly update the Wikipedia page.

But I'm met with a rotten tomato to the face. You're welcome.
