An honourable intention! You've actually made an effort to compile and present some potentially helpful information too!... so your heart's certainly in the right place. The forum really isn't a suitable place for this sort of thing though - have you thought of helping [improve the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/documentation/)?

Thanks for being kind enough to make an effort. Have a wonderful Christmas.
