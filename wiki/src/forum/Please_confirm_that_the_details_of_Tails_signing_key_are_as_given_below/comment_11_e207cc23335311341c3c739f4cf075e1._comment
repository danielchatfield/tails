... about the expired key.  I noticed that too and worried about it.  Fortunately for my piece of mind I eventually found it mentioned as a \"known issue\", and I know how to check a keyserver which showed that the expiration date had been extended.  So as far as we and the Tails devs know, that key remains secure.

I always try to check the SSL certificate to make sure that there is nothing to indicate that I am not connected to the genuine tails website when downloading something like an iso image, detached signature, or signing key.  And I try to check the authenticity of the signing key by downloading it from a key server too.  Simply asking on the forum (and I see the same information you posted) is not a bad idea either.  None of these methods are failsafe by any means but when used together they do provide some reason to think that you have obtained a genuine tails iso image.

I have encountered many bad certificates and invalid or expired signatures.  Almost always these turn out to result from human errors (someone forgot to renew a certificate, or to update a key).
