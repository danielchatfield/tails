I claim that this is the correct signing key fingerprint. However, instead of asking us here on the forum you could just [[download the signing key from the Tails website|doc/about/openpgp_keys]]. Both ways are equivalent in terms of security, which in these cases depend on HTTPS, which in its current state [is pretty far from perfect](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it).

Please have a look on our article about [[trusting Tails' signing key|doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key]].
