No doubt.

>There is a person on this forum who signs himself/herself as Tails. Moreover s/he posts frequently and regularly too. 

That'll be \"the devs\" ;o)

>If s/he confirms the fingerprint that I posted earlier as correct, then I would trust the signature file.

This wouldn't have been supposed to be some sort of bear trap perchance? X))

>I based the above assumption that this forum has not been hacked.

The forum has not \"been hacked\". It has also never been presented as a cryptographically secure authentication channel. It is a forum! \"The devs\" have already been good enough to write a long and comprehensive page describing several methods by which you may *correctly* verify a signing key. I'm sure it must be invaluable to those who don't know and cant work out how to verify the authenticity of a pgp key themselves. Perhaps you should refer to it:
