Thanks very much for your confirmation.

>However, instead of asking us here on the forum you could just download the signing key from the Tails website.

I downloaded it 3 times and each time, Gpg4win stated that the key had expired. This, in spite of the fact that a Tails developer affirmed that s/he had updated the Tails-signing key on Tails' download page.

In the end I had no choice but to obtain the Tails' signing key from one of its key-servers using Kleopatra. This key is still valid (i.e. not expired).

That is why I asked on this forum for the Tails developer's confirmation of the fingerprint of the key that I downloaded from a key-server via Kleopatra.

I hope the above background helps you guys to understand why I posted the original request.
