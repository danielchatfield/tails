Unless Runa S were traveling igconito, using a false passport sufficiently convincing to get him past the border, the Chinese government is certainly capable of guessing that Runa S might be doing inside China, even if he took the obvious precaution of not bringing a physical copy of Tails with him.  If so, they'd follow him and almost certainly arrest him in some \"subversive act\".  The nicest thing which could happen after that is a quick deportation.
