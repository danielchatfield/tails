I agree that all journalists should know how to use GPG, Tor, Tails, I2P, Freenet, and Truecrypt.  
  
I would rather you taught Kurdish journalists or activists instead of their Turkish counterparts! Even though many journalists do not advocate the oppressive Gov policies against the Kurdish minority, the Kurds are the ones that need anonymity...

Most if not all Turkish journalists have a strong loyalty to their so called Ottoman-Empire history and to this day deny all their atrocities against Kurds and Armenians. Nazi Germany paid for their crimes against the Jews, but the Turks still practice oppression to this day.  
  
Just my 2 cents
