> IS it possible for Admins to read CPUID of Tails users browsing their websites?

None that know of.

> Is there any difference between reading the CPUID of Intel chipsets and AMD chipsets?

No idea.

Yes: audit Tails, investigate, find ways to make this data leak remotely, report back, suggest fixes if needed.
