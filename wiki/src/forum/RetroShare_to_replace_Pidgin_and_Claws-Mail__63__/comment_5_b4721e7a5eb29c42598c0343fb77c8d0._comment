That is not an official Debian package and in that sense it won't benefit from the many advantages of a real inclusion in Debian, which makes it otherwise non-sustainable for us to include such packages:

  - be under the scrutiny of the Debian community
  - provide OpenPGP signed packages
  - follow the Debian process for security updates and new versions

But if Retroshare already proposes a non-official Debian package, maybe they are not so far from having it into Debian. You could check with them if that is in their plan.
