> You also appear to claim that there are many safe and anonymous avenues for setting up a privacy forum where unregistered users can post questions and comments.

> This begs the question: if you are that annoyed (and I believe you are), and it is that safe and easy, why not set up the missing forum yourself?

No need for. Hackbb is ok for this. What do you miss?

I don't care if bad guys are reading it or even run by bad guys. This will always happen with any open public place.

The fraudsters, botnet owners and drug sellers are safely using it. And you are scared to get caught because of a few basic Tails and general Tor and privacy questions?

You can alternative ask the friendly Administrator of [tor status net](http://lotjbov3gzzf23hc.onion/) if he sets up a forum. He runs lots of services already. Onion wiki, hosting, status net, his blog.
