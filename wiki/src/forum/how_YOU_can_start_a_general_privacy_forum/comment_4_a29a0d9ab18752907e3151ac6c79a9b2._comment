OP, I just went to your first suggested alternative (onion forum) to discussing Tails and related issues here on the Tails forum. And I was the one and ONLY PERSON ONLINE! 

And besides the extreme low activity of this forum that was FAR too low to keep a serious ongoing discussion going. It was also almost completely about unrelated things, such as \"deaf asian girlfriend\", \"how to poison someone\" and other things I won't even mention. 

You are one of the people trying to get Tails users to go discuss their issues related to the software elsewhere, claiming there are many alternatives, and then suggest THAT? 

It is just becoming more clear all the time that until someone makes a dedicated forum for discussing Tails users particular issues, you are just going to have to deal with seeing some (in your opinion) less than directly related threads sometimes.

There simply is not at this time any better place for us. And certainly not what you suggested, as made clear above.
