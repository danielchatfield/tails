there is a privacy subreddit at http://reddit.com/r/privacy where people share general privacy-related articles. Not much specialist or techincal info there though, perhaps someone could register another subreddit focused more on techical aspects of privacy and anonymity (tor, tails, liberte, linux etcetera)?
