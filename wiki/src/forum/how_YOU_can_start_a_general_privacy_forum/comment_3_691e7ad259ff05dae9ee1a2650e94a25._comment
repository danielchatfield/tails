@ OP:

You say

> I am annoyed by same same people keeping on asking for a general privacy forum.

You also appear to claim that there are many safe and anonymous avenues for setting up a privacy forum where unregistered users can post questions and comments.

This begs the question: if you are that annoyed (and I believe you are), and it is that safe and easy, why not set up the missing forum yourself?
