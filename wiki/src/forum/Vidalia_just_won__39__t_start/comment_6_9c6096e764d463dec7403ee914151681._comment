Bridge report:

From Vidalia message log:
Learned fingerprint for bridge A
Bootstrapped 15%
Learned fingerprint for bridge B
Bootstrapped 20%: asking for networkstatus consensus
Bootstrapped 50%: loading relay descriptors.
New bridge descriptor
I learned some more information, but not enough to build a circuit. No usable consensus.

I'll be trying with obfuscated bridges next.
