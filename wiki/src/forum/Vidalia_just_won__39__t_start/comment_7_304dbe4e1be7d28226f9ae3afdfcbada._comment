Tried using obfuscated bridges but nothing happens.
After enabling bridges in the boot menu, I add something like 1.2.3.4:1051 to the bridges directory, but it doesn&t work. Also, Vidalia tells me it hasn't enough permission to edit torrc.

Tor is working fine on Liberte Linux, by the way. Even without using bridges.
