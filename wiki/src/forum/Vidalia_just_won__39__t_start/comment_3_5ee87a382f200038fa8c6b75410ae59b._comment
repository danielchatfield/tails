Okay, so I managed to get Tails 0.16 to connect to the Tor network. I unplugged my computer and modem and waited approximately 30 minutes before booting Tails and it worked. 

Unfortunately, I tried doing the same thing again a couple of minutes ago and it's no longer working.

In the shutdown page I get \"currently running processes\" and then a list of processes, among which su---vidalia-warapper---sleep. Then I get \"killing all remaining processes\" with the message \"FAILED\".
