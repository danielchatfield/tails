>> Please report a complete bug.

I'd love to, but as it happens I don't have an e-mail account. I tried Yahoo!, Google, Hotmail and Fastmail, but all to no avail. I thought about using Tormail, but I'm not really sure I trust them.

So, and while I know this forum isn't the right place to be posting bug information, would you be kind enough to let me post the bug description here?

I downloaded the ISO for the latest version of Tails a couple of days after it came out in mid-January. Ever since doing that I've browsed the web on numerous occasions using Tails 0.16, without any major complications. 

I connect to the internet using a DSL connection, so my basic routine when starting Tails is to choose 'forward' in the Tails greeter, choose a password (this was before I learned it's better not to set any password at all), enable Windows XP mode, edit network connections, connect to DSL connection 1 and wait for the Vidalia icon to pop-up and for Iceweasel to start. It just happens that, this time, the Vidalia icon either doesn't show up at all, or it fails to turn green. I opened up the control panel and it was stuck in the 'acquiring relay information' stage.

One thing I noticed, though, is that when I shutdown Tails I get a message (after clicking shutdown, in the black screen that comes before RAM wiping) saying something like \"killing running processes\" and it says something about the Vidalia wrapper being in sleep mode or something like that.
