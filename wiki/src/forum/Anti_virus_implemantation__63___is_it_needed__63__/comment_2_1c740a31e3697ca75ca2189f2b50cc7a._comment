> do we need some sort of security implemenation like an anti virus or anti malware?

Anti-virus software is the wrong solution for preventing malware. The signatures are by definition one step behind, and black lists are generally not a good solution for anything security related. We're better off implementing something more pro-active like [[todo/Mandatory_Access_Control]], which is already planned and worked upon.

A *running* Tails session can still be compromised (i.e. the malware lives in the RAM only). The malware will vanish once Tails is shutdown, but until that moment Tails is completely compromised.
