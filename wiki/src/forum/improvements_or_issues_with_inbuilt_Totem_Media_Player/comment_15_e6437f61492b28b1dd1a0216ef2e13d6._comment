Avoid crappy dumbed-down Gnome utilities like media player and the awful Nautilus.  Install Gnome Commander (itself buggy).  Get mplayer-nogui and w32codecs from the independent Debian Multimedia repo and use it from the command line.  I don't know about YouTube for OP but that will play any media format and codec known to humans.
