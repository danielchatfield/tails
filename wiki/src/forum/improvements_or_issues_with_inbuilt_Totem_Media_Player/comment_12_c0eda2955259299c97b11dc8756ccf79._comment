It is obnoxious comments like that ruin this project.

Why even bother to post ???

Most people come here from the windows version and not helping newbies will stop them making a donation to the project.

And don't post something ridiculous about reading the manual as a new user can no more get an answer than someone trying to learn a foreign language from reading a
foreign dictionary.
