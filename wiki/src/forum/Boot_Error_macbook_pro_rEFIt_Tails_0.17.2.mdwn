Thank you for the update today.  However upon uploading the new Tails update to my USB, when booting on a macbook pro using rEFIt a black screen appears with Boot Error.  

I have tried installing using Universal USB installer and the Tails installer within Tails, however every time I get Boot Error.  Do you have any suggestions?

Thank You!
