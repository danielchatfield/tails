>The above post (the first reply) is an example of a post that would appear to be from a TAILS dev, but is not signed as such.

Doesn't look like a developer's comment to me. They are usually signed \"Tails\". Any unsigned comments should be attributed to an *anonymous* community member. On what are you basing this assumption?

>Was this actually a TAILS dev?

Who knows... it is *anonymous*!!!

>If so, did they simply forget to sign the post as \"TAILS\"?

I've *never* seen a comment purporting to be by a developer go unsigned. Could happen I suppose but I've never seen it and I'm sure it's not the case here.
