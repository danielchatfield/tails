Personally I find little value (you haven't *explained* your suggestions yet, so I can only guess) in most of the ideas.

The one which stands out to me as having *some* potential value is rootkit detection. Obviously this would be of no value on a compromised system against a tailored Tails attack... but *might* be of *some* interest against more generic code - perhaps the sort of stuff the recording industry might have installed onto your windows box? Somewhat tangential for Tails though... did you have any particular case in mind?
