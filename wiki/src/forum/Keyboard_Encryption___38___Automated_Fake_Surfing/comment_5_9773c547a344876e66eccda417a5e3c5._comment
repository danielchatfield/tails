I think the idea of fake surfing is interesting. I have been doing
this for a couple of months now using the w3m browser, a bash script
and a data file full of weird offbeat links. The script selects a
random link at a random time and works in the background.

The purpose is not to increase security but to annoy the security
services in my country who unfortunately have the right to profile me
by logging all my internet access.

If they are bothering to profile me they probably think that I am a
fluent Russian speaking hang-glider pilot who suffers from acne,
cystitis and dementia, and has a fondness for twinkies and Peruvian
cuisine.  Good luck to them.
