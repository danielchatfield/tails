Keyscrambler is designed to confuse keyloggers, but I can't see how
keyloggers can get installed on a system running a live DVD so it
seems irrelevant to this distro.

The fake surfing would surely need some sort of scripting which
could make the browser vulnerable to malicious scripts. The free
version of iMacros couldn't do this satisfactorily (though the $500
business version probably could).

The automated keypresses, clicks, mouse movements and white noise
could be hilarious and would keep the developers busy as some of
Tails' more unstable users flood the forum with reports of poltergeist
attacks.

Lastly, rkhunter and chrootkit are for installed distros not live DVDs.

(p.s. I think the author of comment 2 is a Tails developer having a laugh).
