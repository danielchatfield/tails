hello, i have an issue using tail on a dell laptop
vostro 3555 (amd A6 fusion quad core 3400)

boot is working ok but i have a totally black screen 
after finishing (seing the blinking led on the usb key)

i think it is an issue with graphics because if i go (blind typing) in a console with ctrl-alt-f1, and typing sudo su then reboot, then the computer seems to go down
even if not shuting down cleanly (have to hard reboot)

as i don't know what to do about that (cheatcodes ? where to find them ? about memory, screen, etc...?) i am unable to use tor on that laptop

thanks for suggestions
