 So, how does one use Bitcoin with Tails? The few postings in the forum on the subject of bitcoin mention installing a client into a persistent direcory. 
 Launching the supplied Synaptic package manager and searching for bitcoin, only bitcoind is available. I've installed it. Now what? Don't I need a bitcoin client?
Where is it? 
 Btw, I've seen some error messages while installing bitcoind, where are they logged?
 It's strange that bitcoin is not preinstalled on Tails. 
It's hard to find a USB drive less than 4GB at local retailers , here in LA, I suppose similar situation elsewhere, so the argument that bitcoin with the database is too large to include in a distro, seems unreasonable.
