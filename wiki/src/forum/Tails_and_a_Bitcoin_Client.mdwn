Ok, relatively new to the whole process here, but I am trying to setup a Tails system that can use a Bitcoin client, but am having some trouble with using the persistent volume to load the block chain into. Can someone give me a step by step process for installing a Bitcoin client onto a Persistent Volume in Tails? Beginning user instruction level ;)
