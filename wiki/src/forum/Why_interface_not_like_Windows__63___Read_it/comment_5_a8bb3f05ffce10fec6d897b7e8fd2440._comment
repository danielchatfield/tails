>>I don't know how to operate linux kinda operating system because everyone worldwide is comfortable using MS Windows.

I *KNOW* this bizarre assertion to be false. Therefore everything else you said, based on it, is invalid. How do I *KNOW* it is untrue? Because *I* neither like, nor trust The Microsoft Corporation and am certainly not \"comfortable\" using its software. I suspect, though have never sought to prove, that I am not unique in this regard.

>>    I can't understand the commands and the Tails Admins have to waste a lot of time in replying to our queries because such operating systems are alien to us.

Don't worry. Not everyone on this forum, wasting their time replying to your messages, is a \"Tails admin\".

>>    World's most of the creative projects have originated from linux developers but why haven't they been able to simply everything like Microsoft Windows?

Sophisticated problems, such as counter-espionage (which is effectively what Tails is primarily about) are, erm... sophisticated.

Why not stick with Windows/IE? You could even take your chances with relatively sensitive tasks like online banking. Millions do just that... every day... some even get away with it for ages without being pwned! No-one's taking Windows from you.
