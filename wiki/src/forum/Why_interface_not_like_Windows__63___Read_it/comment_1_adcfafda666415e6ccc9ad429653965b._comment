> I can't understand the commands and the Tails Admins have to waste a lot of time in replying to our queries because such operating systems are alien to us.

In normal operation there shouldn't be any need for the command-line. What exactly are you trying to do?

> World's most of the creative projects have originated from linux developers but why haven't they been able to simply everything like Microsoft Windows?

In order to be helpful, please tell us specifically what it is you find so hard to do in Tails, and what is lacking in our documentation.

> It puts a lot of strain to our eyes because the websites don't appear using same fonts as we see while using browsers in windows.

As far as I know we can't include any Microsoft fonts in Tails even if we wanted to due to copyright restrictions.

> Today i learnt the persistent mode, but I could not make my browser addons persistent. I have to install all-in-one addon package (containing 32 addons) and bookmarks everytime.

We don't want to support persistent Iceweasel addons for the simple reason that many addons are not safe. Also, to make persistent addons sensible the Iceweasel settings would have to be persistent as well. That would make configuration updates in future Tails versions an almost impossible task.

> I suggest you: 1. Convert the interface of linux/tails to that of Windows.

We are just a few people working on this, and we certainly do not have the resources to do this. We are limited to use other Free Software projects and make the best of that situation.

I'm unsure, but you may be interested in Tails' [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/windows_camouflage]] (the next Tails version will make it much easier to enable this option).

> In place of persistence system as you have developed now, it would be better if you start using persistence of whole computer by protecting it like truecrypt. I mean, PASSWORD-1 will oepn fresh copy of TAils (without persistence) and PASSWORD-2 will open hidden/persistent edition of our TAILS.

This would imply the same upgrade issue as I described above for Iceweasel addons, but on a system wide scale.
