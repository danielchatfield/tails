Gosh OP, liquid-lunch time at Redmond again? Sounds like you're all jolly well oiled over there - your syntax is making *me* feel quite woozy! hic

Thanks for dropping in to give us all a good laugh. I'd say you're just about ready to go off and spend a pleasurable afternoon generating \"security\" certificates for Windows(tm) Update(tm) / NSA / Mossad.

All the best.
