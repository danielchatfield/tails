I get to the very end of creating the bootable and I get the following message:  

Installation Failed - An uncaught exception was raised: Invalid version string 'GNU/Linux'

I'm using 'startup disk creator' on Ubuntu 12.04.  A search on the web found this:

Could the lack of quotes in the Tails version string be the issue?
