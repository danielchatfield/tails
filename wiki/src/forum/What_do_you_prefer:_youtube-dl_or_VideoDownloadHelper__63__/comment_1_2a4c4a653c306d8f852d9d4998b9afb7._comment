This isn't an answer to your question but a note that Video DownloadHelper sets a cookie that can be seen like other browser cookies. This can be disabled in preferences / General / Behavior tab. 

(Instructions to disable the cookie should be added to the documentation at [[Flash support|todo/Flash_support/]]. I can't change that page due to spam protection assuming I am adding the links that are already there.)

More about the cookie:

<http://www.downloadhelper.net/faq.php#download-counter>

>I see on the www.downloadhelper.net site the number of downloads I did. Does it mean DownloadHelper keeps track of my downloads ?

>No, the extension only increments a counter at the end of each download. This counter is passed as a cookie to the www.downloadhelper.net site, so this value can be displayed.

>This cookie can be disabled from the preferences, by checking parameter Disable download count cookie.
