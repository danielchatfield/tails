do you mean [this?](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-youtube-video-downl-10137/?src=search)

I'd prefer it over VideoDownloadHelper since it's open source, but how does it work?! Can't see neither menu nor button after installation.

Is it safe with Tails?

There should be a tool for Tails!
