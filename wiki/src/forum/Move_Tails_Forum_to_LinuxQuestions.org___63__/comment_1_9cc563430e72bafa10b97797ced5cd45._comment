I'm not a Tails developer but I can tell you that the likelihood of that ever happening is about 0%.

This forum is certainly not perfect but at least it's hosted on the Tails own website which is quite essential for an official forum, also an important part of the reason why this forum system is used is because it allows you to post without having to create any account, the forum you link to, like most forums do not allow that.
