thanks for your support!
When I start the pc is as if there were no pen drive, not only recognizes it if I create with tails usb istaller, if I create the pen drive with another software (Universal-USB-Installer) then it works without problems. But then I can not create the volume of persistence. Even if I burn on dvd works without problems.

My pc is a alienware x51
