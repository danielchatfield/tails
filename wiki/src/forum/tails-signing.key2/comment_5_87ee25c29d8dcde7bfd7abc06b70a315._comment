you say tails signing.key was not modified - but usually the file is about 6.9 kb and the new one is about 20 kb. 

When doing a 256 sha sum together with older keys you can clearly see the difference of this new key.

Did the volume of the keyfile grow because of the new signatures and that created a new checksum ?
So that would mean this method of trust would restart at every new signing process.
