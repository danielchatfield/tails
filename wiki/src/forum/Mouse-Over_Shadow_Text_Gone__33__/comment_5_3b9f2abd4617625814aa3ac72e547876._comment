I don't think this bug was formally tracked. It's been inherited from Torbutton and updating it to 1.5 solved the issue.

> Also, how about adding some text to the WhisperBack form, giving some idea of how much time should be allowed for a bug report to be evaluated and acknowledged?

What do you mean by that? Indicating a maximum time before we answer the bug report? We are mostly working as volunteers so I'm not sure we are ready to do that. The time we take to answer a bug report greatly depends on how busy we are with Tails and other things...
