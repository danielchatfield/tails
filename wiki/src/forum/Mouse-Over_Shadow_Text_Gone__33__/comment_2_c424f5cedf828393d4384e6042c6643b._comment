Would a Tails dev kindly respond to both questions: The mouse-over bug and last week's forum bugs.

I realize you are all likely busy but I'm sure you can understand that not receiving any response this way is quite unnerving.

Regarding bug reporting, please note that I found no information about how much time one should allow after submitting a report before seeing it acknowledged. I would like to suggest that you correct by this by simply adding such info to the relevant pages.

It has now been close to two weeks, I believe, since I submitted the bug report via WhisperBack (referenced in the OP). Perhaps this is still within the normal frame of time but I have no way of knowing.

Thank you for your continued work.
