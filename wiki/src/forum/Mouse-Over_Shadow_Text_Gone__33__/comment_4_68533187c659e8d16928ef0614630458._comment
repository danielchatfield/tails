@Tails: Thank you for replying.

Is this bug listed anywhere?

Before filing my bug report via WhisperBack, I had searched both the list of known bugs as well as the Tails dev list archives for at least the months of March and April. I found nothing that I could recognize as addressing the bug in question.

Also, how about adding some text to the WhisperBack form, giving some idea of how much time should be allowed for a bug report to be evaluated and acknowledged? 

Thanks again.
