It is indeed great to see persistence option available for bookmarks. Due to it, all of us may start using only TAILS and shun windows forever. Actually earlier it was quite irritating to restore bookmarks on every restart, but now we can copy our bookmarks.

We wish the Tails team to develope following new functions:

1. We desire atleast 4 nodes and that too all from different countries so as to ensure more security/anonymity. Someone said that in order to trace one person, the investigative agencies need to verify the data from 5000x5000 TOR users. So if one more node is provided, then the equation will become 5000x5000x5000 (assuming that 5000 people are connected to that particular node).

2. Kindly introduce new persistence feature for addons too.

If this is not possible for the time being, give us the links to learn the wireshark to check if the IP address is being leaked by an addon.

I recently checked a forked out tool Advanced TOR. I was quite impressed from a few features (simplicity to add bridges, proxies and define the no. of nodes we want) but since it is being run by only one person named Vektor and has no dedicated Tails team, we are afraid of using it.
