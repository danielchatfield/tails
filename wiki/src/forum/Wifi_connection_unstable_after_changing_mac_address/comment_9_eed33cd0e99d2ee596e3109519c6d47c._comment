Same problem here.  I know that it is not my pc, network card, isp, or any other issue.  I am completely ceatain that it is an issue with Tails.  Unfortunatly for me, I think the whole issue with my mac being leaked is already to late.  I pray for the day that a dev could fix the issue so I can dispose of my laptop and get a new one with a different mac, and never let that one leak!
