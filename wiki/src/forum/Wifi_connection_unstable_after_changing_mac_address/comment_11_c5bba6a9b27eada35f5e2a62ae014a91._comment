OP again. I sent a complete bug report via Whisperback after leaving my last comment. I included an email address but haven't heard back yet. I do hope this is resolved soon, one way or the other.

I appreciate this wonderful (and free!) product that the Tails developers are donating their time on. Thanks for all that you do, even if I'm unable to reliably change my MAC right now. ;)
