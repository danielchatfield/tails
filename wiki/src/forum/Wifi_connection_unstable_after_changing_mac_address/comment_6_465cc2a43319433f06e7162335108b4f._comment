I change my mac all the time with other distros and it always works just fine.  This is the same macchanger with the same commands.  I was going to, although have not yet, downloaded debian live and try to do it with that distro and see if it works.  I would like to see others change their mac and connect to a network and let us know how it went.  My guess is that it would be the same problems.
