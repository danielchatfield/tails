I wonder if this is not a technical problem at your end, but a kind of misunderstanding, in which robomonitoring software used by your WiFi provider (or more likely, a surveillance company they have hired) is mistaking you for someone trying to steal WiFi service by pretending to be a legitimate customer (yourself), instead of a legitimate customer trying to avoid being tracked all over the web.
