OP again. This appears to have remedied the problem. I'm actually embarrassed that I didn't think to do that. I've only been testing the connection for 5 minutes, so it may be too soon to say for sure, but I think we have the solution here.

Any others that have been having this problem - can you confirm that this procedure fixes the problem?
