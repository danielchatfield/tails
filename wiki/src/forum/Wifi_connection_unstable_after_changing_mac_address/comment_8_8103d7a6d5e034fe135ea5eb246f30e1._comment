Original poster here - I always disconnect from all networks before changing the mac address. so that isn't the problem. 

I'm not screwing up the mac changing process, either: 

# ifconfig wlan0 down
# macchanger wlan0 -e
# ifconfig wlan0 up

This issue remains consistent across the two Tails versions I've used (0.13 and 0.16). After changing my mac address in 0.16, I am not able to connect to secured networks at all. I am asked repeatedly for the password without ever succeeding in connecting. Strangely, I am able to connect to unsecured networks just fine. 

I am not sure if this is a Tails bug or if it's user error. In any case, a solution would be much appreciated.
