This continues to work for me w/ my mobile broadband USB & MiFi device 

I wouldn't recommend attempting this on the fly as you may be rejoining old relays with a newly assigned MAC address. If your destination is similiar to the last you joined under your former MAC address, fingerprinting could be developed. 

Since I own both of my mobile broadband devices I do not stop the network manager I turn off/disconnect my network peripheral devices. So to be clear, I don't stop the network manager by command physically remove my USB devie and or turn off my mobile hotspot during this process. Furthermore I used the RFkill command to disable all other unwanted network connecting devices bluetooth etc.

This is helpful if you have a static ISP device w/Tails.

So,if persistance has been enabled w/ your password continue.

In console type: 

sudo mac-randomize all
when asked,enter your password
confim and exit

Then connect your device again.

If no persistance follow the earlier echo post but instead of typing each wlan just enter

sudo mac-randomize all

that will do the same thing less typing.
sudo mac-randomize all
