Replacing NetworkManager with wicd, in current Tails, disables many important parts of Tails. After you've done that, you are on you own.

Anyway, back to pristine Tails: I suggest disabling the network connection in the NM applet, then running macchanger, then enabling the network connection again.

If this does not help, and you still think it's a bug in Tails, then... please [[report a complete bug|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]].
