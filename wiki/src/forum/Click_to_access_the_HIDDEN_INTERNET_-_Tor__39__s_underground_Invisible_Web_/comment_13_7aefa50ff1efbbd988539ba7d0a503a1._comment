Not speaking for Tails devs, however I do not think it should be a goal of Tails to teach people about the moral, political and philosophical pros/cons of anonymous publishing or about the content of hidden sites, and I don't think it ever should be.  There are plenty of more appropriate places on the web where people can have that discussion.  It's a bore anyway and has been done to death elsewhere.  

The simple upshot is always the same: there can be no such thing as anonymous publishing once filters of any sort are built into Tor, which means we all have to just grow up and accept that there's stuff out there we won't like.  So shut up, don't look at it, and don't tell people about it. All you are doing is advertising it, which I think may have been the objective.  

And it's not that stuff that really gets governments regulating to track you, whatever they say.  They just want more control. \"Think of the children\" is the oldest political manipulation in the book, apart from drumming up a common unseen enemy. For example: terrorists (you're more likely to die any other way than in a terrorist attack),  \"reds under the bed\" in the 1950s,  and now a dread of pedophiles that is totally out of touch with all reality.  On that last point, a study in South Australia showed that even qualified human service professionals (doctors, nurses, psychologists etc) had a very distorted view of pedophilia, greatly overestimating both the extent of abuse and the damage that was assumed to result. In other words, psychologists and social workers in one of the world's most advanced and allegedly \"free\" countries are getting most of their attitudes from the gutter press instead of from actual research!   Great, heh?

Governments want \"free\" speech on *their* terms.  Look at what's happened in Syria and dozens of countries.  Look at the frequent political attempt to legislate for content filtering (which cannot work) in numerous supposed democracies like the UK and Australia. Tor is critical for people everywhere.

So please grow a brain people.  Use google if you want more information and to debate this.
