> just lots of observations that the \"anonymous internet publishing\" produces, almost exclusively, excrement

yes anonymous i agree your internet publishment is exclusively excrement, but to say hidden services is excrement is like saying the world wide web is excrement. I would say, oh really, that's a big statement, start at the very first document every published and list until you get to the last. What do i hear? That you will never do it because the information is vast and cannot possibly be catalogued let alone given excrement ratings by our learned anonymous expert. It does not matter what percentage of things on the internet (or hidden services for that matter) are worthy, but that there are things there which are useful to some people and that the forum exists to promote them 

I for one do not wish to live in a world where \"useful\" is defined by jo anonymous in the last blog or by some upstart chinese official who had relations with chairman mao and was promoted to the board of censorship and other stupidities commitee. 

But even if we agree that hard working young chinese students shouldn't be censored by promiscuous upstart chinese officials what are we to do about it?

I know, I know sais the eager young student, lets create a place where fornicating upstarts can't control what content I need to value the price of tea in China. Then I get filthy rich like all foreign devils in barbarian land  

very good my young student, you just won the gold prize. You don't have to sleep with an official today. Lucky for you there is a place called hidden services.  And never let anyone tell you have to bend over just to get the truth. its the truth, off you go little one


Lets sum up for those who favour censoring hidden services 

Rule 1
**Anyone who tells you censorship is good is trying to tell you that their level of censorship is good. Sounds like an agenda to me. **

Rule 2
**Hiding something is the same as censoring it**

Those like anonymous who tell you that we should 
>obscure section of Tails related warnings and caveats.

are just telling you that we should censor 

 The information is either found or it is not. Weather the information cant be found in an obscure corner or because its locked away makes no difference. The proverbial chinese student gets bent over either way and its called CENSORSHIP

Rule 3-100000000
**The only level of censorship needed is for the discerning mind to distinguish the truth **
