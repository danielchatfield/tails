>The simple upshot is always the same: there can be no such thing as anonymous publishing once filters of any sort are built into Tor, which means we all have to just grow up and accept that there's stuff out there we won't like. So shut up, don't look at it, and don't tell people about it. All you are doing is advertising it, which I think may have been the objective.

Lol of course its been advertised. Tor advertises it on its website too. Hidden Services is just like the WWW. Not good or bad, just a medium. The WWW is full of bad stuff too, but no I won't shut up about it because the WWW is what the whole world uses, and Hidden Services or perhaps I2P will become world wide too. People had these same discussions and fears when the internet first came out. It will blow over and then people will realise what an amazing system it really can be. 

>So please grow a brain people. Use google if you want more information and to debate this.

I'm sure they said something along the lines of people grow a brain, if you want more information about this thing called the \"INTERNET\" and to debate this evil INTERNET, read a book or join a club, don't go online, its evil! 

Hidden Services is no more harmful than the world wide web, just better and more powerful
