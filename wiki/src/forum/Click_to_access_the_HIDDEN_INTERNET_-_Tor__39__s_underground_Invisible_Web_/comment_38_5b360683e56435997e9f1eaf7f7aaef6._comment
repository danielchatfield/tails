>In the United States, physicians are prosecuted for providing the drugs necessary to alleviate their terminally-ill patients' excrutiating misery. (Marijuana, in some cases, sufficient morphine, in others, etc.)

>This is just one example but it happens to be one particularly relevant with regard to Tor hidden services. One of the known uses of \".onion\" sites is the trade and distribution of illegal drugs...

Just remember that the drugs listed, like marijuana are not illegal in all places. There exist many states which allow the sale and use of these medicines. 

Unfortunately if any attempt is made to open an internet site which provides these they are quickly shut down. Countries like the United States consider these web sites as possible suppliers to their territories and therefore remove them. They do this without consideration for the rights of people in other countries to make laws and govern themselves in the way which they see fit. 

The end result is that people are deprived of medicines which can alleviate the suffering of terminally ill patients who have broken no law. 

This is where Hidden Services comes in. It states clearly on the.onion site of Silk Road that everyone should obey the laws of their country or state before purchasing . It is their right to provide these services, and .onion gives them the ability to do so legally
