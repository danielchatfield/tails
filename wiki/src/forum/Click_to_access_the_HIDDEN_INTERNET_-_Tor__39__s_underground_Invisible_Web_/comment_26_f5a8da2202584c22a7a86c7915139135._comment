>There are various treaties and conventions which safeguard the most vulnerable members of society and the most fundamental necessities of human rights

Yes I think we can all agree that its important when we use hidden services not to make any comments in forums or on any of the sites which would adversely effect human rights. If you come across any statements made which may have this effect then I suggest to avoid them or post a warning that there is an article which may be offensive.

Thank you for pointing this out to us, I think we are all glad to be informed of any ways in which we can be more considerate online. 

I hope we can get as much information as we can on how we can safely and ethically  use hidden services for the promotion of human rights and freedom of speech
