The Tor network is an extremely valuable anti-oppression tool but its hidden sites are its squalid underbelly and best left hidden. If any mention need be made, it should be a comprehensive description and WARNING on a dedicated page found only from an obscure section of Tails related warnings and caveats.

    Hidden services is a valuable part of Tor and I think under promoted by Tails at this point

Hidden services are about as \"valuable\" and \"under-promoted\" as taking a wrong turn while shopping on \"Main Street\" and finding yourself on \"skid row\".

>I find it Hilarious that so many people are so passionately against anonymous internet publishing on a website dedicated to TOR.

I haven't seen a single comment argue \"against anonymous internet publishing\" in this thread... just lots of observations that the \"anonymous internet publishing\" produces, almost exclusively, excrement. Furthermore, for Tails to promote excrement would reflect badly on Tails as a whole and therefore be counter-productive. Perhaps you should put the feigned indignation to one side for a moment and brush up on your comprehension skills.

>Any argument against hidden services is an argument against TOR and against anonymity.

No it isn't. One *can* easily make a compelling argument that the .onion network is of no value whatsoever to humanity and represents a damaging carbuncle on the arse of the otherwise honourable Tor project ...and ...as such is likely to do nothing more than incur the wrath of the moral majority and their (and *your*) political lords and masters ...and should therefore be excised as a matter of urgency for the greater good of Tor. However no such an argument has(/had) been presented here.
