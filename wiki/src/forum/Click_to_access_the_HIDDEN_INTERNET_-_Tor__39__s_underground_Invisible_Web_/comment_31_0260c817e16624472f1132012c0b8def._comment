>There are various treaties and conventions which safeguard the most vulnerable members of society and the most fundamental necessities of human rights

In the case of \"child pornography\" (\"CP\"), I'm afraid that to a large extent at least, the laws and the way they are enforced actually cause more harm than good. 

Limited, already-strained resources that could be spent pursuing people who harm *actual children* are instead spent hunting people who merely *view* and *posssess* **IMAGES**. (Images which, it must be noted, span quite a range. From truly horific, at one end, to rather innocous (e.g., mere *nudity*), at the other. In between these extremes lie considerable areas of varying shades of grey, subject to a great deal of debate. Mores and sensibilities vary greatly between cultures and societies in this highly sensitive area.)

Furthermore, the severe penalties that mere posession or even viewing of such material carries can, in many cases, deter essential evidence and witnesses from being brought forth. 

As the late Justice Louis Brandeis famously said, *\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant\"*.
 
I have personal experience that supports this. 

An individual who had preyed-upon children for years, leaving many victims in his wake, is now finally locked away. 

This was a direct result of action I had taken after coming across certain images and text at a certain rather unsavory location on the internet. No, this wasn't quite \"Onionland\" (i.e., .onion; Tor Hidden Services) but it wasn't that far from it. The site where I had seen the evidence that led to the tracking and, ultimately, conviction of a true predator was a site that worked vigilantly to just barely maintain a claim of legality. The content spanned a wide range, from completely innocent-- at one end, to decidely unsavory, blatantly provocative and downright tawdry -- at the other. (But not quite explicitly, obvious \"CP\" or even \"child nudity\"...which brings up another point: A great deal, if not the majority, of the \"modeling\" and similar photos that abounded on said site were *far* less innocent and wholesome than mere *nudity*. This was because in order for said site to be able to maintain that barest veneer of legality that allowed them to stay just barely above \"the underweb\" (a.k.a. \"darknet\", \"deep net\", \"onionland\", etc.), said site had to vigilantly enforce a strict \"no nudity\" rule...which brings us to yet another area in which the prevailing legal and social framework/paradigm/approach in this highly-charged area is riddled with paradox, irony and hypocrisy and is, ultimately, self-defeating --  assuming, that is, that the *stated* purposes and goals are the *actual* ones...) 

My point in relating this story is that the extreme stigma and risks (social as well as legal) involved in being associated in any way with the site and material in question could have very easily prevented the actions that I and others took, without which the positive outcome that ensued could not have been achieved.  

Perhaps I will elaborate further at some point but for now, let me present some apropos quotes.

(All emphasis mine.)

>I caught part of Assange's last episode and I must say I agree with one of the opinions shared. Child pornography is a symptom of a larger malaise in society, namely child abuse and exploitation. Simply putting so much emphasis on one medium of distribution (media delivered via the internet) suppresses and ignores what is going on all around us. Really, its a snap shot of a reality that is part of the fabric of society. **Destroying the evidence of it in one aspect does nothing to address it.** 

>It is simply an act of making unseen what is clearly a problem more widespread and larger than people looking at videos and pictures. Even if we were to imagine that we wiped out every single cache available online, it ignores that one of the most vulnerable segments of our population is still being exploited. The lopsided nature of policies targeting people that consume the media vs people who actually engage in abuse belies this.

>If people are abusing children and producing child porn, then go after them. [...]downloading such material does not harm a hair on a child's head. [...]Making possession, which on the net can even mean hidden thumbnails on web pages, is just plain Stupid. 

>To many idiots, enraged because they cant get the producers of child porn, attack anyone who might have seen it. Mind you this won't stop the producers or the consumers that pay for it. It has long ago been proven they have their own networks of distribution amongst themselves out side of the main stream.

>But these are hard to discover and interdict, but **as a law enforcement official or a politician you get the same boost in popularity if you go after the easier to catch people than the ones actually harming children**.
