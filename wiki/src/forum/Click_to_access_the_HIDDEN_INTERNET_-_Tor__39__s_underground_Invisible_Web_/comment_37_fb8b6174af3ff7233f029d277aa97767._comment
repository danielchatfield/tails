>Should Tails put links to arms dealers on the homepage?

The post is just pointing out that guns don't wander around the streets shooting people. People kill people. It can be a rock or a gun, both can be deadly

Putting a link to Hidden services on Tails is not putting a link to any one subject or item. 

for example, Is it bad that TOR has a link on its website to TAILS? Should we remove it? 

<https://www.torproject.org/projects/projects.html.en>

The link to TAILS on TOR's page is a link to the internet where TAILS is found

The internet also has advertisements for guns

<http://www.budsgunshop.com/>

Does this mean TOR has a link to guns on its website because of TAILS?
