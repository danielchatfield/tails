>There are various treaties and conventions which safeguard the most vulnerable members of society and the most fundamental necessities of human rights

 It sound like you are commited to helping those who are vulnerable in society ect. That is great, just please stay on topic and tell us what this has to do with the safety of Hidden Services. 

I would like to point out that I have been using Hidden services for well over a year now and I haven't come across anything which is illegal. The only thing I have  found is some copyright breaches which apply to the United States, This is not relevant to me as I live in India. If this applies to you, don't download the copyright music or other material as applicable in your state or territory.
