Why even use tails?

If you think the authorities who police the internet
1. do a good job
2. have honest motives

please get uninvolved from tails. You don't need anonymitty, or any protecion, they'll do it for you?

there is a lot of crap on the .onions, but there is also plenty on clearnet.

Do you think our current social economic or political leaders are all exemplary human beings?

Do you think that CNN or any other TV news station does a good job reporting the news? Do you trust the same politicians and business leaders who run your life to run to police the internet for you in your favor?

that said, some common sense applies with .onions. Anyone can make anything.

There are some benefits to .onion, for entirely non-controversial sites, and I use it myself:

solves the \"static ip/DNS problem\". in clearnet it costs money and you need a special connection to get a static IP. Most likely you'll only be buying a static IP in conjunction with paid web services. Then there is DNS which unlike the rest of the internet, is rigid, structured, and authoriatarian. You have to pay for a hostname, or use free dns like dyndns which flags you as a second class netizen.

If you run a server on a personal network, you open your entire network up for attacks, and tracking down the physical location of your server becomes real easy for stalkers, criminals, and the like.

Or you could pay to host in a datacenter, but to actually host a whole machine is a lot of money. more likely you'll get an apache VirtualHost. for webspace, and an unprivledged shell with a lot of restrictions of what you can and cannot run.

After that, you need SSL Cert which you need to pay a handful of companies trusted by webbrowser manufactures to have their root certs included stock. Running a server on a data center costs money. more than a hobyist wants to spend.

On top of that, its relatively easy to fake SSL certs, its easy to intercept website traffic, and unless you

When you run an .onion, you automaticly get a static DNS which is not immediately tracable. you don't have to worry as much about man-in-the-middle, and with .onions you get end-to-end encryption built in. TOR also acts a built in firewall as only ports specified are allowed.

Its easy to set up on a LAMPS stack, and works on home networks with none of the cost or headaches of

If someone is posting an .onion like thats not the official tails team chances are its bogus.
