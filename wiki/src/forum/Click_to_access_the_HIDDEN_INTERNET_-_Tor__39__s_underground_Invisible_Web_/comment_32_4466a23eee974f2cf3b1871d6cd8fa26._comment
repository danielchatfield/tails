@Comment #21 (\"Some facts...\")

You make valid points.

I just hope you did not mean to equate *legality* with *morality*. The two *diverge* and even *oppose* each other at least as often as they converge and align. 

In the United States, physicians are prosecuted for providing the drugs necessary to alleviate their terminally-ill patients' excrutiating misery. (Marijuana, in some cases, sufficient morphine, in others, etc.)

This is just one example but it happens to be one particularly relevant with regard to Tor hidden services. One of the known uses of \".onion\" sites is the trade and distribution of illegal drugs...
