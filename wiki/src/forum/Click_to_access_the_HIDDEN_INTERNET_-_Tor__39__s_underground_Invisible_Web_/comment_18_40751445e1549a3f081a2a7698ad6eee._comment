>What does any of this curious gibberish you're spewing have to do with the fact that your spurious movement* to festoon the Tails homepage and Tails Browser's bookmarks with links to the largely unpleasant and potentially dangerous .onion network, has been met with a resounding \"that's stupid\"?
* carefully chosen

festoon, lol. sounds like something a pirate would do. spurious movement. lol. I wonder if TOR thinks of its grand invention that way. spurious is what a bear does in the woods after a big meal! 

>with links to the largely unpleasant and potentially dangerous .onion network

Lets be honest, the internet is largely unpleasant and potentially dangerous. Lets not single out .onion sites. If we are going to have a discussion, lets talk details, not ohhh its bad don't even talk about it. 

Anyone who is reading this and is curious about hidden services, I suggest reading up on it before listening to all the same people who were fearful about the telephone and when we watch the evil \"television\" our brains would mush and then explode. Its all just fear and paranoia. I'm here to tell you that hidden services or similar to it are here to stay . Despite what anyone says they couldn't ban it or stop it if they tried. It would mean cracking down on any home network which didn't broadcast each node. No government is stupid enough to do that. The same argument is going on about wikileaks at the moment. Is it good is it evil? should we lock up julian assange or give him a medal. blah blah. Wikileaks is the same as hidden services, here to stay. Lets make use of it, improve it to be safer for the next generation

Nobody here has given any legitimate reason not to promote this next gen technology to the world
