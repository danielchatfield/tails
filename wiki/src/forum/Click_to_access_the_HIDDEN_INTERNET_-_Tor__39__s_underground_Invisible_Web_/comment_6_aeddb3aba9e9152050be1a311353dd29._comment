you would expect some really interesting, mind blowing information. instead what you're given is mostly crap, pdfs which are likely trojaned (why they don't release in txt or html format is beyond me) to call back to its master and track/log you and/or worse functions, honeypot like sites with little to no activity other than mostly static selection of content which hardly changes if it all from month to month.

in one word: most of the .onion sites are bait/traps and crap.
