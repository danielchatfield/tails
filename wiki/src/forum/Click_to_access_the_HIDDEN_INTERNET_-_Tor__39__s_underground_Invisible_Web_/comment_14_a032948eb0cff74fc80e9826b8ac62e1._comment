>Please stop ranting. 

lol ranting ranting when will it stop. ie When will they cease and realise my ideas are immutable. or , mum the other kids won't play with me

>No one here has suggesting censoring anything

yea i agree little billy, lets make them play and we will put the others in the corner where nobody will see them

>Many observers have simply been kind enough take the time and trouble to explain to you, often rather eloquently, why your stupid suggestion to spam .onion shit all over the Tails site is, well, stupid

Yeah kind souls they must be. Who exactly and why? shit, where?(dont step on it, you might offend their metaphor and it smells bad on your shoe)

>Stop flogging a dead horse

I will most certainly keep that in mind.  Now I'm usually up with these references but help me out. this must be repeating your last conviction about the only reference you have given ie .onion sites rite? I like this metaphor better, it doesn't smell, but i feel sorry for the horse

>Your stupid suggestion is STUPID.

Thats great. Now unfortunately i'm going to have to give you a C- for your little essay. You have stated your argument (in a long winded sort of way) but you see little jhonny, you just haven't provided any supporting evidence. I suggest you revisit this assignment and I will have a chat to mommy and daddy see if we can get you playing a little less nintendo and a little more study


>You clearly have nothing to say, could you kindly find a way to say it more succinctly?

Now now jhonny, nobody likes a spoil sport. We know you have trouble saying what it is that you mean but it's getting a bit tiring. I'm not even going to ask what needs succincting, and get you home for a sleep
