I find it Hilarious that so many people  are so passionately against anonymous internet publishing on a website dedicated to TOR. . Any argument against hidden services is an argument against TOR and against anonymity.

The last comment made  with all its wit and wisdom then finishing with   comment by anonymous 

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL

Bah-ha-ha people are so amusing, its entertaining 

 I am waiting for them all to include their IP address and phone number so we can tell them how we really feel about their brilliance 

\"Harder\" than what? Tracing you from a hidden site is, if anything, theoretically slightly more plausible from a .onion server than from any ordinary webserver visited via Tor/Tails.\"

very interesting information anonymous, I would very much like to see the source of that info, or is it anonymous too?

LOLOLOLOL oh stop your hurting me now
