Please stop ranting. No one here has suggesting censoring anything. No one has sought to deprive you of your newly discovered CP channel. Many observers have simply been kind enough take the time and trouble to explain to you, often rather eloquently, why your stupid suggestion to spam .onion shit all over the Tails site is, well, stupid.

Stop flogging a dead horse.

Your stupid suggestion is **STUPID**.

You clearly have *nothing* to say, could you kindly find a way to say it more succinctly?
