>It sound like you are commited to helping those who are vulnerable in society ect. That is great, just please stay on topic and tell us what this has to do with the safety of Hidden Services.

This thread isn't about \"the safety of Hidden Services\" it's a request for Tails to advertise them. That exchange seems perfectly appropriate to me. Perhaps you need to see it in context:

>>>The content on the .onion network is largely illegal. [...]unfit for promotion by the Tails project.

>>What law are you referring to?

>There are various treaties and conventions which safeguard the most vulnerable members of society and the most fundamental necessities of human rights. Do your own research.

>I would like to point out that I have been using Hidden services for well over a year now and I haven't come across anything which is illegal. The only thing I have found is some copyright breaches which apply to the United States,

Why would your professed browsing expertise (or lack thereof) be of interest to anyone? This thread is about a request for Tails to advertise \"hidden sites\" on \"the darknet\". *please stay on topic*

>This is not relevant to me as I live in India. If this applies to you, don't download the copyright music or other material as applicable in your state or territory.

Strange. Your poor literacy, narcissism, amorality, etc. all point at you being American. I would have expected better from an Indian. However, this thread isn't about you. *please stay on topic*
