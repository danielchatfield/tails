> I believe it is not one of Tails' goals to provide anti-stylometry.

Did you read the design?

> The Privacy Enhancing Live Distribution (or PELD for short) aims at providing a software solution providing the user with the technological means for using popular Internet technologies while maintaining the privacy of the user, in particular with respect to anonymity. 

Stylometry does fight against this goal. So why shouldn't it be a goal?

> If users are afraid of being traced by their writing styles, they should just change/modify them when using Tails.

They can't. 1. No one tells them beside in some deeply buried forum topic and 2. it's too difficult and error prone.

> What is so difficult in doing it?

Because people who did it could still get traced. Stylometry is so powerful and will be even more powerful in future.

The video talk about it specifically goes into that.

> short-term solution or example for anti-Stylometry is to write your comment then process it through google translate e.g. english to german to sweden back to english... then minor tweak to make the comment understandable. useful ? 

It's barely readable and google has a copy of all versions. Why assume big brother does not already get a copy of all originals and translated versions?
