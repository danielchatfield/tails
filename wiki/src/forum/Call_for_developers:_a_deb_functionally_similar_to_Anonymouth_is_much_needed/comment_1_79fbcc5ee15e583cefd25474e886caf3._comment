>I echo that plea.

I re-echo the plea that you quoted:

>Please, someone, help fix the free anti-stylometry software situation on GNU/Linux, and then I'm happy discussing how it could be included in Tails.

I believe it is not one of Tails' goals to provide anti-stylometry. If users are afraid of being traced by their writing styles, they should just change/modify them when using Tails. What is so difficult in doing it?
