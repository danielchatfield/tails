Cool. This is what I understood initially, and why I simply and shortly
explained why I would *not* spend time working on this. I did not suggest you
*demanded* it or something, and I'm glad you were not.

I accept your apologies.

> Second, were you speaking for all of your fellow Tails devs?

I was speaking for myself: \"my personal commitment\" is *mine*. I'll say \"we\" and
\"our\" when I mean it :)

Yeah, perhaps a half of Tails users would marginally benefit from disabling
CUPS, that's needed by others. Another half may marginally benefit from removing
this or that software, that's needed by others, etc. This is all fine and great,
and users are obviously free to customize their Tails to their liking... as long
as they don't expect any support from us whatsoever: we're happy to provide
support for Tails, but *not* for the result of combining every possibly
meaningful customization of Tails. Fair enough?

To end with, I'm happy to *consider* and *discuss* all this once I'm shown that
CUPS is dangerous enough, in Tails threat model, to be worth that many words
and work. Sorry for perhaps not being proactive enough on this topic, and sorry not to be thrilled about every possible discussion about Tails,
see [[todo]] and [[contribute/roadmap]] to get an idea why ;)
