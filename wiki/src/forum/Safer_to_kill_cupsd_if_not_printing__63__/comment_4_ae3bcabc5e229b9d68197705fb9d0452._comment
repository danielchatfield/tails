>Printing is explictly listed in Tails design goals on design. 

OP here, I never meant to suggest otherwise. I think you may have misunderstood me.

I was not suggesting, in any way, that Tails remove cupsd. I was simply asking, rather, whether, in a case where someone will *not* need to print, it is safe or advisable to kill cupsd.
