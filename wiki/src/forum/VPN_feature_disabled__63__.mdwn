Hi

I am trying to connect to VPN but 'add' button is disabled in network connections. Is there an alternate way to use VPN with tails?

Correct me if I am wrong, I think using VPN along with Tor would add an additional layer of anonimity which is better, so why is this disabled?

One other question please..

How is I2P used with Tails? does it start automatically with browser?
