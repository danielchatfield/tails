> If I use a version 0.9 or 0.10 ISO downloaded from your site under VirtualBox (as virtual CD), I get an \"Unable to read boot device\" error.

Please post your Tails VirtualBox configuration.

> Some of the sectors in the ISO file seem to be unreadable.

I don't think so since you claim:

> The signatures of the downloaded files were checked, and everything was correct

From this it would follow that the integrity of the ISO images are good.

> The same happens when I burn these files to a physical CD-ROM, but in these cases the boot process continues until it shows an X login prompt! The strange thing is that these same ISO files used from a USB stick work perfectly ok.

That's indeed strange. Normally this would imply a difference in the kernel command line arguments passed from syslinux/isolinux. Check if they are the same.
