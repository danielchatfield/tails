I have both TAILS 0.13 and 0.14~rc1 burned to two separate USB flash drives.

My computer BIOS is set to boot from USB before CD/DVD and then hard drive, however, I need to use the PLoP Boot Manager, plpbt.iso burned to CD to transfer control to the USB because my CPU is an Intel P4 circa 2005.  Newer firmware/Motherboards and CPU may have more complete BIOS settings that do not require the PLop Boot Manager to assist USB booting.

Both TAILS version only have two folders at the highest level of the ISO filesystem, which are \"live\" with 5 items and \"syslinux\" with 22 items.

Check your BIOS boot order, and get plpbt.iso from pendrivelinux.com and burn it to a Live CD to use it with the 0.13/0.14 TAILS USB plugged in when you boot, if you need it.
