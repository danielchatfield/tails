>Any Japanese users out there? 

I don't think there will be many Japanese users of Tails. The reasons are as follows:

1. Japan is a fully democractic country unlike China which is controlled by a one-party communist regime.
2. There are no censorship laws curtailing freedom on the net in Japan unlike those in China.

As a side note, on behalf of North Koreans, I request that the next version of Tails include Korean input support such as SCIM-Hangul.
