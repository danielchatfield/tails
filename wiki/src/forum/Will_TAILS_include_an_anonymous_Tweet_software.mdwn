I see that both the Register and Darknet web sites have posts up about a piece of software called Vibe (by Zami.com) for anonymous tweeting.

One problem is it is an iOS App, so it may not last long if Apple pulls it.

Is TAILS thinking about or planning to do anything regarding this capability (an anonymous tweeting social media app) for TAILS in future releases?
