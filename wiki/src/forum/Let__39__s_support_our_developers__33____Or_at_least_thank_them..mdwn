I just want to reiterate my thanks to the hardworking Tails and Tor developers for providing these tools.  Maintaining and improving them is, as I dimly appreciate, a never-ending and all too often thankless task.

In this line of work, I suspect that all too often the surest indication that you are providing a needed product is that many people insistently demand bugfixes, improvements, clarifications, documentations, and expanded services.

Clearly, there are not enough privacy-minded developers to address all the pressing needs which exist in our troubled world.  I just want to say thanks for doing what you do, and to acknowledge that this has to be enough for those of us who lack the essential skills to try to use for good whatever software tools are available "as is", so that we can perhaps contribute somehow to addressing the many ills of our troubled world.

It is not easy, when we have so many fearsome, merciless and determined enemies, but we owe it to the fallen to keep trying.
