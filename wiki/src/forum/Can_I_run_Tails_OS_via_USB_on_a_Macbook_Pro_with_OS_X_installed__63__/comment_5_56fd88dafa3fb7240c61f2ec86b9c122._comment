Tails does not run on Mac PowerPC because it is a different architecture.

There has been some attempts to make a PowerPC version as you can see on [[our todo item on that issue|todo/powerpc_support]]. But this is far from being a priority and might indeed never been officially released since that would imply having to support two official images instead of one.
