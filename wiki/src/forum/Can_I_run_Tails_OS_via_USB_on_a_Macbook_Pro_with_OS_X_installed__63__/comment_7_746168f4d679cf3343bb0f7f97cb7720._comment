> This boot is useless as far as traveling goes if there won't be any PCs encountered.

What kind of travel would that be, a travel between campus dormitories, or between liberal arts colleges? In most of the world one rarely sees fashion items like Macs used for real work (except design and music perhaps). In any way, not being able to boot from USB on arbitrary computers seems like an inherent limitation of Macs. If rEFIt works, then that's the solution.
