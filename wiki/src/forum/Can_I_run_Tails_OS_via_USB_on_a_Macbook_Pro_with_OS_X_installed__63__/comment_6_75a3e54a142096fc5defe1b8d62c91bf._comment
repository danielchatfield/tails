rEFit allows one to boot the USB stick on the mac with rEFit installed, but how does one create a USB stick that can be booted on ANY Mac (or at least any Intel Mac?)

19/20 computers I encounter are Macs, and I can only think of one PC owner. This boot is useless as far as traveling goes if there won't be any PCs encountered. 

What can be done to make a USB stick that will mount on anything?
