Ok, using the below method will only work with 64 bit linux ISO's
http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/57964/booting-ubuntu-from-usb-on-a-mac 
Tails is still 32 bit ISO and this method won't work with Intel macs, but might work with G4's and G5's. I think tails is possibly going 64 bit so this method will probably work then... but CD booting still works fine for Intel Mac's in the meanwhile.
