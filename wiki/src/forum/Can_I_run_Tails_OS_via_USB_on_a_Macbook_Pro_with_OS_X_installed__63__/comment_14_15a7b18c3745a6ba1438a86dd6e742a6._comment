Hey guys, let me start off by saying, I have no clue how this worked, but it worked for me. I'm running a late 2012 Macbook pro.  This method uses TWO flash drives but ends with ONE. I'll first go through all the random ways it didn't work for me.  

What did NOT work.

1. Installing to a usb from a bootable live disc 

2. Using Lili Installer

3. Using \"Universal Usb Installer\" from pendrivelinuxDOTcom

4. Partitioning the usb drive with Refit at the root, and installing Tails via Unetbootin on the remaining partition did not work. Refit would load at the boot screen, and my tails partition would show up. But when launched it would load my Windows bootcamp partition.  Something very strange going' on there. Even though this didn't work, it ended up working in the end, with a little help. 

Ok, so thats what did not work, lets start with what worked and maybe you genius's out there can figure out the how.  

1. I was about to give up when I decided I would go the lame way and use two Usb's, so I grabbed an old 2GB attache' drive I had laying around and used Unetbootin to install tails Linux.  (Also, is there an easier way to discover what your disk lable is? Ex: disk0s3,0s1,0s2,ect? I ended up using the log from Disk Utility) Now I just pretty much did this stock.  Reformat to Fat. Run Unetbootin. Bingo Tails on a USB. 

2.Now we all know this doesn't work, but with rEfit on my other drive you now have a window into the boot screen, where your 2nd Usb drive is waiting to be loaded. 

3. Now heres where the electronic gods started messing with me. Unetbootin loads to a boot screen where your offered options. The first option was labeled \"default\" so I gave that one a go. Now this lead to a long stream of text that eventually froze. I restarted, held \"option\" as we do... this time something strange popped up in the boot options, Refit was still there, but there was a new option labled \"windows\" with the beautiful USB icon.  (i wanted to load it but i didn't, not yet)  I decided to go the refit route, and this time I choose \"live\" at the boot screen instead of \"default\".  As expected it worked. But what was that weird windows drive I saw pop up? 

I pulled the refit drive and decided to boot with the tails only drive.  And again I see it. The new \"windows\" option. I selected it. and VOILA. Tails, running on One usb. By the will of the Gods i have no clue what process, or random step I did that made this possible. I don't know if its my ghetto 8 year old flash drive. There were many variables, but its working. Ive tried to document my steps as best as possible and hope this random mess of a way works for someone.
