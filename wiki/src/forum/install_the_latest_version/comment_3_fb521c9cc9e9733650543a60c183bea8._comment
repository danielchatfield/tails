> So it is not possible to have a seperate parition on the usb drive you have tails installed on if you installed by the so called \"standard way\"? I was thinking about creating a parition on my usb drive for media storage so I wouldn't have to have two usb drives plugged in.

It is possible, but not when you have installed it the \"standard way\" (since that will create a funny partition table etc.). If you want to have Tails and an encrypted partition on the same USB drive, please [[see this guide|forum/How_do_I_do_what_unetbootin_does/#comment-fc6a0040a29918839343a50396ef4082]].

> The sandisk cruzer has 8gb of free space and a 601mb tails parition according to disk utitly. Is the 601mb tails parition the same as the 589mb file system. The numbers don't add up.

Probably due to mismatch in how they count bytes, e.g. is one kilobyte 1000 bytes or 1024 bytes.

> My usb drive's capacity is 8gb. If tails is on there and the 589mb file system there shouldn't be 8gb of free space.

There's 8 GB - 589 MB of *unused* space. Sure, it's free too, but it's inaccessible if you installed Tails the \"standard way\" (see earlier answer).
