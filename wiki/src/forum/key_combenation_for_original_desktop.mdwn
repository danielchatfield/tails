Hi,

I don't know if there is such a function, but I think a key combination for switching to the original system would be great.

For example, if a persons know your computer he is able to notice the difference in the desktop or the system.

An example: You use tails and a familymember entering the room asking for a special document. If there would be a key combination to switch between the systems you could go to the "normal" system without anyone noticing.

That is the good thing with tor. If anyone comes in, you can minimize it an knowone notice.
