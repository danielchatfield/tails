hello

i was trying to edit the live.cfg file on a running tails (on a stick)

tried to use this :

mount -o remount,rw /live/image

this gave me a /live/image with rw permissions :

root@amnesia:~# mount -o remount,rw /live/image

root@amnesia:~# ls -l /live/image

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 18 Apr  7 12:22 /live/image -> /live/mount/medium

root@amnesia:~# 

but trying to edit the /live/image/isolinux/live.cfg was definately not permited... because file system was ro !!!
(used vi as root tried to override with wq! no success)

as a matter of fact the link /live/image points to /live/mount/medium wich remains ro :

root@amnesia:~# ls -l /live/mount/medium/

total 6
dr-xr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr  7 12:43 isolinux

dr-xr-xr-x 2 root root 2048 Apr  7 12:43 live

root@amnesia:~#


so here i am stuck if somebody will help me i would appreciate

thanks.
