    Oops, looks like a bug.

Thank you, glad to be of service.

    What is amnesia branding?
    
    It's an extension that sets some settings (e.g. homepage) depending on the chosen locale.

Is there a page which lists everything this branding provides, please?

    Why is it auto updating?
    Looks like a bug. Going to file it.

Thank you.

    Can it safely be removed?
        
    This might be true right now, but I would not rely on this remaining to be the case.

Thank you.
