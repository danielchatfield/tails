hi, I have been using tails for a year or so now, and when I downloaded it before it was by direct download. I tried downloading it by torrent but I always got bad signature.
Today I realized it was due to a silly mistaque on my part.I was verifying the tails iso I downloaded by torrent with the torrent signature because I thougth it related to the iso downloaded by torrent.
I realize how sily this is, but perhaps modyfying the Tails 0.13 torrent signature button to Tails 0.13 torrent FILE signature would help other users with verifying by gpg.thanks
