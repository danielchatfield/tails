UPDATE

OP here, I'm about to test the following by adding a rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/zz.rules:

ACTION=="remove", SUBSYSTEM=="block", KERNEL=="sd*", RUN+="sudo -n halt"

/UPDATE/

I like the way removing the Tails OS automatically shuts down the system. Could a program be made using the same action for any usb device that's plugged in?

I'm assuming it's possible to clone a running operating system, or at least what's in ram, from an external USB device (would it have to be mounted?)

xscreensaver is decent to prevent most attackers, but if someone has the ability to clone your system while it's running it doesn't do much good. So I figure if every usb/firewire port was used, and upon the removal of ANY of these devices a shutdown was triggered, attackers would be unable to clone the system.

I was looking at udevadm to detect a trigger and Tails has it installed, I just can't find out how.
