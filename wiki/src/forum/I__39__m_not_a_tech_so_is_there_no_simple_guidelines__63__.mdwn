I'm not real smart in the internet and ain't too old either but kind of concerned about this stuff. This will probably be my last post since I don't really belong it seems but can I leave knowing any guidelines? What can someone like me do to use tails? Like how can someone like me feel ok to simply browse websites and do normal stuff with privacy for privacy's sake? My thought was just to simply connect to a public wifi somewhere using tails/tor or something and maybe for email do the same. Is that not good? Is the internet a scary thing? Why use it then?

I just want to know the backbone or simple stuff I can live by like is there any room tails/tor provides or anything recommended easy enough for someone like me to follow and do??? I don't know.
