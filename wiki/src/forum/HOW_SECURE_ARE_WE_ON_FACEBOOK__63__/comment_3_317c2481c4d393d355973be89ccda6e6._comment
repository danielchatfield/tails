Depends on what you're afraid of.

Afraid of having your information sold to marketers or strangers for $5? Not secure.

Afraid of having your information subpeona'd(no warrant/judge needed) by police? Not secure.

Afraid of having your image scanned by facebook-wide facial recognition software(excluding europe)? Not secure.

Afraid of Facebook knowing where you've been because of +1/Like buttons on websites(if you're logged in)? Not secure.
