Very unlikely that torrent downloaded incorrectly.
It is split into 3047 pieces that each have their own weak hash check and then the entire torrent has a strong hash check.

The download page has the hash...
<https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#download.verify-the-iso-image-using-other-operating-systems>

If you still cannot find it... 639f0448ed2e05200095e49e86d730b383238ae1ed352e6bad97b9d212a0ff6b
