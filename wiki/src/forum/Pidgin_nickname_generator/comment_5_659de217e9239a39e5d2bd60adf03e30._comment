BTW, I was not able to fix the link on the design page (page locked):

config/chroot local-includes/lib/live/config/201-pidgin

should be instead

config/chroot local-includes/lib/live/config/201**0**-pidgin

Is this typo-mistake responsible for this (now old and perhaps solved) bug?  
<https://tails.boum.org/bugs/non-random_nick_in_Pidgin/>  
I've been briefly search in the gitweb, but was not able to locate user's `/var/lib/live/config`, and so not able to verify if this hook was correctly called..

Cheers,  
Tom
