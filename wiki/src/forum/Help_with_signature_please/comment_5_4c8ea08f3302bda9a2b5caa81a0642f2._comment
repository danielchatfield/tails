For some reason PGP is a pain in the butt to learn ;)

I only use it for remote login but encryption of documents, storing passwords, certificate validation (key chains) - bung a key on a USB stick, put that in a safe (make sure you cover the keypad with a cloth when you open the safe - enter the PIN using touch), and put the safe in a room where you can lock/bolt etc. the door behind you (you know the windows are secure etc.).  And that is about as secure as it gets!  (Other useful measures, a home CCTV ((or even just a camera in your 'secure study')), an alarm that locks inner doors until outer doors are closed, etc.)
