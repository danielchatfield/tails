Tails in a VM has some risks that running Tails on bare metal doesn't, but it also provides some protections.  Basically, using a VM increases your protection if your attacker is coming over the network, but reduces it if your attacker has physical access to the computer.

The main risk is that if the host machine is running a hostile program, that program can see what's going on inside the VM; another risk is that if the host OS uses virtual memory, bits of Tails' memory can end up on the hard disk.

On the other hand, a hostile program running in the Tails VM would need to break not only Tails' security but also the VM's sandbox to get direct access to the machine.
