This is the case scenario:

I use tails on a USB drive without persistence on my notebook that has no hard drive. I don't use any other flash drives.

I have stored a .zip file within only plain text files on an online server. Each time that I start Tails and need my precious but dangerous plain textfiles, I download them, save them on the desktop and extract them to the desktop. I often edit these files, compress them again and upload them back to the server. After that I wipe all the files on my desktop. Does this wiping really work or not? Or is it better to use a notebook with hard drive, temporarily save the files on hard drive and then wipe the files (that is according the Tails docs SECURE because the files is being wiped from a HARD drive)?


And what about this case: when I temporarily copy text from an online source and I paste that into a plain textfile on my desktop (running Tails usb without hard drive). What exactly happens when 'pasting' text into the file. I edit the text in that file and cut the text again and paste it back into the file on the online server. Of course I close the file and don't save it after.

Now is it in any way still possible for investigators to retrieve the text that was pasted into the unsaved file when examinating the usb drive? 

And what about cutting a file (txt, .doc, .zip etc.) itself from my hard or usb drive and pasting it on the drive of a public computer? Will the file really completely be moved from my own drive or will dirty little pieces of that file still be recoverable for professional investigators?

And yes, I'm very paranoid!
