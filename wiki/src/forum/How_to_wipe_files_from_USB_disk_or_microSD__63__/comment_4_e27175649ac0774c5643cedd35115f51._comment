Then fret ye not, Tails is a *live* OS... So all the user files (Desktop as well as the rest of the user filesystem) exist only in RAM. That's why it all disappears when you restart Tails - it's not that your disks are being wiped between sessions, it's that the data is never being written to any disks. Only if you enable persistence or manually mount a filesystem and then save to that does *anything* get written to permanent media.

My biggest concern would be the .zip file. Are you encrypting filenames? Does that matter? Does a .zip offer a sufficiently robust security margin? I'd be inclined to replace the .zip with a Truecrypt container... protected by at least one keyfile as well as a passphrase... not least because the desperate FUD campaign against Truecrypt is good evidence in its self of how good it is ;-)

If you're as paranoid as you claim to be, you could always keep your current .zip file in the container, thus \"layering\" your encryption. Being sure to use different passwords - naturally.
