> And after shutting down and automatically wiping the RAM, a saved file on the desktop will also be wiped fully from the RAM? (I don't know, but maybe the RAM wiping wipes only system configurations and logs etc. but not saved files on the desktop during Tails session).

Tails is designed so any files that you do not explicitly write to a persistent storage will only be written in RAM.

On shutdown, the whole memory is wiped with no distinctions about its content.
