Thank you for your comment! The most important thing for me was to know 100% sure that when I'm saving a downloaded file on Tails' desktop, that the file will not be saved on the usb drive where the unpersistent Tails is running. but only temporarily in the RAM. And when deleting/wiping the saved file before shutting down, in that case it will neither be deleted/wiped to the usb drive where Tails is running. Is it like this, that when running unpersistent Tails on a usb drive, files can NEVER get to the storage of that usb drive? So also never have to worry that textfiles used during a Tails session will be recovevable/retrievable in any way from the Tails usb drive. 

And after shutting down and automatically wiping the RAM, a saved file on the desktop will also be wiped fully from the RAM? (I don't know, but maybe the RAM wiping wipes only system configurations and logs etc. but not saved files on the desktop during Tails session).

Can a Tails dev also please confirm this?

Thank you!
