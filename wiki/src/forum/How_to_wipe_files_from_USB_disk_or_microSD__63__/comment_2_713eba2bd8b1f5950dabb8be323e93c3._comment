>So it's safer to save files temporarily on a hard disk and then wipe it instead of working with usb or microSD?

Ramdisk and/or encrypted with a strong *session* password would be my choices... Perhaps in an encrypted archive or a Truecrypt container depending on your <strike>degree of paranoia</strike> perceived threat ;-)

Something like..

    cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc [:alnum:] | head -c64; echo

...aught to do you for the session pw. Easily embedded in a script too - in case you'd like to automate the setup of your scratch space.
