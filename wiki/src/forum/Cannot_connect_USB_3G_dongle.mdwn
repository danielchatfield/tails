I cannot connect my 3g dongle with tails 0.11.
I configure the mobile broadband from the network connection tab and choose appropriate parameters for setting up my 3g usb dongle. But it won't work.

I am using a Huawei UUZ300 3G Datacard.

Plz help me cause it is my only internet connection.

Can anyone help?
