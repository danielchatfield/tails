You seem to have been *indulging* in the *rambling speculation* of *presuming* that any number of various posts \"all over this forum\" were all authored by:
a) the same person ,
and,
b) the same person who authored the post in this thread that you were replying-to

That's quite a bit of *indulging*, *speculation* and *presuming*...
