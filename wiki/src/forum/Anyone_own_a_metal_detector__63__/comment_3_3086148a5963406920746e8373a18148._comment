Why do you want to hide the media?

If you are afraid of someone figuring out what you got on it you should use full disk encryption on it. Alternatively if you need plausible denialability you should combine encryption with steganography.

If you are afraid of losing the data in a raid or similar, upload an encrypted backup to some filehosting service somewhere. Anonymously of course so no one watching you connection sees that you done so.

I wouldn't count on hiding, it sound like a bit weak way to protect something against whatever you are trying to protect it against. I mean, if you are suspected you are probably doomed anyway, so better not attract the attention.
