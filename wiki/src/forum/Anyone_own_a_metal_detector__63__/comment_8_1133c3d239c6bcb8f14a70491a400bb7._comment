Comment 3/6,

You seem to be presuming *all* of the following. 

That OP:

* Doesn't need the data to survive for more than a few months. Or a few years at the very outside.
* Doesn't require a high margin of security.
* Has an excellent memory.
* Will *always* have an excellent memory.
* Has an internet connection.
* Can connect the secure system to the internet.
* Wishes to connect the secure system to the internet.
* Is willing and able to regularly babysit multiple online repositories of the sensitive data.
* Will remain willing and able to regularly babysit multiple online repositories of the sensitive data for as long as that data is needed to survive.
* Will be able to regularly babysit multiple online repositories in perpetuity without \"attracting suspicion\".
* Is able to divine whether he/she is under suspicion \*
* Can drop every requirement for privacy/security upon falling under suspicion.


And that Tor & Tails become useless the moment you \"attract attention\" and actually *need* them.

That is obviously deranged.

You've also conspicuously failed to answer OP's (single) question.

You seem to have been indulging in this sort of rambling speculation all over this forum... which you follow with relentless puerile bickering with whoever points out the utter irrelevance of your initial post or asks you to stop. It *doesn't matter* if Jap was renamed Jondonym. That sort of crappy pedantry makes *you* look small and stupid, not the other person. It contributes nothing of *any* value to the thread, to the OP or to this forum. If your design permits, could you disengage the inanity chip for a bit and give us all a break?

\* perhaps you intend to impart your special powers of answer divination to OP for this one.
