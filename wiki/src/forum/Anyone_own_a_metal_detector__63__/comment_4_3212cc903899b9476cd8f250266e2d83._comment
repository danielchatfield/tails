>Why do you want to hide the media?

RE: OP: To prevent it being discovered I'd imagine. I'm very interested to see (actually pertinent) answers to this too.

RE: Comment 1: God knows. The mind boggles!

The remainder of this comment pertains to OP, as, I hope, will at least some of the other comments to this thread! :-|

>If you are afraid of someone figuring out what you got on it you should use full disk encryption on it.

And where would you keep your backup keyfiles/headers etc?

>Alternatively if you need plausible denialability you should combine encryption with steganography.

Do you know of a probably effective steganography application? Is it more reliable and robust than off-the-premises backup?

>If you are afraid of losing the data in a raid or similar, upload an encrypted backup to some filehosting service somewhere.

Where do you safely and securely store the relevant url, account credentials, etc? What happens when the chosen website disappears?

>Anonymously of course so no one watching you connection sees that you done so.

How do you *guarantee* online anonymity? Tor? Jap? Freenet? Freenet over Jap over Tor? Has any of these methods ever been *proven* effective?

>I wouldn't count on hiding, it sound like a bit weak way to protect something against whatever you are trying to protect it against.

You don't know what the problem is yet you know the solution? I wish I could do that!

>I mean, if you are suspected you are probably doomed anyway, so better not attract the attention.

That's the spirit. We should all roll over and succumb to totalitarianism. Resistance is futile.
