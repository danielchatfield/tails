Thanks! I can't wait until I walk with a Micro SD in my rectum through an airport metal detector. It's a thrilling expectation. I will follow all your recommendations thoroughly. Please supply all necessary details as to the proper way to insert the memory device into one's rectum, so that it cannot be detected.
