Correct me if I'm wrong but I was under the impression that Tor Browser Bundle provides sufficient privacy and anonymity when one is surfing the web.

One doesn't have to worry about iptables firewall when using Tor Browser Bundle, no?

By the way, what's the equivalent of iptables in Windows OS? I'm a newbie to Linux distros.
