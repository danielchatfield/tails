Sounds like half the battle... you've paid a great deal of attention to what is *removed*... applications installed, eliminating persistence, etc...

You don't seem to have put much thought into the other side of the coin... the great deal of work that's *added* to Tails. Myriad carefully considered scripts, applications, configuration adjustments, etc... It's *that* work that makes a secure distro secure more than what's omitted. How do your iptables firewall rules compare to those of Tails for example?
