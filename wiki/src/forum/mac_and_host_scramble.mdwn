Hi, Ninja OS dev team here. this is the script I've written for scrambling the host name and all ethernet macs

mh_scramble.sh

NOTE: it needs macchanger and apg (both binaries, both available in debian repos).

apg is the automatic password generator. It can make pronounceable passwords. Of course this is used to make pronounceable host names, so the LOOK LESS random.

I use the macchanger binary because it seems to be more stable than just ifconfig hwaddress

it works great for ninja OS, I hope you can make use of it in someway!
