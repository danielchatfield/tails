I reported 3 separate bugs through Whisperback. 1) Failure to shut down; 2) lost connections requiring a reboot and 3) the Startpage problem and potential workaround.

Do they need approval before being put on the list or is there first a determination on if they are bugs or system problems first, and therefore not bugs?

I'm wondering if they made it through to Tails devs.
