`eepget` is the easiest to use, but it's quite barebones compared to `wget`. If you really need `wget`, reconfigure the `http_proxy` variable in its global configuration file, `/etc/wgetrc` (which takes precedence over any proxy configurations in the shell environment). Copy it to `$HOME/.wgetrc` and alter it there to avoid the need administrative privileges.
