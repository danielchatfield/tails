Hi there. There was a problem booting "Tails - Privacy for everyone" https://tails.boum.org/ . Last time i downloaded a version 1.5,it didn`t run . i thought the version 1.7.1  might run now and bugs,errors would be fixed. But it doesn`t work on my laptop. I send you some photos of the failure of the programm. Maybe you have already met with the difficulties .Thank you.
