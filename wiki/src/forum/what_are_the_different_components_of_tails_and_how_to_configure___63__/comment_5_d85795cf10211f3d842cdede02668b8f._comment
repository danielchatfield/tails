I'm successful to tor-enforcement at browsing level i.e. http/s following the documentation as
described at

 https://cryptoanarchy.org/wiki/Build_your_own_livething
and 
http://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Configs/Tor

But the other protocol say ssh is still not torified, I have already set the firewall accordingly. Obviously I can use torsocs command but I am working to have it at the system level. How can I debug ? Anything missing ? I have followed the docs as mentioned above.

the services running are

tor
pdnsd
ttdnsd
privoxy
iptables
