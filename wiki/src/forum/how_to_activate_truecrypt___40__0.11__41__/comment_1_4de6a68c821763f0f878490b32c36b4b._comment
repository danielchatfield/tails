looking at the documentation, I would assume that it's a bit dated and that it refers to the syslinux boot prompt of older versions where there was a language choice before Tails was loaded. Now the language and keyboard options happen after X has loaded with the new tails greeter (...with persistence and root options too). Pressing tab and entering \"truecrypt\" won't do anything - it's too late, the oportunity is missed.

Instead, when you boot Tails and see the debian live image (where the language options used to be) press tab and then add the truecrypt boot parameter as per the instructions in the documentation. If truecrypt is still included as before, this should work.

If not, then there is an open source alternative to truecrypt which works with truecrypt containers that you should look up (sorry I don't know the name)... You can probably find it in the synaptic package manager.
