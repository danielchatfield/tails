My quick and dirty, guideline.

Requirements:
1.	Working Tails 0.11, installed on a pendrive, a.k.a. usb stick,
2.	Ubuntu Live cd, version 12.04, http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

*** CAUTION *** Proceed at own risk. Unsupported feature. May compromise Tails security policy.

1.	Boot your pc with Ubuntu Live cd, boot in “try this” mode.
2.	Insert the Tails pendrive in the usb port.
3.	On the Ubuntu desktop, click “home folder” icon (second from the top). You should see a “Tails” device in “/media/tails”.
4.	Navigate to “syslinux” folder.
5.	Locate the file “live.cfg”. Rightclick on “live.cfg” file, choose “open with text editor”. Gedit text editor should open the cfg file.
6.	Locate the “label live” paragraph.
7.	Locate the “append” line in that paragraph. Example “append initrd=/live/initrd.img boot=live config noswap  ….”.
8.	Add “  truecrypt” at the end of that line . Note the 2 spaces before the world “truecrypt”
9.	Click “save”, Close Gedit text editor
10.	Rightclick on “Tails” in your Ubuntu “home folder” media tab, “safely remove device”
11.	Shutdown Ubuntu.
