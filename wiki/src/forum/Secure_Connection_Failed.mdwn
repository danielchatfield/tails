A few sites have been giving me a Secure Connection Failed popup. I can browse the sites, but the error message is unnerving. Should I be worried?

e.g.

Visiting bbc.co.uk/news gives me the following popup:


Secure Connection Failed


sa.bbc.com:443 uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is only valid for *.112.2o7.net

(Error code: ssl_error_bad_cert_domain)


This could be a problem with the server's configuration or it could be someone trying to impersonate the server.

If you have connected to this server succesfully in the past the error may be temporary and you can try again later.



Should I be worried?
