We've had several complaints of this type recently and the thing all users seem to have in common is that they used Universal USB Installer 1.8.7.8, as our instructions suggest. It could be that this newly released version screwed something up. Has any one succeeded installing Tails using Universal USB Installer 1.8.7.8? Can some one try to revert back to the previous version (to find it just google for: Universal USB Installer 1.8.7.7)?
