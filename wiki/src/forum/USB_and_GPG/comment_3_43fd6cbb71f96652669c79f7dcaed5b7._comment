I have enabled \"persistence\" on my USB I just need to know when I create a New Key pair through the terminal with 

-gpg --gen-key

If that key is saved once I turn the computer off? 

Or would I have to manually save it to a new folder I would have to create in my new \"persistent\" folder under /home/Persistent
