With an attitude like that, I wonder why you post here.

Neither of us know anything about the poster who asked for source code, who may not be lazy but may simply not know how to obtain the source code for a Debian package.  Why not let those willing to give newbies the benefit of the doubt, reply, instead of jumping to conclusions and making fun of a new Tails user?
