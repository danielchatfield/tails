>@ Comment 5:

>What is your problem?

Comment 5 makes a perfectly good point, although perhaps rather curtly. The author of comment 2 is *already* provided with all the source. If he/she is too incompetent/lazy to make use of it, then going out of one's way to \"provide it\" is hardly going to be anything other than a waste of time. Is it?
