@ Comment 5:

What is your *problem*?

@ \"Tails\":

I think I just figured out what the OP was trying to ask.  I think he/she was trying to ask about modifying the \"unsafe\" browser in Tails to resemble the TBB-provided browser.   If so, it might be worthwhile to ask for clarification instead of simply shutting the thread down.

@ OP:

If I guessed right, surely a better way of comparing the two would be to install TBB from a verified tarball?  Or is the problem that you are borrowing a computer you don't own, but which you boot from a DVD?
