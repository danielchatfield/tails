Downloaded and burned to DVD with no problem.

A couple of questions/points:

1. What is the SHA256?

2. Does the new homepage check if Tor is running like check.torproject.org does? Because I then have to do that because of the rare occasion when there is a warning "You are not using Tor."

3. Will we get a spell check soon because misspellings can, after time, out us?
