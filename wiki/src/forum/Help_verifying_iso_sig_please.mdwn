Hi, Hopefully you can help me as I'm unable to verify the 0.14 signing key. 
I'm using GnuPG Shell on Ubuntu 12.04 and would appreciate a step by step advice on how to verify the iso sig. 

I've seen this page https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/verify_the_iso_image_using_gnome/index.en.html but its advice is out of date as seahorse plugins aren't supported for Ubuntu 12.04
The method suggested there using the browser doesn't work.

I tried decrypting the iso.gpg file but got:
"Decryption of file /home/Downloads/tails-i386-0.14/tails-i386-0.14.iso.pgp failure due to errors."

Presume this isn't the way to do it but I can't see another way to verify. Any help would be apreciated.

By the way the page https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#download isn't helpful as 90% of the links on verifying iso image link back to that same page - including the "instructions to check the ISO image integrity" links.
