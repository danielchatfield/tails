> I started the Same old problem thread and posted the last logs in that thread. This is further information because the notice is from the sync message: 

For your information, starting yet another thread (might be the sixth or something like this) about this class of problems is unlikely to help in any way.

> Failed to synchronize the clock!

Thank you from the added details!

> I also asked in that old thread if this problem could be the result of an on-going MITM attack.

It could be. As many, many other kinds of network disfunctionning. About the exact problem you are reporting in *this* thread: it may only be the result of MITM conducted between the exit node and the HTTP servers in our pool. So, if this is MITM, it's unlikely to be specifically targetted at you.

> So does this sync message help shed any light on that?

Not really. Sorry.

> Anyone else see thhis error?

Many, many.

> I'm connected despite the error.

This is great.

Stay tuned, many time sync -related improvements will be in the upcoming Tails 0.10.1.
