My older BIOS/PC doesn't accept booting with GUID boot block on USB. Tails USB Installer provides this only?
With Disk Utility i see MBR type on a USB with an working/booting tails on USB.The nonbooting/nonworking USB has a GUID boot block.
With MBR type it's working.
As a result of that i can't use the Tails USB Installer on these older PC's.
