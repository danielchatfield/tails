OK, answered, hplip has very limited network printing support (JetDirect only - certainly not the USB print server box connected to the router I am using).  Normal network setup of the printer resulted in the page form feeding ready to print, but nowt actually printing out - I was hoping to use hplip to diagnose the situation.
