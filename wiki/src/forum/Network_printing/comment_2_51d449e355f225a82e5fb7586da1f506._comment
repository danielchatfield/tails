Network printing can be very dangerous from the viewpoint of surveillance.

If Tails is preventing you from doing something, that might be a \"bug\", that might be Tails wisely preventing you from doing something which will cause harm.

Do you own the device on which you are using Tails?  The LAN where the network printer is located?  Is this a WiFi LAN?  If so, are all connections properly encrypted?

If you have a WiFi LAN with default settings and if you live in the Americas, EU, or much of Asia, or in major cities elsewhere, you should know that Google has probably mapped your WiFi LAN: they may know what devices you own including their individual MAC addresses and how they connect (encrypted or now), all geolocated to within a cubic meter.  And governments can and do request this kind of information.  (You can see how useful geolocation is if someone operating an lethal drone wants to precisely target an opposition newspaper; allegedly, Israeli drones and US drones have been used this way, although both governments deny that.)

If you are using a company network, be aware that most companies extensively monitor employee activities.  If you use a company provided laptop or phone, it is likely to be bugged.  So if possible you should never use company provided equipment for anything personal.

If possible, it is probably better to use a printer directly connected by the apropriate kind of cable to the device on which you are running Tails.  It is probably best to do anything not related to printing (in particular, reading downloaded PDF files or printing) while not connected to the internet at all.

This might not be possible for you, or might be inadvisable for other reasons (like possibly drawing attention to unusual behavior), but its something to think about.
