You just did.

It's all already stated in the documentation and numerous times in the forum. Why would you have the developers waste their time re-typing what they've already explained? Just to save some kid the bovva of looking at the [documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)?

You do, of course, understand that anyone who *seriously needs* Tails will have thought to *at the very least* READ THE DOCUMENTATION? Anyone else is just a timewaster.
