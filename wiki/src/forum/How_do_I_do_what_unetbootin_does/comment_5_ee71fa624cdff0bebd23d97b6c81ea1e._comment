I created multiple partitions on a bootable Tails pendrive under Ubuntu following a modified version of the above tutorial:

WATCH CLOSELY WHICH DISK YOU ARE WRITING TO  
YOU CAN OVERWRITE YOUR HARD DRIVE AND LOSE DATA  
(or at least your boot configuration and a lot of time)  

After creating the partition(s), mount the usb drive and the Tails iso, as root:

    mkdir /media/tails
    mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/tails
    mkdir /media/iso
    mount -o loop /path/to/tails-i386-0.10.2.iso /media/iso/

and copy the contents of the Tails iso:

    cp -r /media/iso/* /media/tails/.

move all cfgs to the root of the created partition

    mv /media/tails/isolinux/*.cfg /media/tails/.

rename isolinux.cfg to syslinux.cfg:

    mv isolinux.cfg syslinux.cfg

unmount everything

    umount /media/iso
    umount /media/tails

overwrite the mbr, install the bootloader:

    dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdX
    syslinux -i /dev/sdX1
    sync
