Hi,

Since version 0.17 or may be 0.17.1 I am no longer able to customize the Iceweasel Toolbars. I customize it to gain more screen space on the laptop and to add some addon buttons such as aardvark.

Is this a new security feature or a regression? Can it be related to some unusual browser-related variables in the Persistance volume?

Any other users experiencing this issue?

I have searched online and some mentioned corrupt local.rdf file, but this should not be the case since the file is created with each new session. I am not able to customize the toolbar before and after I install few addons.

Thnx

ZB
