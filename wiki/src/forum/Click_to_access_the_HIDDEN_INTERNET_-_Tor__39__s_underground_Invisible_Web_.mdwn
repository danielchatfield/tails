Hidden services are websites only accessible to Tor users. These can be run from tails simply by typing in a SECRET ADDRESS 

just click on the links below or cut and paste into your browser

A good place to start is the Hidden Wiki

<http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>

Using startpage for your ordinary world wide web searches? try the hidden site DuckDuckGo for added privacy

**Note : Hidden sites have .onion in their address and often have a scramble of letters. The format is different to sites which begin with www.**

Wikipedia - .onion is a pseudo-top-level domain host suffix (similar in concept to such endings as .bitnet and .uucp used in earlier times) designating an anonymous hidden service

**Note : Sometimes Hidden Services sites are down and will not work, try again later if this happens.**

The Hidden web is legal and full of information you wont find anywhere else. It has valuable privacy features which make tracing you even harder. Welcome to the OTHER SIDE OF THE INTERNET, the side your grandmother most probably didn't tell you about

Tails developers please consider displaying more information about .onion web sites with a clear link on the main page and on web browsers. Hidden services is a valuable part of Tor and I think under promoted by Tails at this point
