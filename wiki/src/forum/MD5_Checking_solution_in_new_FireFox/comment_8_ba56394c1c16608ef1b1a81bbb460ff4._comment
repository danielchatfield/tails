I think it's easier to document this way, but sincerely I'm unsure --
and not the right person to ask. Please raise this question on the
tails-dev mailing-list if you're interested in discussing this with
the folks who manage our documentation :)

Right, as long as \"a given signing key\" is really the same each
time :)

> But not for the release candidates?

No. I'd like to keep our RC release process and announce page as light
as possible. Also, I'm sorry, and I don't mean to be rude to anyone,
but I sincerely don't expect usable reports on a RC, in the time frame
given by our release process, from people who find it too hard to
(learn to) verify an OpenPGP signature as documented by us.
