Hullo Winston,

You speak of \"verifying the ISO\" and \"MD-5\" but to verify the ISO you need PGP or GPG.

MD-5 is a hash function used to check that a file has not been modified in transit, for example over a noisy line.  In the past it was used to guard against malicious tampering but is no longer considered safe for that; now SHA-512 is used instead.

PGP/GPG solve a completely different problem, verifying the authenticity of the ISO, that is that the ISO really was made by the Tails developers.  See
