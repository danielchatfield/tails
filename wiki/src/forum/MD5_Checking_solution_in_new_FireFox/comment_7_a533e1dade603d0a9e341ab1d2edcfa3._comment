The relatively few other distros that I've seen provide digital signatures for verifying the ISOs at all, do so for the *checksum files*.

( `gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.gpg SHA256SUMS.asc`) 

This includes Debian.

Why does Tails sign the ISO itself rather than a file containing the sha256sum for the ISO? 

>Of course OpenPGP provides stronger authenticity if you have improved the trust that you put in our OpenPGP key, but not really otherwise.

I recall a post from Tails that said that the trust in a given signing key automatically increases at least somewhat with each additional time it is used to verify an ISO. 

>That's why we provide this alternative method which by be easier for some people.

But not for the release candidates?
