Hi, I have the Tails public PGP key: 

Tails developers (signing key) <tails@boum.org> 0D24B36AA9A2A651787876451202821CBE2CD9C1 (Fingerprint)

downloaded from this page and also over at the keyserver https://keyserver.pgp.com just to verify it. Indeed it's trustable.
I then checked the signature file tails-i386-0.18.iso.pgp against the Tails ISO tails-i386-0.18.iso and after a while I got this error:

*tails-i386-018.iso.pgp Not enough information to check signature validity.*
*Signed on 2013-05-16 16:58 by tails@boum.org (Key ID: 0xBE2CD9C1).*
*The validity of the signature cannot be verified.*

Accidentally I'm on Windows and using Kleopatra in the GPG4Win bundle (Menu File->Decrypt/Verify Files...).
I'll be trying to verify it on Linux too.
Meanwhile any thoughts?

Thank you
