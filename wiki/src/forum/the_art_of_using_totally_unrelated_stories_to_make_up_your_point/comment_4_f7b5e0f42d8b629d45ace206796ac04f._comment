> Confrontational?? This sounded a bit religious, like do not ever commit a Tails blasphemy over here and dare to point out a weakness. lol !

It's not about blasphemy, it's about not wasting everyone's time,
and about avoiding feeding irrational fears with FUD. OP pointed
out a few example topics that have many times been subject to
OMG-style ill-informed FUD, sometimes spread by people who not
only don't understand much of what they are talking of (which is
totally fine), but insist they're right even after being proven
wrong, sometimes even going as far as accusing us of various
conspiracies when we don't buy their point. This is the kind of
communication behavior I was referring to with \"confrontational
post\", and it is not welcome here. That's why I'd rather not
encourage posts that risk very much to trigger this pattern.

> Criticism is supposed to be encouraged not frowned upon.

Pointing out weaknesses is totally welcome, when backed with facts. A few important bugs in Tails were discovered and reported this way in the last years. Please do report such issues!

On the other hand, criticism of the \"OMG why don't you do this and that you're too lame\" kind is counter-productive and not encouraged, especially when it's the third time in six months someone comes up with exactly the same one. Surprised, uh? :)
