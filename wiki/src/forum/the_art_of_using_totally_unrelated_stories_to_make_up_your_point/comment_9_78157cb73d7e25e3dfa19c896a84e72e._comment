5 here.

@ 6,7,8:

Glad you enjoyed it!

@ 8:

You are correct: comment 5 was intended as a parody of the (bad) \"parody\" in the OP, and of certain posters here who invariably respond to threads on serious privacy issues with angry (and unfunny) mockery.

And one of the underlying points is that the elements of my \"parody\" are not fictional!

(The best parodies stick very close to the truth; the perfect parody *is* the truth.)

It is in fact literally true that *Americans pay about eight times more for substandard broad-band service than many Europeans and Asians pay for superior service*.   And through a little known \"inversion\" in the roles of \"cable TV providers\" and \"telephone companies\", Comcast now owns or maintains most of the wires carried on American telephone poles, while US telecoms like Verizon focus on cell phone service and related infrastructure, such as cell phone towers, which are much less expensive to build and maintain than buried fiber optic cables.  These phenomena directly affect the lives of most Americans, but very few Americans know these about them.  The fact that Comcast owns NBC is part of the reason why not.

The corporate structure of Comcast is opaque and appears designed to hide the identity of the other companies owned by Comcast-NBC-Universal.  (I have seen estimates in the neighborhood of some two hundred subsidiary companies.)  But it is apparently true that Comcast owns companies which cater to the US \"home security\" market. And Comcast has certainly applied for patents on amazingly intrusive surveillance techniques:

* a set-top box which reports what physical activities people appear to be doing in front of their TV (Comcast says it only wants to know if you are ignoring ads, not whether you are getting it on while watching \"30 Rock\", but the potential for abuse will be lost on no-one here)

* other home surveillance technology (similar to devices marketed by Google), which Comcast (and Google) hope to make mandatory throughout North America, Europe, well, actually, everywhere, which will inventory all your electronic devices by IPv6 address and monitor minute by minute how much power they are using

One might also mention home surveillance technology which is sold as \"helpful\" monitoring for CO gas (Carbon Monoxide), Uranium gas, and other (sometimes dubious) physical safety threats inside the home, which the surveillance companies are bullying American lawmakers into making *mandatory* in more and more locations.  

That is worrisome enough, but enterprising US companies are already offering *bugged* versions of these devices, which replace the genuine \"shell\" with tiny cameras/microphones and radio transmitters.  I don't which is worse: the fact that some of these bugged versions no longer function as gas/smoke detectors, or the fact that some of them *do* retain some of their \"legitimate\" functionality.  These same companies have offered bugged smoke detectors as \"nanny cams\" for decades, but unlike typical smoke detectors, the new generation of \"gas detectors\" and \"radiation detectors\" are designed so that you cannot open up the cases in order to check whether or not you have an unbugged example.  

Indeed, one of the two companies which supply most smoke/gas detectors sold in North America actually *sells both bugged and unbugged versions of its best-selling CO detector on its own website!*

Who could imagine that supposedly freedom loving Americans would tolerate such chicanery?  But most likely they simply don't yet know about it, even though the evidence is right there in plain sight, if only someone is permitted to tell them where to look.

The ambitions of the surveillance companies are truly horrifying.  It is a measure of how far the world has evolved towards Big Brotherism that so few people even find set top boxes which monitor our activities inside our own homes as anything to be concerned about anymore.  But privacy is not dead, unless we citizens allow huge corporations like Comcast to kill it.  I hope that if Americans are not outraged at Comcast's incessant spying of what Americans are doing inside their own homes, perhaps they will become outraged once they become aware of Comcast's unmerciful price-gouging.  *Surveillance companies view us all as prey items*.  Don't believe the PR flacks and politicians who tell you that all this surveillance \"is for your own good\".

But my parodic efforts in this thread have been eclipsed by The Onion, whose recent parody of certain right wing \"conspiracy theories\" was so convincing that Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell actually cited it in an official letter of inquiry:

    http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/mcconnell-duffel-blog/

I honor the Onion, and I urge everyone who can to obtain and read a copy of the book by Susan Crawford, \"Captive Audience\", which is not, alas, a parody, but the plain truth.
