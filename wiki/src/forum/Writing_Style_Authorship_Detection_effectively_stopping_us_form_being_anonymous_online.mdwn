I think this is one of the biggest issues and needs more focus.

Everybody has ever written one or another post in a clearnet blog comment, forum...

When we post over Tor we can still be traced because of our Writing Style. We tend to repeat the same phrases, mistakes and have our favorite vocabulary and so on. This can connect our clearnet identity with out anonymous identity.

There is Anonymouth but I don't understand it. I don't know if it's quite ready yet.

What are the alternatives?

This is a horror scenario. If we all use a de-personalizer / writing style obfuscator our messages will look like garbage will be difficult to read will be difficult to understand?

What is the future of being anonymous online? No more posting of text? Only reading? Only one word communication? No more real communication? Only posting links?
