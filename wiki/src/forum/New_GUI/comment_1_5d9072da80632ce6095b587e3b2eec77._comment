> Is there any way to install a new GUI in tails? If so, can someone explain to me how, i'm new to tails and linux in general.

While it is theoretically possible to install an alternate GUI on tails, I would highly recommend against it, as it would be a rather complicated and not at all easy for somebody with no Linux experience to do.

in other words, No there is no easy way to install a different GUI in Tails, and the while its theoretically possible to do its not at all a supported feature in tails.
