>Second, this forum is about Tails. It's not the right place to start discussions about the new Liberté forum. Instead, discussions about Liberté should happen where the Liberté community lives.

What is the big deal? I go over there and ask a few questions comparing TAILS to Libertine and the forum is disabled. I come over here and get the naughty naughty lecture. 

>If there are people interested to discuss \"Tails vs. Liberté: whatever stuff\", probably they should get themselves organized and create a new discussion space that suit these needs.

What we need is a place to communicate with the users and developers of TAILS and Libertine. Why is it important that we use open source software? Open discussion is important for the same reason. Where would be a better place for this? 

>About censorship: this forum was never announced formally as a uncensored one: we often remove spam, our antispam filter often gets dumb and makes mistakes, and we may delete other kinds of posts.

Of course. I meant a forum that doesn't censor things like comparisons of security practices. Is that what you intend to censor?
