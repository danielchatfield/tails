Why is it either-or?

Those who can help with work on establishing a Tor forum can continue to do so.

In the meantime, more people will be able to use the existing Tor-talk mailing list.

Not only that, but if this \"Tor-Talk Mailing List Guide\" is received well (especially by the Tor people themselves), then perhaps a decision will be made to endorse and publish said guide on the Tor web site itself (even placing a prominent link on the comments page for each and every post made to the Tor blog). Perhaps even, given all of the concerns and obstacles that have been raised with regard to establishing a forum, the entire idea will be dropped or indefinitely postponed in favor of the \"publicize the mailing list and broaden its user base\" approach just described.
