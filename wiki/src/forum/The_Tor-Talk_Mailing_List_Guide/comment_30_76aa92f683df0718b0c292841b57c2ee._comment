I read lots from him.

> As a rule, I think it is wise not to become to arrogant in assuming that we don't need to think something through, or that some potential issue could not possibly be worth thinking about. A better approach is to prioritize our effort, but to also bear in mind that our adversaries may well think of something we have not, and use the innovation to harm us. The history of cryptography (and the shorter history of computing) is full of examples of experts overlooking a flaw, with disastrous consequences. So we need to try to keep an open mind and not fall into ossified ways of thinking about security/anonymity.

Distrusting the mail provider and to assume it to be compromised or even adversary controlled is basic threat modelling. Posting to Tor-Talk is a very easy task if we assume Tor to be safe. There are far bigger problems. Relying on the trust in a mail provider will never work. Email is always a single point of failure and easy to take over. It was more than cheap to dispose any gains of security from the mail provider for this particular task. If you feel better with SSL, it won't hurt using it. SSL has it's own major flaws I don't want to go into here but you easily find it when searching.

What are the remaining obstacles?
