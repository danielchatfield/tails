Right now its only bla bla. There is no draft. Its no current law. What could one say? How is it related to this guide?

I know Tor is censored in China.

Is Tor illegal by law in China? I have no idea how things work in China. Searching for \"Tor\" \"Law\" \"China\" didn't bring results.

Are people in China punished on a by case by face base disregarding law? Do they follow their law?

And most important: assumed Tor is illegal in China. What does prevent you from using Tor-Talk if you can use Tails forum?

This is not a general guide for China users. If you are not allowed to use Tor & Tails in the first place you are consequently not allowed to use the Tails forum and you are not allowed to use Tor-Talk thus there is no difference thus outside the scope of this guide.
