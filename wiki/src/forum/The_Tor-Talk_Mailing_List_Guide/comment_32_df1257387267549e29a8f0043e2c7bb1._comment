You don't.

You are messing up different purposes.

Encrypt mail end-to-end and SSL is for purpose \"never ever let a Tor exit get my username/password and keep the content of my mail private\". Fine. This is absolutely not the case here.

Our purpose is \"post anonymous public messages to a public mailing list\".

A tool failing for one purpose must not fail for all purposes.

Thinking creatively. Exist far easier and cheaper ways such as forcing or bribing a Tails or Debian developer of a package included in Tails to add rootkit malware sending IP and all keystrokes to the adversary hidden service. Open source does not help because no one checks that all the checksums are made from the source code.

The weak link are the developers not the some random user asking a random question on Tor-Talk.

Impossible for developers. Trust can only be build and trolls can only be defeated using pseudonyms. Debates without pseudonyms have much lower quality. Just compare any onion forum or this one with other specialized forum or mailing list.

> This is why I hope that the proposed \"new style\" Tails and Tor forums will allow anonymous posting sans registration

I think if they choose an answer centric forum not an debate centric forum anonymous postings will work.
