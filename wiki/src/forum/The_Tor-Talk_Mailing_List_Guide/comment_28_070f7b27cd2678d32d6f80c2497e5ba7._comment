> I have a followup question to something the author of the tutorial said in version 2: I have a general concern about servers, even owned by trustworthy activist-friendly operators, which act both as Tor nodes and as webmail servers, for example. Could that be a security/anonymity hazard? For example, a Riseup server which was being used by a sister project (with permission) was recently seized in New York City (and then returned). What if a Tor server (especially an Exit server) were seized and turned out to also hold webmail user accounts? That could be really bad.

Tor design can manage some evil nodes.

Seizing the mail server is bad for regular users but this is not the topic here. This is just about using Tor-Talk.

Tor design allows to connect to evil servers. If it wouldn't there would be no point to use Tor at all.

In the case of Tor-Talk the mail provider is ONLY used as necessity to post to Tor-Talk. The content of the mail account can be public and server controlled by the adversary. Same goes for the Tor exit. The same goes for Tor-Talk itself.

It all does not matter. This guide of course assumes that the

* hardware
* the operating system
* Tails
* the Tor software
* all Debian packages
* the Tor network the entry node and the middle node is trustworthy

Feel free the question any of the assumptions of the Tor network or any of these points but please not in the Tor-Talk mailing list guide. If you seriously distrust any of the assumptions it becomes a general Tails topic. I can only talk about one piece of the puzzle and not explain the whole world in one guide. This guide of course assumes you trust Tor & Tails and have a general clue how its working. It can not explain it to someone who does not know how to move the mouse.
