Version 2 of the tutorial is now at Tor-talk

* <https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2012-December/026944.html>

I have a followup question to something the author of the tutorial said in version 2: I have a general concern about servers, even owned by trustworthy activist-friendly operators, which act both as Tor nodes and as webmail servers, for example.  Could that be a security/anonymity hazard?  For example, a Riseup server which was being used by a sister project (with permission) was recently seized in New York City (and then returned).  What if a Tor server (especially an Exit server) were seized and turned out to also hold webmail user accounts?  That could be really bad.
