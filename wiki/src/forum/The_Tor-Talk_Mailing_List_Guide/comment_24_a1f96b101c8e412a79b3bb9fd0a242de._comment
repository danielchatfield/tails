> Thanks, but as the recent Petraeus-Broadwell incident should have reminded everyone, in general

Sorry, Petraeus story has no connection to this discussion. This account was never and will never be used by me for anything else than talking to Tor-Talk.

> sharing a webmail account is probably not a good idea for soooo many reasons.

There is only one problem: someone changes the password and I have to create a new account. What other problems?

> And of course unless someone changes the password it is now an open account

Yes, open account. This was the purpose. Open as posting in this forum. What's the problem?

> whose inbox can be read by everyone in the world, right?

Yes. Why does anyone care? Everything send with this account is already readable in public by everyone in the world. That was the purpose and point.

> Could be problem if automated \"confirmation\" emails arrived, for example.

What do you mean? What kind of harm does it to me?
