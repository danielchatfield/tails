If you don't know you are not ready for anonymity. You know too little. Learn more. Hint: find the hidden wiki.

Discussion forum.

If you want to get ride of your dictator go on street meet up with many people who share your believes go demonstrate fight for free elections elect democratic parties.

If you want more acceptance for homosexuals go on street tell people start a website with your name go into talk show and so on.

If you want your island to become independent show your flag everywhere and encourage other people to do the same. Go to talk show and so on.

If you want to promote privacy and civil liberties install Tails start up the Tor browser and... Oh sorry that doesn't work out.
