> Just compare any onion forum 

There are such things?  Is there a privacy and civil liberties promoting onion forum?  What are the risks of benefits of trying to participate?

@ \"Tails\":

Safe communication between users and developers appears to be fraught with danger for all, unfortunately, and it appears that chat and email (or anything requiring registering user accounts anywhere) may be too dangerous in the current environment of global oppression.

Which doesn't mean that I intend to give up trying.

I'd like to see a discussion with the i2p developers on the pros and cons of possibly using i2p to try to distribute manuals on privacy-related issues, such as details of how modern country-scale surveillance systems work, and detailed information on the nasty corporations which supply them.
