@ Comment 24:

If you have never read anything by Bruce Schneier, I think you might benefit from doing so.

As a rule, I think it is wise not to become to arrogant in assuming that we don't need to think something through, or that some potential issue could not possibly be worth thinking about.  A better approach is to prioritize our effort, but to also bear in mind that our adversaries may well think of something we have not, and use the innovation to harm us.   The history of cryptography (and the shorter history of computing) is full of examples of experts overlooking a flaw, with disastrous consequences.  So we need to try to keep an open mind and not fall into ossified ways of thinking about security/anonymity.

@ the author of the Tutorial:

I am not sure your advice will work for all of us, but I appreciate your effort and I think that I will be able to use at least some of your suggestions.
