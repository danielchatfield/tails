I am not sure that I understand you correctly, but I don't think that plain-text protocols are acceptable in direct end-to-end communications via Tor circuits, particularly when sending username/password combinations.  (News stories from 2007-2008 about the Tor research of Dan Egerstadt should suggest some reasons why; bear in mind correlation attacks and think creatively.  Don't forget that one of our adversaries basic approaches to to \"collect now and use later\".)

But I agree with some points you made:

* flaws in SSL are well known
* we must try to operate under the assumption that organizations with which we deal are collaborating with at least one (probably many more) adversaries

Our adversaries may seem to have all the advantages in the War on People, but citizens do retain some intrinsic advantages:

* the sheer variety of protocols and consumer equipment still create some difficulties for our adversaries

* commercial and interagency and international rivalries can potentially be leveraged to foul up some of their efforts

* using the full weight of all their technology may be too costly or too slow in some cases, so there is value in doing anything we can do to avoid making snooping too easy and cheap (financially and even politically)

* new technologies like programmable Linux packet radio, citizen local-nets, and even (how ironic) cheap consumer drones (put that raspberry pi on a drone and make an emergency citizen router, for use when some government flunky kills the internet in your locale) may have the potential to tip the balance in the favor of the citizen engaged in education, organization, and speaking freely

* when all is said and done, there are still more of us than there are of them; strangely enough, if they kill the internet, that may actually tip the balance in favor of the masses in some situations.

As for assuming we are dealing with the enemy, I think the history of Tor shows how the intelligence agencies are not infrequently too clever by half.  Credible statements indicate that many employees of our adversary organizations feel that Tor was used for some time as a valuable intelligence collection program but that they (the agencies) \"lost control\" of the technology, and for some time Tor appears to have served as a fairly effective anonymizer.  With all the mandated backdoors in encryption currently coming on-line worldwide, this may no longer be true in the near future, which is why we need to move ahead with local citizen internet movements which potentially bypass corporations entirely.

My point is that when the user base of Tor/Tails interacts with the developers, it is important to do so anonymously (maybe even the developers should be more anonymous in future).  The general idea is to limit the damage should one party to the conversation be an enemy operative.  Also, any procedures which avoid requiring any entity to keep user account information at all should be avoided, on the principle that if no-one keeps the data, it cannot be lost, stolen, or seized.  This is why I hope that the proposed \"new style\" Tails and Tor forums will allow anonymous posting sans registration (despite the potentially increased moderation burden).
