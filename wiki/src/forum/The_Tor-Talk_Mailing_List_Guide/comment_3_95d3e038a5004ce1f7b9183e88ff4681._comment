Hang on a second.  

* many of us can use this forum (current iwiki version) but not yet been able to post to Tor-talk
* you have stated that you want Tor/Tails users to ask questions on Tor-talk rather than this forum
* the OP is trying to explain, for the benefit of community members, how to use the Tor-talk mailing list without giving up all pretense of anonymity

Isn't the OP helping accomplish what you want?  Wouldn't it be a win-win if the thread succeeds in helping migrate some discussions from this forum to Tor-talk?
