> Here are two followup requests, addressed to anyone who can explain:

Please open a new topic, check the todo list and if necessary open a todo item.

> About China, strictly speaking this is not about Tails itself, but I think it is a very important topic. I think Chinese citizens could and probably should provide a huge portion of the Tails user base, and I think the Tails community should be doing everything it can to help ensure that people in China can reach the uncensored internet, and evade government surveillance of dissident communications. And even the central government admits that more whistleblowing is needed in China, so we should try to help with that too.

This is a guide for using Tor-Talk. For a general guide to Tails click on the Documentation button on the right. China, Chinese censorship, censorship circumvention are, how to use bridges are general Tor & Tails topics and I can't explain the whole word in one guide.

> I feel these requests are \"on-topic\", or at least \"on-point\" in that I am attempting to address the issue of \"off-topic\" discussions in this forum. Thanks to everyone who has contributed, and please, more of the same! If I and others with similar concerns get enough ideas, I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to make progress in the new year.

Filling up the Tor-Talk thread with off topic won't help the Tor-Talk guide getting better. It just wastes the readers time.

Please stick to questions related to how to use Tor-Talk.
