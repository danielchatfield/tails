Why? It's already answered in the guide.

Q: Does the email provider need to be reachable by https / SSL? What if the signup form is unencrypted?

A: https / SSL would be nice, but it's not required. Traffic snoopers are of no concern to us - as said above - we assume the mail provider to be an adversary.

This is NOT a guide for a general anonymous mail account. This is ONLY for talking to Tor-Talk. For this purpose SSL is not required.
