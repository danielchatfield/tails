Don’t like to think too much
It makes me think too much
It keeps my mind on my mind
Don’t want to see too much
It makes me see too much
Sometimes I’d rather be blind

All the things that they’re saying and doing
When they pass me by just fills me up with noise
It overloads me
I wanna disconnect myself
Pull my brain stem out and unplug myself
I want nothing right now

I wanna pull it out, yea
I wanna pull it out, yea
I wanna break it on down, hey
I wanna pull it out, yea, yea
Disconnect myself
Disconnect myself
I wanna see it go down, yea
Disconnect myself

A thousand miles an hour going nowhere fast
Going through the details of your past
Talk about your damage and you’re wasting my time
Wanna be the king and queen? stand in line
All the numbers and the codes and the facts
Backed by the rumors and the figures and the stats
I think I’m going to download my mind

I wanna pull it out, yea
I wanna pull it out, yea, hey
I wanna break it on down, yea
Disconnect myself
I wanna pull it out, yea, yea
I wanna pull it out, hey, yea
Disconnect myself
Disconnect myself, hey

I wanna disconnect myself (do it)
I wanna disconnect myself (get it)
I wanna pull my brain stem out (do it)
I wanna disconnect myself right now

Too damn bad if at the end of the day
The only thoughts in your brain are the things that they say
What a waste
Too damn bad if at the end of the line
You got no idea of what’s on your own mind
You got no one to blame but yourself
Too much to know too much to see
It might mean something to you but it’s nothing to me

Just another ad for someone’s version of how they think it should be
I wanna disconnect myself
Pull my brain stem out and unplug myself
I want nothing right now

I wanna pull it out, yea
I wanna disconnect myself
I wanna see it go down, yea
Disconnect myself
I wanna pull it out, hey, yea
Disconnect myself
I wanna see it go down, hey
I wanna disconnect myself, yea

I wanna pull it out, yea
I wanna pull it out, yea, yea
Disconnect myself
I wanna see it go down, hey
I wanna disconnect myself
Disconnect myself
I wanna break it on down, yea
Disconnect myself, yea
