>A system that needs frequent patching is not secure, even if it is simple and quick to apply those patches. By analogy, if you owned a car that frequently blew up or ran into walls because the brakes or steering failed, the fact that you could replace the bumpers or tires yourself would not make the car \"safer.\" A secure system is one that works correctly under stress and under attack -- it does not need frequent patching.

The proper analogy in the modern day case of agile software development would be if you drove the car while the manufacturer was still adding features, changing designs, and testing it.

If the developers stopped developing and spent all of their time debugging, you would end up with a perfectly safe product that is already outdated and that doesn't have the desired features.
