The version of iceweasel shipped in Tails 0.12.1 is 10.0.5esr-1~bpo60+1 so, yes, it is affected by those security issues. This will be fixed in the next release but I can't tell you exactly when this will happen.

Unfortunately, the Tails project doesn't have enough human ressources to publish a release for every security annoucement affecting it. But we are working in this direction. For your interest see [[todo/incremental_upgrades]] and [[todo/automated_builds_and_tests]].
