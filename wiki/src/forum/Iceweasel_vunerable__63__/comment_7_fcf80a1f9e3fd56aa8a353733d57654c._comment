>A system that needs frequent patching is not secure, even if it is simple and quick to apply those patches. By analogy, if you owned a car that frequently blew up or ran into walls because the brakes or steering failed, the fact that you could replace the bumpers or tires yourself would not make the car \"safer.\" A secure system is one that works correctly under stress and under attack -- it does not need frequent patching.
