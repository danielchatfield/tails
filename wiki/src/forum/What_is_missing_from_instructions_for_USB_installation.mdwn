Here is what I found to be missing from the web page entitled - Installing onto a USB Stick - at: https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html

N.B.1: If you have downloaded the latest TAILS ISO file, and plan on installing it onto a USB, then completing the following is essential to being able to complete the ISO installation successfully.

N.B.2: These steps are only relevant if you click on the option for Upgrade from ISO when running the TAILS USB Installer and your USB has not been properly formatted by a previously successful installation using the TAILS USB Installer, e.g. you created a successfully bootable USB installation of a previous ISO image file using the dd command without formatting the USB.

With Applications>System Tools>Disk Utility do the following preparation to your USB prior to attempting to run Tails>Tails USB Installer:

1. Format the USB device to have a Master Boot Record

2. Create a partition formatted using FAT for /dev/sdx1 where x is an alpha character identified by Disk Utility, set the bootable flag for the partition, and make sure you name the partition /dev/sdx1 where you replace x with the alpha character identified by Disk Utility.

After these items are complete, then proceed with the instructions on the web page for - Installing onto a USB Stick.
