Reasons for arriving at this possible conclusio:

- Having just created a LibraryThing account I was able to add 11 collections before the feature while continuing through the motions of letting me add a collection actually without error failed to save it.

- Using delicious, i) predictive text stopped working completely on this release of Tails, ii) though it has returned two or three times while typing tags, and also iii) most recently started to intermittently work but not displaying the tag I actually needed for the webpage.

- Using the previous version of Tails I was able to go through the motions of creating posts but none were ever posted (though could have been an overloaded moderator ;)

I've just downloaded google-chrome and have been able to add a LibraryThing collection.

I've just booted Knoppix 6.7 with Iceweasel 5 and LibraryThing works OK.

I've rebooted Tails and upgraded Iceweasel to 6.0 in testing, apart from breaking a few plugins LibraryThing is working fine, delicious has just upgraded the website and is badly broken!
