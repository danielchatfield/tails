\"I'm having the same issue when trying to boot from hirens. I get the welcome screen and it begins counting down to automatically boot Tails but it never does. The timer simply resets. When I hit enter nothing happens. When I switch to fail-safe and hit enter nothing happens. Hope someone can help with this. The only thing I can think of is that when the instructions were written to add Tails to a Hirens disc it was when Tails was on a lower release. 0.1x If anyone is familiar with hirens and/or linux or grub4dos please let me know what you think.\"

I am having this exact same problem! I am using TAILS 0.15 and Hirens 15.1 Restored edition.
