... just to add, there should be a hardware reset switch on your router which I would expect to kill all log files.

You would have to use the macchanger each time before connecting to your network to retain a shred of plausible deniability though. However, if the logs include more info than just mac addresses it might be relatively easy to realise that it's just the same interface thats connected under a different pseudonym.

Perhaps OP could mix it up by using wired connection for his default home connection and wireless with mac changer for his tails related trafic?
