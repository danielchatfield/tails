Anyone else ever get these? It was so bad for a while that I emailed ixquick.com and they replied that they were working on it. It's rarer now but still happens occasionally.

An error occurred during a connection to ixquick.com.

SSL received a record with an incorrect Message Authentication Code.

(Error code: ssl_error_bad_mac_read)

Any benign explanation for this?
