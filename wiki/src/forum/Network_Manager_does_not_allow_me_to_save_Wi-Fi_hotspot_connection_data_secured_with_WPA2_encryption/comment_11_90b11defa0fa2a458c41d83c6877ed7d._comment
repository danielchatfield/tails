>I'm typing this comment from Tails 0.13 now. x)

I said that but I have some questions:

— Is it safe to post comments, even if posted anonymously, through Tor in Tails?

— Can I login to surface Web sites that use registration of accounts (say e-mail provider, YouTube, etc.) securely through Tor in Tails?

— What about downloading files? What is the best method to guarantee my privacy and security?

— Can I play audio and/or video files in a secure manner? What about opening other types of files?

Thanks in advance.
