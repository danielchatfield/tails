I understood that you do not manage to connect to this wireless network. But maybe I'm mistaken.

So I have two questions:

  - Did you ever managed to connect to this network using a different Linux system also running GNOME?
  - Can you successfully connect to other wireless networks?

Otherwise, it might be easier for us to diagnose your problem if you send a proper [[bug report|/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]], see especially the section on [[no Internet access|/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting#no_internet_access]].
