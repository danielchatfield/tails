>If you're copying & pasting the key, try hitting backspace once and see if you can click connect. I have this happen once in a while because gedit would assuume I wanted the line-break copied as well.

This is what was going on, after all. Thank you all, the issue is now solved. Sometimes we miss these obvious things. I'm typing this comment from Tails 0.13 now. x)

>It may very well be. Have you searched the web for similar issues?

I didn't find anything like my issue, though it could probably be explained by copy-pasting the key with the line-break as well, since gedit assumed it, and it's probably something so obvious that only I missed it. I kinda feel bad about it.

>Could you please run /sbin/lsmod | grep -E '(brcm|bcm|b43)' in a Terminal and paste the output here?

Just in case and while I'm at it, here it goes:

    amnesia@amnesia:~$ /sbin/lsmod | grep -E '(brcm|bcm|b43)'
    brcmsmac              447926  0 
    mac80211              167554  1 brcmsmac
    brcmutil               12785  1 brcmsmac
    cfg80211              117608  2 brcmsmac,mac80211
