>I understood that you do not manage to connect to this wireless network. But maybe I'm mistaken.

Nope, you're correct; I didn't manage to connect to this Wi-Fi hotspot due to this very problem.

>Did you ever managed to connect to this network using a different Linux system also running GNOME?

It has also occurred with Ubuntu 11.04/11.10/12.04 LTS Live CD and actual installation sessions.

>Can you successfully connect to other wireless networks?

I probably can but I can't test it because all the Wi-Fi hotspots in my neighborhood that my PC can detect are secured with some level of encryption. I guess the current workaround is to connect directly through Ethernet, though it's not very practical due to where the modem and router are located.

(forgot to double-check the last time; if someone could please remove the previous comment, I'd appreciate it ^^' )
