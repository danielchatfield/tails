I can't seem to get ssh running with .onion address.

for example
# ssh user@alsdkfdfsifjsdf.onion

(made up domain)

results in 
ERROR: Got error response from SOCKS server: 1 (general SOCKS server failure).
FATAL: failed to begin relaying via SOCKS.

The message appears very quickly so it doesn't seem it is even going through the network at all.

It appears to work fine specifying a normal domain or ip address.

Isn't ssh to .onion supposed to be supported?  What is the workaround.

Using the newest version of tails with no changes.
