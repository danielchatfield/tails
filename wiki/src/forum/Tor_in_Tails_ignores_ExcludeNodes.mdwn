I use Tails 0.12.1, and must confirm that ExcludeNodes or ExcludeExitNodes directives remain without effect in 50% of cases. I can not understand why it sometimes works and sometimes not.

Can anyone explain why a distribution located on DVD-R seemingly behaves at RANDOM?

Who are the network "Controllers" who can "manually" change the flow?

AND, why even after of hours after initial connection appear 1-HOP-connections?
