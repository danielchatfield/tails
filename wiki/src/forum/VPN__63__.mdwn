Sorry if this has been covered, but I did do a search, and I could find nothing helpful.

The point is that I am concerned that it would be clear to anyone who investigated that I am using Tor. I would like to change this.

I understand a VPN is a way to achieve this. 

First, can someone explain in plain English what a VPN is and how it achieves anonymity. I looked at Wiki, etc, but I do not understand.

Second, would it be possible for someone as clueless with computers as me to use it with Tails? I know nothing of code.

Third, how would I optain a VPN anonymously.

Thank you.
