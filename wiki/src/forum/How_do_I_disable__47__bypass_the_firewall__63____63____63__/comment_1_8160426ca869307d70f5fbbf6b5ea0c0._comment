This known issue has already been discussed on [[todo/add_support_for_free_wifi_hotspots]]. An \"unsafe browser\" should be shipped in next Tails version as it has been implemented in the [`feature/unsafe-browser` branch](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/feature/unsafe-browser).
