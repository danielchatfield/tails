    When Tails greeter appears, in the Welcome to Tails window, click on the Yes button. Then click on the Forward button to switch to the Administration password window.

    In the Administration password window, specify a password of your choice in both the Password and Verify Password text boxes. Then click on the Login button to start the GNOME Desktop.


Now,if I cklick on the Login Button,the Tais greeter appears and Welcoomes me to the Tails Wondow...

It worked fine for almost a month,but when I tried to log in just today,I won't get past the greeter, I cannot get on the desktop
