@ thread starter:

It's good that you're vigilant and suspicious, but luckily you're incorrect. The Tails website was not hacked.

You see, `dl.amnesia.boum.org` resolves to many different download mirrors. Some of these may sync the files in such a way that they don't keep the original date, which explains why you saw different different dates on the files. It's still the same content, as the hash comparisions verify.

Also, `dl.amnesia.boum.org` does not support HTTPS, so if you try to use it you will get a certificate error. To autheticate your download, use verify the supplied OpenPGP signature against our signing key.

And finally, the weird `dl.amnesia.boum.org` resolved to Pirate bay issue. One of our mirrors apparently also hosts a Pirate Bay mirror, and the admin probably only screwed up the virtual hosts file in the apache configuration. Fun times! :)

So, as you can see, nothing is really out of order (except perhaps a mirror with a messed up vhost file). Please report this back to the reddit thread.

@ Tails Signing Key has been modified!:

Proof? It's the good old one now at least.
