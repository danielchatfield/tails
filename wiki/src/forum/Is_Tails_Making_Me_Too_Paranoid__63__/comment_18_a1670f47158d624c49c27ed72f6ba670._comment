And I hope you realize that as long as people who comment under Tails are more concerned about Tails reputation and scarring of users when it is proven to be a false alarm, than with the possibility that *IF* Tails website has been hacked users should be immediately warned as long as there is reasonable doubt there could be danger, then perhaps they are correct in being scared regardless of how safe tails website is.

Mind you, I love what you do and I am immensely grateful that Tails exists and there are developers in the world generous and capable enough to try to make the world a better place. FUD can be scary, potentially ward of some users, and OP should have done a better job confirming things. I am not contesting any of that.

I am contesting that instead of, for example, editing the OP message from Tails Website Hacked - WARNING to Tails Website Hacked - False Alarm in order to prevent users being scarred, you are concerned over the reputation effects of a post of a well-meaning user trying to help.

No need for this comment to turn into a flame, just had to speak that out loud and defend what I believe to be correct. You obviously disagree and that's fine and perhaps even more correct regarding how mass psicology works.
