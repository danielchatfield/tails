> And I hope you realize that as long as people who comment under Tails are more concerned about Tails reputation and scarring of users when it is proven to be a false alarm, than with the possibility that IF Tails website has been hacked users should be immediately warned as long as there is reasonable doubt there could be danger, then perhaps they are correct in being scared regardless of how safe tails website is.

I think you are pushing what was said in comment 17 a tad too far.

Any way, reputation is important as it is highly related to trust, which is critical for a project like Tails. If users move to less secure alternatives because that they cannot trust Tails (for the wrong reasons) I'd say it pretty clearly hurts the users. This is why at least *I* care about reputation.

That said, it's definitely great with users looking out for potential compromises. But there is the obvious question of what \"reasonable doubt\" means in what you described above. If every glitch like this result in this kind of situation I think you know what will happen to Tails' trustability. I simply want a higher threshold for \"reasonable\" than this, which I believe is better for everyone.

I must say that what's really worrying in this whole drama is the lack of signature verification. It's simple, really: you cannot be sure of what you get when you download a Tails image if you haven't done *all* of the below:

1. You have established [[trust in the Tails signing key|doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key]].

2. You have [[verified the image's signature|download#index3h1]].

No one apparently did this, which immediately would have cleared things up. What people did, however, was comparing cryptographic hashes, and since they still were the same as those of a known good copy (at least it was downloaded before the alleged compromise), that at least should have thrown some very serious doubt over the \"Tails is hacked\" claims.

> I am contesting that instead of, for example, editing the OP message from Tails Website Hacked - WARNING to Tails Website Hacked - False Alarm in order to prevent users being scarred, you are concerned over the reputation effects of a post of a well-meaning user trying to help.

First of all I don't think it was a Tails developer that renamed this forum thread. It happened in [commit 275f516](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=commit;h=275f51618e1043eabcefbf2f74b7cd8a57478a42) with `127.0.0.1` as author, which means it was made anonymously (i.e. not using the Tails account) through the website's forum.

Second, it's quite clear that the thread starter was well-meaning and that's also the reason why, IMHO, we dealt with him/her in a rather forgiving manner. Shit happens.

@ comment 21:

> Pick one.

You try to come about this like there's a contradiction. Reputation isn't the same thing as marketshare, or whatever. I hope it's clear what was meant w.r.t. reputation now.
