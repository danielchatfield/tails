I hope you realize that this has hurt Tails' reputation and probably scared users away from our using project ever again. People are much happier to spread the word about a *potential* (a word which is often ignored once read/heard, BTW) compromise, than the news of it being a false alarm. Likewise, in the long run people are much more likely to remember only the \"shocking\"/\"surprising\" news than the subsequent news about it being false.

I, for one, would appreciate if something like this gets confirmed before action is taken next time.
