Glad the situation is cleared, your points are obviously valid and hopefully this \"drama\" (as you very well said) can come to an end. However, I think something good can be salvaged out of this. Better that this situation happened now with a mistake than with a true hack. Now some serious thought can perhaps be channeled to answering the following question:

What can be done to more easily verify Tails images and ensure we don't see a repeat of this panic?

You have, of course, already explained the crux of this matter, no-one verified the signature which is (as far as I know) the only way to attain high degree of trust that the software was not maliciously modified. Except the OP who only induced some concern, I would like to believe, because he/she incorrectly assumed the signing key was modified and that was quickly cleared by Tails developers and confirmed by OP.

But now imagine the following situation that could happen since I doubt the average user keep a record of tails key over time and taken from different computers.

OP is a malicious attacker bent on causing FUD and panic amongst the tails community and scaring users into less secure alternatives. OP does exactly the same thing as he/she did in the beginning of the tread. OP does not acknowledge that he/she screwed up verifying the key. Tails devs contradict this point and proclaim the key to be correct. OP, under the guise of different anonymous users in the forum, keeps insisting that the key was modified. Users get scared unless they can use a previous trusted key (perhaps included in a previous tails) to verify the new image. Not to mention that verifying keys is something the average user cannot do (I haven't to this day at least - I used the check it add-on, now md5 reborn harsher).

So, to get to this post point. Does Tails not need better/easier ways to establish trust in the software? Obviously establishing trust in the signing key and then verifying the software is the best solution but truthfully now, what percentage of the user base can successfully establish a trust path to tails devs? Is that even desirable from an anonymity POV? Very few I would wager. We must do a hash check and be at the mercy of attackers bent on attacking tails the easiest way they can, by sowing FUD.

Are solutions as presented bu commenter 14 or 15 possible? (doesn't libert√© linux do something similar in the cables software to find distributed nodes in an anonymous way?) What other solutions are there since establishing trust in tails key and verifying images are not, at least IMHO, practical solutions for most users? Or is the current situation good enough? If acceptable answers to these questions can be found, perhaps next time we could face FUD with more peace of mind.
