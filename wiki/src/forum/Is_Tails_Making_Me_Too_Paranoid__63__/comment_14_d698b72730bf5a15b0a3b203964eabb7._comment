Indeed, thank you OP, a false positive error is much better than the alternative option of tails been hacked and only a few noticing or with a late warning to all. Some compromised tails would exist in that situation.

Newbies to tails may not yet know how to verify signatures, using tails is a learning experience as much as anything else, so once again thank you.

If only there was an automatic way of validating a tails image version 2 from a live tails version 1, or even better, a distributed way of tails users comparing theirs tails amongst themselves (by a whisperback-like process for example), future situations like this could be avoided.
