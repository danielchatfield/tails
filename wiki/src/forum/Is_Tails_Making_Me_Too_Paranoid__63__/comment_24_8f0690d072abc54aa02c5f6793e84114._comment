> Does Tails not need better/easier ways to establish trust in the software?

Perhaps, but there is no free lunch. The easier alternatives all depend on \"trusted third parties\", like certificate authorities in SSL, which is a huge failure. In fact, since Tails' website uses SSL you can already do this: just download the Tails signing key and say that you trust it. Then just hope that our certificate authority, [Gandi SSL](http://wiki.gandi.net/en/ssl), isn't compromised or in league with your enemies.

> Are solutions as presented bu commenter 14 or 15 possible?

No. A running Tails copy cannot be used to verify itself; if it's compromised the verification software could be modified so that it always says that all is OK. The verification software must be trusted and running from a separate, trusted system (e.g. a another, known-good Tails copy).
