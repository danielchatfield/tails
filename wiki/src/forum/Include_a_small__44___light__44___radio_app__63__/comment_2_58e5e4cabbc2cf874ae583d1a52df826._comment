> Hi, just wondering if it was possible to include a small radio app like RadioTray?

I think it would be out of the [[scope of
Tails|contribute/design]], especially since Totem is shipped in
Tails and covers most of the functionality offered by RadioTray.

[RadioTray](http://radiotray.sourceforge.net) allows to *listen to* online radio stations.
