Then perhaps you're experiencing a hardware failure.

Else, that's probably just the filesystem that needs to be checked (and is therefore mounted read-only).

Please try repairing the filesystem with the GNOME Disk Utility's *Check Filesystem* feature.

If this does not work, please [[send us a complete bug report|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] from the system just after you've tried to clone and upgrate.
