Top 7 Ubuntu Desktop Backup Software
[http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/05/backup-ubuntu-desktop](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/05/backup-ubuntu-desktop/)

Backup progs available in stable and that do not at a cursory glance require a server to be running on the remote host (using mostly ssh and tar):

backup-manager
backuppc
flexbackup
obnam
