I commented out the entries for the following:

* at
* m4
* ncurses-term
* time

which resulted in having to configure citadel-server from the Package Manager. I chose the default options, I'm not sure why a server is needed. Does/Could it compromise the security of Tails?

Anyway, after commenting out those lines & installing lsb, I was able to install the driver package and begin printing in less than a minute.
