It could be a conincidence but it seems to work if after entering the bridge addy it takes a while to double check it. During that time the Onion could become red Xed, then the bridge will work but it takes a long time. If clicking OK on the bridge addy too soon, before the red X, it seems to not work.

So it appears to be a conflict there.
