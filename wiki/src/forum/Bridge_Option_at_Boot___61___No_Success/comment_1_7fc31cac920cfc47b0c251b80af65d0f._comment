I don't know why the reply from Tails to the original post of the original thread (with the title \"brudge option at boot....\") just vanished. 

All I did was edit the subject line to correct the obvious spelling error as a service to the OP and community. I was then prompted to login, leading me to think that only registered users could rename threads. (Though why that would be the case when *anyone* could edit the body of any OP is beyond me.) But then I realized that the my renaming had indeed taken effect. But that wasn't all...unfortunately, it seems that...(see first sentence of this post above). 

I only meant to help.
