> Hi, when I tried version 0.14 and now 0.15, still the same problem, I type bridge in boot and then when I enter working bridge, sometimes I write more working bridges, I can't access Internet.

I cannot reproduce this. Please [[report a bug|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] so that we get enough information to help.

> one problem is that torrc file doesn't have correct permissions, tails is trying to create torrc.orig.1 file and no success, it is written torrc is owned by debian. chmod doesn't help me in any case.

Sorry for the useless warning that lead you to try this. This is unrelated, and very unlikely to be the cause of your problem.

> beside it, it demands password, because settings is automatically changed to Use Unix Domain Socket. I tried to change authentication None, but no success.

You should *not* need to mess with authentication settings in order to get Tor + bridges working.
