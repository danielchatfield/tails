Sam Mendes brings Bond surging back with a smart, sexy, riveting action thriller that qualifies as one of the best 007 films to date. What do your think? 
And this is one fo the the funny quote: 
 
Doctor Hall: I'm going to say a word, and I want you to say the first word that comes into your head. For example, if I say, 'day', you say...? 
James Bond: Wasted. 
Doctor Hall: Agent? 
James Bond: Provocateur. 
Doctor Hall: Woman? 
James Bond: Provocatrix. 
Doctor Hall: M? 
M: Bitch. 
 
LOL~ ^ ^
