hello

the last two days i recognized that just after starting tails the first connections only show one hop on the network map.
Some time ago i have had connections showing me 2 hops in stead of three. But this time it is one hop only. Restarting tails using a new ip shows the same result - one hop is used for the first connections. Later at the same day everything is back to normal and every connection uses 3 hops as usually.
Is it some kind of a bug and the other two hops are just not shown or does tor sometimes really only use one hop and what the network map tells me is always correct ?
