I have a problem editing -one- sentence on the page http://tails.boum.org/download/index.fr.html
The sentence is in the first part of the page, here :
http://tails.boum.org/download/index.fr.html#index1h1

"Then, check first the about and warning pages to make sure that Tails is the right tool for you and that you understand well its limitations."

I tried to modify this part with POEdit-and- directly inside the page, and in both case no change appearred in the page. I cleaned my cache and made several other successfull modifications and .. nothing changed in this -only- sentence..
Any ideas? Can you try to modifiy this on your side ?
