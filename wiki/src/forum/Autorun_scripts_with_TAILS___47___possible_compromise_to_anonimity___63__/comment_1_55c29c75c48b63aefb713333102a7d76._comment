Currently, Tails does not pretend to hide you're using Tails. So the
distinguishable browsing pattern is a known issue we would like to
solve on the long run, but not really one we will put that much energy
in fixing quickly to the detriment of other usecases.


Replying to \"Are there any other scripts that run upon connection
other than tails-security-check?\":  I don't remember others.

Replying to \"I tried to delete tails-security-check but there is no
valid permission\": try using `sudo`, it's still available.

There currently is no persistence support in Tails, but this is [[on
the works|todo/persistence]]. Help is welcome.
