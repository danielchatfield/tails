Hi,

OP here, thank you to tails for your response, I am reassured.

In relation to poster 2, I'm not sure exactly how you came to that conclusion, but it might be very perceptive, because ever since I've been using my new dongle, I have to wait until after Tails boots (from USB) before I can plug in, as otherwise Tails won't boot.

Thanks to all.
