I would like to see a response to this from the TAILS devs.

As I understand it, a checksum only verifies that your download did not become corrupted. 

If the checksum of your download matches the checksum of the file on the server, then you know that the two are the same.

But who is to say that the file on the server is not actually a malicious trojan that only /appears/ to be the file you expect? Surely if an attacker gained access to a server and was able to replace a legitimate file with a trojan, that same attacker would have no problem replacing any of the checksum files or mentions with the checksum of his trojan file.

Verifying /signatures/, therefore, is the only way to verify the /authenticity/ of files that are downloaded.
