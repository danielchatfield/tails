You're right: verifying the signature, after [[building some trust in the Tails signing key|doc/trusting_tails_signing_key]] is the only way to check the authenticity of the Tails that you downloaded. Checksum checking is only provided as a cheap alternative for people that don't use OpenPGP.

I think you were confused by the fact that there are two differents signatures when you download with a Torrent:

  - tails-i386-0.10.2.torrent.pgp, which is the signature of the torrent itself, so that you can check the torrent file itself before downloading it
  - tails-i386-0.10.2.iso.pgp, which comes inside the torrent and is a signature of the ISO image that you can use to verify your Tails after downloading it

From what you explained in your first post, everything seems ok.
