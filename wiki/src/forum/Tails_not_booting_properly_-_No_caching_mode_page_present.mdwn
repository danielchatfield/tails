I recently burned the newest version of tails because I thought this might be caused by my old version being outdated or something strange.. but it persists on the new version as well.  Keep in mind I have successfully ran tails on this machine a few weeks ago.

I downloaded the iso and verified it and all was well.  I then burned the iso with imgburn to a dvd and booted from the dvd on startup.  When I get to the tails menu I can choose either live or live (failsafe) and this error occurs in both.

The error is "No caching mode page present.  Assuming drive cache: write through".

The numbers on the left just scroll and count indefinitely.  I believe i was up to around 1000 after letting it just run last night hoping something would change but no luck.  

Any help would be great and if you need furter details from me I will be more than happy to do my best to provide this to you.  Thanks.
