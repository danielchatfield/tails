My guess is that the OP's school has a simple captive portal that allows access for the MAC address of the user's machine after a successful login. So perfectly normal, but of course the privacy implications need to be taken into account - Tor works as expected, but there will be a trail about who was accessing the net from a certain pc at a certain time.
