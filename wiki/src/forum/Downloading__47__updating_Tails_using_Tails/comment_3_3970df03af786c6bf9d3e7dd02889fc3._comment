>Can I do this through Tails (through Tor), or is it too dangerous considering the risk posed by rogue exit nodes?

Yes, it's fine. You will, of course, be using your [trusted](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html) copy of the Tails signing key to authenticate your download. So there's nothing\* a malicious node could do to the .iso which you wouldn't be alerted to.

\* That's assuming the operator of the node doesn't have a workable attack against the SHA1/PKI scheme. None are known. If such an attack was \"doing the rounds\" we'd all soon know about it!
