For a web browser I just click on \"New identity\" in Firefox, and click on Home button to see what check.torproject.org will show. If it is the same IP as I had before I just click the \"New identity\" button again. Sometimes I have to do it several times, but eventually I always manage to get a new IP address. It's not an elegant solution but at least works.
