Today I updated to the latest version of the Tor bundle.  Torbrowser works on Tor, but Thunderbird and Firefox won't when I configure them to 127.0.0.1:9050.  

All I have is the error:

The proxy server is refusing connections.  Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections.

Why is this?  My proxying settings per application haven't changed since I updated.  Vidalia says it is connected (oh, and TorBrowser has packed in as well, now.)
