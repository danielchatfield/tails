Is there somewhere that version .11 can be downloaded?  The closest I was able to get to having .12 running from USB was when I first tried the prochedure to upgrade my USB drive from .11 to .12.  To recreate that scenario I need to get my hands on a copy of .11.  And if I still couldn't make .12 work, at least I could go back to using .11 for awhile.
