Seeing this thread, I just RE-downloaded and RE-imported the TAILS signing key (even though I had already imported the key no longer than four-five months ago.)

When I proceeded to verify the PGP signature for tails-i386-0.14~rc1 , I was told \"Good signature\" BUT then, 

>gpg: Note: This key has expired!

What gives?
