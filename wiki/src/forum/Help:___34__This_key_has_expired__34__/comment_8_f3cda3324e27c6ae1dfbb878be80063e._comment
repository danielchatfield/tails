Now if only the TAILS people would identify themselves, the way the Tor people do. Or at least tell us *why* they don't and tell something about themselves and their motivations.

(And why they:
a) felt it a legitimate use of what they claim is their strained time and resources to GO OUT OF THEIR WAY to disable a USEFUL default in ABP,
b) consider themselves above providing an explanation for a) 

And also, why do they even include ABP *in the first place*, when Tor Browser Bundle does not? Why make the browser fingerprint of the TAILS user differ from that of the TBB user?

Although these are questions that truly demand answers, the TAILS devs will probably have little trouble getting away with continuing to arrogantly and condescendingly ignore such questions, thanks to the cult following they have (quite apparent from this very \"forum\").
