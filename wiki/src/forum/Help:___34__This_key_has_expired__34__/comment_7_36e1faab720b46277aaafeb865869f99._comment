I noticed the same thing, but found the explanation in the outstanding issues page a few days ago so I already fixed my local copy of the public key.

Thanks to the website maintainers for the excellent documentation, which I would have found very useful a few years ago when I was just learning how to use some of these tools!  A few small suggestions: 

Add \"date last modified\" to all the pages (contrast the Tor website, which suffers greatly IMO from having many undated but very outdated pages)

Add finger prints in the web page and also a note warning that if you search in a keyserver to download a public key via torified html, you need to prepend the key identifier (abbreviated fingerprint) with 0x when you search for the key, for example at the mit pgp keyserver.
