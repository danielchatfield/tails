Hello,

I use Tails on a USB stick and would like to limit the number of entry gaurds I use as I'd rather use a solution where I am either 100% or 0% anonymous. Someone intercepting 5% of my activity is just as unappealing as 95%.

My thought process is lowering the number of entry gaurds I use will serve this purpose nicely. If that's not the case please feel free to comment on that as well.

Thanks in advance.
