As I understand it, Monkeysphere and Convergence are two attempts to solve the danger posed by real-world MITM attacks mounted by miscreants who have obtained genuine but improperly issued SSL certificates from a badly run certificate authority (CA).  In one notable incident, a Farsi speaking person going by the moniker \"Ich Sun\" used a rogue certificate to target several high value sites, including Googlemail and the Mozilla add-on site, leading to speculation that a pro-Iranian-government hacker (possibly not state-authorized) was trying to mount MITM middle attacks on Iranian dissidents using Tor to evade the Iranian national firewall in order to maintain email contact with the outside world.

From the encyclopedia which anyone can edit (and which American private prison company GEO recently altered to remove true but deprecatory information about its rampant abuses in a notorious \"youth prison\"):

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_%28SSL%29

> Convergence claims to be an agile, secure, and distributed strategy for replacing SSL Certificate Authorities.[1][2][3] Moxie Marlinspike released it in August 2011 while giving a talk titled \"SSL And The Future Of Authenticity\" on stage at the BlackHat security conference. It is currently a Firefox addon and a server-side notary daemon.  In the talk, Moxie Marlinspike proposes that all of the current problems with the CA system can be reduced to a single missing property, called \"Trust Agility,\" which Convergence is designed to provide.

> ...

> The Monkeysphere Project tries to solve the same problem by using the PGP Web of Trust model to assess the authenticity of https certificates.

Does this resolve your concern?
