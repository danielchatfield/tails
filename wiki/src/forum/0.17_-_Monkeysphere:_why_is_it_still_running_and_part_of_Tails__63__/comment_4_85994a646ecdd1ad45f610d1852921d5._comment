Please don't spread uninformed and undocumented FUD here, and please don't paste links you obviously have neither read nor understood: they're useless but to waste everyone's time.

> why is it still running

msva-perl runs because Monkeysphere was a more or less supported feature of Tails for years, so we don't want to make it too hard for its existing users to go on using it. Given msva-perl is a X session wrapper, it's a pain to install it inside Tails (you have to logout / login after installing). So, existing users of Monkeysphere in Tails just have to configure their software to use it etc.

The OP's question was answered so this thread is now closed.
