I've addressed this already in comment 4.

> How may we safely remove the Monkeysphere project from our systems if we don't want it.

You're free to customize Tails, at your own risks, with your own skills, but please do stop demanding help here to do so, and please stop insisting about it. This is a waste of our time.

I'm very happy, as long as curious people are prepared to read documentation.

@comment6: please have a look at [[contribute/design]].
