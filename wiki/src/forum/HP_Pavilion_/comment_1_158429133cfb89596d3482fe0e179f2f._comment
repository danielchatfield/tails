I get that error message trying to boot Tails from usb on Mac.  

After massive googling, I think Tails devs should try updating the version of live-helper and see if that fixes it.

HP used to be among the most Linux-friendly hardware, except perhaps for Lenovo.  Not sure if it's still the case.   Unfortunately things like UEFI boot and that flash-based cache thing are complicating installing Linux on some of these newer machines.
