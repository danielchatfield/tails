>Sounds perfectly normal though.

How is it 'normal' when an ISP is using a private block, one which is included in Tails' Iptables lan list, that there is no conflict between the usage of the same private block? Shouldn't this block be removed from Iptables 'lan' section?

For example, I ran an nmap scan on a private block which was the same as my local lan, and it was scanning the ISP's private block rather than my own.
