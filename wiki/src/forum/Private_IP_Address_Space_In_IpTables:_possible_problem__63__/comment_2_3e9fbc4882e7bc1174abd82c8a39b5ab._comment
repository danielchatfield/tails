that's correct, but not what i meant.. for an example, when i perform a traceroute on clearnet one of the ips the traceroute passes through is from the isp and its a private address block. im wunnerin if this has any effect when using tails being ass tails iptables assigns three or more private blocks to lan and i dont want it to conflict... you know what i mean?
