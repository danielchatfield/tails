sorry I meant DVD.  I am using a self built computer, gigabyte 880ga-ud3h motherboard, amd 1090T hexacore with 8 gigabytes of ram.  The computer is fairly new.  I have been running windows since build, and had installed ubuntu for a while as well, but since i moved over to a SSD, i never re-installed
