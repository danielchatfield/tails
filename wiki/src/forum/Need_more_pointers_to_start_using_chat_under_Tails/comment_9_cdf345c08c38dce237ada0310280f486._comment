Oh, right, sure, Isle of Man, never thought of that, thanks.

FF/IW in Tails or TBB (pretty much the same).   The problem is not that the documentation didn't load, the problem is that it didn't help me understand some basic questions which arose (like what should I expect to do if I could even get pidgin to work?), didn't help me understand what I needed to do to get it to work.  It seems that unless this a very complicated process, it should be possible to simply explain in linear order what to do in order to find the place to talk to Tails/Tor developers using IRC, and what extras to do in order to use OTC.  For both pidgin and OTC it would be helpful to show a bit of a short mock session to help me recognize that something is or is not working as expected.

@ all:

Not trying to knock pidgin, although clearly I found it unusable without more help which clearly should not be happening.  Another point to bear in mind: it may be that the Tails developers have some reason to believe that pidgin is less buggy than other jabber clients (did I say that right?), in which case it would be well worth learning to use pidgin.
