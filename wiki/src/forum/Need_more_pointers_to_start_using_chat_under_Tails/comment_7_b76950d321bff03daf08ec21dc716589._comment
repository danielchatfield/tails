The poster above is correct.

**Pidgin is pure SHIT for IRC.**

It looks horrible,
it feels horrible,
Tails developers on mailing list,
and others there,
are still trying to figure certain Pidgin shit
out or just don't give a shit IMO.

Please give us a real IRC client, so we don't have to d/l and torify it ourselves.

Once more for the floor:

          #PIDGIN IS PURE SHIT FOR IRC.

               ##FUCK YOU PIDGIN!
