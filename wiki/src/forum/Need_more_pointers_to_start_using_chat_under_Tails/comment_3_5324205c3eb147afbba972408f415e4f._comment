I wrote the OP.  As I said, I read the documentation, which refered me to this:

> For more detailed documentation refer to the official Pidgin user guide

The same site comes up when I use the pidgin help browser, and I had two problems with it:

* I am not familiar with urls ending in .im; does one go there using http protocol?
* the documentation, however my browser accessed it, didn't help me quickly find answers to the basic questions I tried to express

@ \"Tails\", if you read this:

Again, I tried to express some questions I had while struggling to use the available documentation to figure out what I was supposed to do to \"get chat working under Tails\".  My hope is that this is good as gold in writing documentation because it might help suggest some areas where the current documentation at Tails on pidgin/OTR could be improved, to help non-technical users get the most out of using Tails.  If it's no use to you, ignore it.
