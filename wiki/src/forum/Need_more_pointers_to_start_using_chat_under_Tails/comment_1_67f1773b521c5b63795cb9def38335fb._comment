In answer to your two Tails related questions:

>It seemed that the intention might be to help Tails users to quickly and simply set up... an account? and to ... join #tails chatroom and... chat?

That ...is ..approximately! correct

>The pidgin documentation seemed to connect me to what looked like... a url ending in .im, so is that an indication that... some protocol (XMPP?) other than http was being used to connect to some server somewhere? If so, I assume the intention is that this connection is safely torified and even... kept on a different Tor circuit under 0.14 from http traffic?

Yes, Tails' Pidgin ...traffic is ..routed over Tor. What ..you ...appear to be ...attempting at ...some level to ...refer to ...is [stream separation](https://tails.boum.org/todo/separate_Tor_streams/)
