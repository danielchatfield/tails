It's not clear to me whether it's the Tails documentation or the Pidgin documentation he's having difficulty with.

If he's talking about help using Pidgin, then there are a couple of Q&A style pages offering Pidgin related support..

https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin
https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/FAQ

..but if they're no help, there's also a Pidgin user support list:
