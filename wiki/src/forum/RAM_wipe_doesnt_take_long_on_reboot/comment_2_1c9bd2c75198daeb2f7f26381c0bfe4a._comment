When it wipes, is there some form of visual time line (progress meter) confirmation of the wiping process?

I see nothing of the sort, what should I see?

in the fillram file it displays the following:

#!/usr/bin/python

# NB: this program is subject to the system's per-process memory limits.

string = \"\"
while True:
    string = string + \"wipe_didnt_work\n\"
