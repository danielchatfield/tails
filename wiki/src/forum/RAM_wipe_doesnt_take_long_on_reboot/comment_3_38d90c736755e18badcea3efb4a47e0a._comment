> When it wipes, is there some form of visual time line (progress meter) confirmation of the wiping process?

Yes, sdmem prints stars (`*`) to represent progress. However, in the minimal configuration where this runs, your graphics hardware might not be well configured, so you might not see them. I do.

The fact that the system reboots / shutdowns as prompted is the best easy way to have a hint wether the memory was wiped. Of course, you might want to check this more thoroughly by running [[a full-blown test|contribute/release_process/test/erase_memory_on_shutdown]].
