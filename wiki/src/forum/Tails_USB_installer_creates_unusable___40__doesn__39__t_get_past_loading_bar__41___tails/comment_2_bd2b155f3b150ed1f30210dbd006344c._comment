OP here again. I've discovered that the error is \"Unable to enumerate usb device on port X\".

Then by removing splash in boot parameters I was told:
\"This Debian Live image failed to boot\"
\"Unable to find medium containing a live system\"


I reinstalled tails on my usb2.0 from linux with a new iso, and tried again with the same error. 

Should I file a bug report?
