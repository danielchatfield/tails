Current Tails developers are not (and will never be) experts in all fields. No one currently stepped on the development mailing-list to help properly localizing Tails for their language, input methods included.

If you have technical recommandations or even better patches, [[please help|contribute]]! Otherwise, sorry to state the obvious: the situation will never improve without work.
