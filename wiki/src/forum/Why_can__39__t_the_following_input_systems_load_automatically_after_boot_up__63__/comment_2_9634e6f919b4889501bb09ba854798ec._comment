As far as I (other Tails developer than above) know, this is what at least Chinese and Japanese users expect even when using Microsoft Windows and other more common operating systems (don't know about Korean users, but I expect the same for them). The default physical keyboard for them is US QWERTY, with a hotkey (Ctrl+Space in Tails, and if their physical keyboard has a special button for it it probably also works) which switches between QWERTY input and e.g. kana symbol input for Japanese.

If this is incorrect, see previous (Tails) post. :)
