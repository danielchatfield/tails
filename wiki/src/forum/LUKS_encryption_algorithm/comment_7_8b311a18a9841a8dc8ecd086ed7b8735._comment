@5: Did you read it?

       --hash, -h <hash-spec>
              Specifies the passphrase hash for create and loopaesOpen.

              Specifies the hash used in the LUKS key setup scheme and volume key digest for luksFormat.

              The  specified  hash  name  is passed to the compiled-in crypto backend.  Different backends may support
              different hashes.  For luksFormat, the hash algorithm must provide at least 160 bits  of  output,  which
              excludes, e.g., MD5. Do not use a non-crypto hash like \"crc32\" as this breaks security.

              Values compatible with old version of cryptsetup are \"ripemd160\" for create and \"sha1\" for luksFormat.

              Use cryptsetup --help to show the defaults.

       --cipher, -c <cipher-spec>
              Set the cipher specification string.

              cryptsetup  --help  shows  the  compiled-in defaults.  The current default in the distributed sources is
              \"aes-cbc-essiv:sha256\" for both plain dm-crypt and LUKS.

              For XTS mode (a possible future default), use \"aes-xts-plain\"  or  better  \"aes-xts-plain64\"  as  cipher
              specification  and  optionally  set  a key size of 512 bits with the -s option. Key size for XTS mode is
              twice that for other modes for the same security level.

              XTS mode requires kernel 2.6.24 or later and plain64 requires kernel 2.6.33 or later.  More  information
              can be found in the FAQ.


What more \"options\" do you want?


@6: The on-disk format is the same. LUKS2 might drop one day, there are also several Truecrypt FOSSification projects which might come to something useful, but LUKS is LUKS
