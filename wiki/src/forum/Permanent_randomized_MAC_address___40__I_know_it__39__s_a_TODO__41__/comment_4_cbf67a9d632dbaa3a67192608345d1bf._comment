I can change the mac with ifconfig commands, however I cannot connect to any network after doing so.  I use the same commands with the same macchanger in other distros, such as Backtrack 5 and others, and it always works just fine, but not in this distro. I love using Tails, however this is the biggest con with it. I would love to look into the issue further and contribute to fixing it, however I lack the knowledge to do so.
