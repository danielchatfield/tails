@ comment 1:
Thanks for your reply. It's definitely getting harder and harder to stay anonymous and safe.
I'm quite sure though, that most open access points (internet cafés, open nets etc.) allow randomized MAC addresses - macchanger can simulate different fabricates.
Of course there are many cases where the MAC address cannot (and should not) be changed. E.g. an internet café that doesn't allow external computers probably have MAC filtering.
But still, in the end, using your own computer makes it critical to have a changed MAC address at boot up.

@ comment 2:
Macchanger works just fine (the problem is only before you change the MAC address).

I would consider contributing to a general solution but it seems like a lot of thought has gone into this issue... even a bit too much for my taste; I think a simple choice at boot up would suffice.
