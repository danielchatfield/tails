I have been using a LUKS encrypted hdd for some time now.  Latly the drive will mount like usual, then after some time, it will enter "read-only" mode.  In the properties, it says it is in "read and write" mode.  If I dismount then remount, it still is in "read-only" If I shut down TAILS, then re-boot, it will work fine for a while, then re-enter "read-only" mode. Any advice on how to correct this problem would be appreciated.
