I have not tried another torrent yet...was thinking of transmission or utorrent....will try soon and reply...

i prefer \"rtrnt\" for the speed...anyway for my curiosity.......

- do you have a cert that can be imported/provided....? 
- do you recommend a specific torrent client over another? If so, plz name it..

btw, the talis key has  been imported into the key ring!
