Since I did not notice a reply...I figured I'd wait for an update..and lo & behold....0.14 is here.

To the point....and just a FYI if anyone else is encountering this issue....

I downloaded the torrent file and the sig check...and placed both of them in the \"watch\" dir in torrent sw...the download completeled succesfully...

My error related to this post was that I failed to include the \"sig\" file on the 0.13 download attempt..

P.S. Thanks for the continous Updates...
