I had the same problem, I just ejected the usb with the terminal, inserted it again, unmounted it again and when I typed:
\"cat tails-i386-x.xx.x.iso >/dev/disk2 && sync\"
again, the disk was not busy anymore, after a while the process was finished and I just needed to eject it, just need to be patient.
