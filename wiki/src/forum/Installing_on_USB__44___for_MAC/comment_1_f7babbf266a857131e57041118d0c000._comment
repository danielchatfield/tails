I worked this out recently.  Belongs in the docs.  Open a terminal and type:

$ sudo su
(you will be prompted for your password to get root privileges)

# diskutil list
(this will show you the devices connected to your Mac)

Now plug in your usbstick and list devices again so you can be sure which device name it is:
# diskutil list

Say your usbstick is /dev/disk2.  Make sure it is unmounted:
# diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2

Change to the directory where your downloaded the tails iso, for eg:
# cd /Users/yourhome/Downloads

Now write the iso to the usbstick:
# cat tails-i386-x.xx.x.iso >/dev/disk2 && sync

When finished, \"eject\" the device:
#diskutil eject /dev/disk2

You're done.
