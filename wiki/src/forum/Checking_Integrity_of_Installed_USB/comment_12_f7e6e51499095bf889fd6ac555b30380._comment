None of what you've quoted appears *anywhere* in that thread (I searched for several small snippets) and **having read it** previously I couldn't see any suggestion to do as you suggest. Those posts seem relatively well thought out and competent, so I doubt there's an error of this nature which I've missed. Nevertheless, this is a user forum and those posts are *anonymous*. You shouldn't be taking anything on this forum for granted. If you find comments here useful, that's excellent... that's the reason we (well some of us anyway) post them!.. but keep your wits about you.. everyone (even \"***[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Tails&do=goto)***\") can make mistakes, so think before you leap.
