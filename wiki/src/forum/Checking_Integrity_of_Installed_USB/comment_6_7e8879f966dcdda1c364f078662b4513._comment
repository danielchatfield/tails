About the difference between checking a USB stick and a CD:

- When buring on a CD the ISO image is not modified. So the device of the CD is basically a copy of the ISO.

- When installing onto a USB stick using Tails USB installer. A bootloader is installed on the USB stick, a partitions table is created, the ISO is open, and the operating system is copied onto the first partition of the USB stick. As a result the device of the USB stick can not be compared to the original ISO.

About the inconsistencies on the website:

- Thanks for noticing that we forgot to update the gpg command for 0.12.1. That's fixed now.

- The hash `639f0448ed2e05200095e49e86d730b383238ae1ed352e6bad97b9d212a0ff6b` is the right hash for version 0.12.1. I guess the date of last edition corresponds to the last change to the page itself but the hash is inserted as an include of another file (that's some ikiwiki internals). To make it more clear I added the version of the ISO to the sentence before the hash. Is it better now?

About the weird behaviour of the disk utility, I personnally don't know what's going on. Did you install your USB stick using Tails USB installer?
