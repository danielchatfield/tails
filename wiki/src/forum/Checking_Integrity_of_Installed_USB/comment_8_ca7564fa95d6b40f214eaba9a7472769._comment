>When installing onto a USB stick using Tails USB installer.[...] the device of the USB stick can not be compared to the original ISO. 

This may indeed not be possible *when using _TAILS USB_ installer*, but when using the `dd`command [1] to *manually* install an ISO, I believe it should indeed be possible to verify the installed ISO against the downloaded one. The \"trick\", as I learned the hard way, is that you must generate a checksum of the ISO *after* modifying it with the `isohybrid` command (since this does indeed *modify* the ISO and therefore change its hash). 

Then, *as root*, you must generate checksum of the **specific partition** that Palimpsest shows the TAILS installation occupying. So, in the case described in this thread, the exact command to be entered into the terminal would be the following:

	sha256sum /dev/sdc4

(Replace \"sdc4\" with whatever the exact location that \"Disk Utility\" (or a comparable utility such as GParted, etc.)  shows for your specific TAILS installation) 

Then, compare the two hashes to see if they match. 

With this method, I have been verifying my TAILS USB stick after each use, in order to be sure it didn't get altered by a remote attacker while I was running it. (So far, so good.) 

If this method is indeed legitimate, then perhaps it should be included in the TAILS documentation. (Of course, since we're not talking about using persistence here anyway,  simply using a DVD would be much easier but that is not practical for everyone. Actually, what with netbooks, ultra-slim notebooks, etc., and optical media seeming to be on the path to eventually meet the fate that has befallen floppy disks and tape drives...I would think that there are *many* people for whom having to burn and run TAILS from a DVD is less-than convenient.  

[1] Since using the `cat` method described in the documentation never worked for me, I don't know whether the method I describe here would also work for a USB install done with `cat`. I can't really see why it wouldn't but I just don't know enough to say anything one way or the other.
