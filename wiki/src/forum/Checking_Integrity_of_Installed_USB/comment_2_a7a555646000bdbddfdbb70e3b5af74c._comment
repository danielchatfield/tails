There is no way of checking the integrity of a Tails installation from itself. That would be like asking to someone whether she is a liar.

If you are trying to check the integrity of a Tails USB from another trusted Tails, then that might be different. But still, you can't compare the checksum or use the PGP signature on the device of a USB installation like you are doing since the files differ.

What you could do is open the original ISO image from which you installed the USB stick and compare the hashes of the files in both /live folders: the one on the ISO and the one on the USB stick. That might not be 100% guarantee since you won't be able to compare the files of the boot loaders that are different. But still that would be a very good thing to check.
