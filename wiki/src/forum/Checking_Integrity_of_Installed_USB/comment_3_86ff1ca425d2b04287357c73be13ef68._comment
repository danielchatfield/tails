Followup to my original post: 

After much exasperating trial and error[1] , I was finally able to verify the TAILS ISO installed to USB against the PGP signature, and the output was \"Bad signature.\"

Since I am the only one who has had physical access to this USB stick since I created it, I figured that it must have been compromised *while running*. However, since I still I had the ISO image that I had downloaded, I decide to verify *it* again to see what would happen. (Despite the fact that  *I had already verified the signature of the ISO after downloading* and before installing it to USB.)

Sure enough, I got \"Bad signature\" for the downloaded ISO as well.   

Now, I must point-out that this ISO had been copied from the original location that I had downloaded it to. So I suppose that the file could have become corrupted while copying from one disk to another?

Or perhaps the ISO could have somehow become corrupted at some point while idly present on a mounted volume?

NOTES:
[1]Basically, I learned the hard way that I not only had to run the command

	gpg --verify tails-i386-0.12.1.iso.pgp /dev/{my usb stick}

a) from a directory containing the PGP signature file[2],  
but that I also had to:
b) run said command *as root*,
and,
c) run said command as root only after first importing the TAILS signing key **as root** (despite the fact that I had already imported it as regular user!)  

[2]Note on note: I knew this was necessary for verifying the *downloaded* ISO file, however verifying *an already installed/burnt* ISO is completely new territory for me and I was thrown-off by the way the instructions at
https://tails.boum.org/forum/checking_integrity_of_burned_CD/

There, after listing the `gpg --verify` and `sha256sum` commands,  the TAILS dev writing the post went on to say,

>and compare the results with what's expected.
