@comment 2:

I posted comment 3, above, just minutes after your post and before seeing it.

How do you reconcile what you wrote here with the post that I quoted and cited, also signed as \"TAILS\" at 
 
https://tails.boum.org/forum/checking_integrity_of_burned_CD/ 
?

I suspect there may be some misunderstanding between us.

And what about the complete contradiction in what Disk Utility reports for my TAILS USB, as described in my post?

How can a drive with a **total capacity** of 2 GB and a TAILS ISO occupying 799 MB, report \"2.0 GB free\" ?!
