>boot from and verify the ISO

The link you gave doesn't advocate what you seem to be suggesting. Attempting to verifying an ISO from within itself would obviously be pointless. Nothing wrong with verifying *subsequent* ISO downloads from within one you *properly* verified of course but that's not really pertinent here.
