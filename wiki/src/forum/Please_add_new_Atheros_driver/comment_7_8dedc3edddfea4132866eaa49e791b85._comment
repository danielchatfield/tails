Expected this answer but can't say I'm overjoyed.  I will test a binary driver if someone cares to build and post it.  I have a limited range of local buying options.  I did test the Lenovo g580 in-store and the usual hw suspects (like legacy boot support from usb, acpi, usb booting, wifi, sound, screen dimming and touchpad) all worked well on Tails and it has an nvidia gpu (also good for linux).  Lenovo traditionally supports Linux well.

Testing ethernet in a store presents challenges and ethernet has been fine with linux on most laptops for years.  Note the problem here isn't that Linux doesn't support this ethernet hw, it does.  But these changes are not in Tails because Tails devs won't build drivers or a recent kernel.  If this is policy then perhaps Tails could be built from a less elderly distro release than Squeeze.  Q: The reason reason Ubuntu chose not to use Debian stable? A: Updates in Debian stable are too slow to keep pace.  I am probably not the first to suggest that Tails would be better off being built from Ubuntu.  

A head's up to Tails devs that you are probably going to see more of this now since retail laptop hardware has being going through various changes this season (uefi, usb3, other).

May I ask why Tails uses a kernel from Sid - which is even older than Squeeze?
