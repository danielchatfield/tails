Not really true that Nvidia is a pain on Linux, if you're going to buy a GPU for use with Linux it should probably be Nvidia for best performance. But the propietary drivers are closed source so no-one should expect Tails to ship with them.  

The topic is or was either updating the kernel or building recent drivers against the old kernel (if that is possible) to get new Atheros hardware support.  If I wait *long enough*, events upstream will take their course and Tails will eventually get a newer kernel of necessity. So it is a problem that will go away by itself, but when? Six months, one year, two years ..?

It is not at all difficult to compile a kernel from source or to build a driver against prepared sources and headers (but with the right toolchain).  But if the toolchain is too old, that could be a hassle.
