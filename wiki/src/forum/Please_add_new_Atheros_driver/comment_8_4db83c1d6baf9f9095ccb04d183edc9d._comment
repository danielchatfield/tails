In my experience, NVidia hardware is a pain on GNU/Linux,
unless you're prepared to use their proprietary drivers (not shipped in Tails),
and deal with other kinds of pain that come as a consequence.

Sure. It's even [[on our FAQ|contribute/faq]].

This is wrong. Sid is the *unstable* (\"still in development\") version of Debian.
