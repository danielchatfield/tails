Building Tails upon ever-moving foundations would need *much* more work.

This is wrong. You're mixing `testing` and `unstable`.

We want a stable platform to ease our job.
We want a recent kernel for better recent hardware support.

Reference needed, but anyway: general rules often have exceptions :)

Recommendations so that newbies don't shoot themselves in the foot is
one thing; what we, as Tails (and Debian) developers, can thoughtfully
do is something entirely different. In other words, we are aware of
these theoretical problems, and we do backport packages when needed.
But we did not need to do so for the Linux kernel from unstable, that
has been working fine in Tails for ages, so I don't see any
*real* problem that would need addressing :)
