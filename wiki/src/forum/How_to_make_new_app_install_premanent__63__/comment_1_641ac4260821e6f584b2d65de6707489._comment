> I was wondering if there was any way to make something like a new app installation permanent?

* Best that exists already: [[doc/first_steps/persistence]]
* Some day: [[todo/remember_installed_packages/]] (help is welcome)

> Also, every time I run it, I have to re-enter my keyboard local. Is there also a way to make settings changes permanent?

Not yet: [[todo/allow_choosing_language_at_installation_time]].
