I think the permissions (read/write, executable) configurations via a tails boot on a USB is set to reset to where you have to do it manually, that's why the amnesia folder or desktop or whatever. Or it might work on the USB itself even better, anyone try?

Also interesting about the .bin question, I wonder if that'd work. Add those with all the other ones and then add a line to the menu file wherever that may be. Is it that easy to configure your own iso by just isomastering in two files.
