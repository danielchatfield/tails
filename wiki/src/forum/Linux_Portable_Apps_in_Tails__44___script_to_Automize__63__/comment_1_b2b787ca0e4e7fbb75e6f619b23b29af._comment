>As of now if say I want RedNotebook on Tails I have it on a USB drive (only one .bin file). It won't open on the USB, so I have to transfer it to the amnesia folder.

So you're saying that you have it on a USB drive, shouldn't it open with ease since it's standalone and portable? Also,thanks for the portable app references. I have not checked them out yet, but a linux portable app listing is just what I was looking for.

By the way, say you wanted your favourite portable application on tails. Is there any way to save the app so it persists in any form. What if you saved it in one of the directories where tails applications are stored or in /bin, or are we just going to have to wait until the release of 0.11 for any possablity.
