hi

first remark i have is tails greeter do not shows such an improvement over previous version, i suppose this is a work in progress...

second remark video codecs not installed, vlc cannot be installed neither here are apt msg tail:

"vlc-nox (= 1.1.3-1squeeze6)

 vlc-noxvlc-nox
 vlc
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)"


third remark, i do not want to use a fat formated key to install tails, is it as far as you know a way to install on an ext2 key ? (wich i often did via unetbootin, or with a cat command on an hybrid-iso)

thanks for the work !!!

ok
