Hello,

I've just tried Tails 0.7.1 and was quite impressed! Congratulations!

Two things that struck me, though:

First, there didn't seem to be the "lock screen" option that I've seen in other distros. (For when you are in the middle of working on something and need to step away for a short time.) This feature seems *especially* important for someone using Tails. 

Second, why is JavaScript *enabled* by default? Isn't JS a well known risk?
