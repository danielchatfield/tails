Hi I'm trying to determine quick if I should start using Tor. I have been reading and reading all the pages of the tor website to try to understand what it is and whether I can use it but I've worn myself out and still remain confused. I don't feel on the same page. I am really precautious about my privacy right now and nowadays. I fear getting on the internet at certain places fearing that someone or something is recording me and up to something who knows what and that makes me sort of fear to do anything. So I was looking to using Tor but I'm asking what's the catch. 

Right now I'm trying to get my emails off of my old webmail account because I put a lot of stuff on it and I don't use it anymore but I'm afraid that its now stuck on there. I'm afraid that they can track my computer and know stuff about me depending on where I connect and what computer I use so I was going to use Tor but I feel so ignorant of what I fear and how to handle it. Also can someone tell me if there's a way to get my emails off of a webmail account and what I can do to permanently delete the account and everything on it? 

Thanks. I really need some help right now and would really appreciate someone helping me understand what to do.
