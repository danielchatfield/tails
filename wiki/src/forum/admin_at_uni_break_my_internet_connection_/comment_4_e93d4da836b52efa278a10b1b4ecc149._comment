ok, thank you for answers, I will try bridge mode. I will read about NAC. 

If the university owns or is paying for the network connection, is it right to violate their terms and conditions of use?

university is financed from budget and budget from society, so, university is public and should not be misused by birocratic people who want to impose control. so, their terms has nothing with needs of people than with their own misusing their jobs for reading what we type, what we read, etc. for example  it is my business what book I read and there should be no censorship or control. it is the same with internet. it is without sense to speak with admin, he got job because he snitch society, that's how he got job. he is interested for his money and that's all, the same like those who work for dictators.

it s good proposal to get other students but I am sceptic because I am in Germany and they are obedient, if gov tell them to jump from the bridge, they will do it. gov give money and career and consumers have god called money. therefore they support gov whatever gov decide. there are some groups who organize protests, I will contact them.
