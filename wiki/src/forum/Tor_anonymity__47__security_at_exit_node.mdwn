I have recently started using Tor and am still trying to understand the limitations.  One is that Tor does not encrypt traffic between the exit node and final destination.

If the main benefit of Tor is anonymity, and if the number of people seeking anonymity potentially includes a higher percentage of political dissidents, etc., and if an organization wanted to detect and monitor political dissidents, etc., would not that organization be more likely to set up a Tor exit node to monitor Tor traffic than to monitor non-Tor traffic?  If that is true, then would using Tor potentially provide less anonymity and security than using higher traffic volume non-Tor connections?

Hope that makes sense.
