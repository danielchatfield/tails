some old laptops dont support booting from usb-hdd they support usb-zip. however most tools implement usb-hdd. if you get tired of trying to get it to run you can use http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager/download.html 

download the plpbt-5.0.14.zip and burn the ISO file to a CD.

then start from CD and select the usb partition you want to boot - works like a champ ...
