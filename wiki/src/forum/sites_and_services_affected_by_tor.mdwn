Particulary, users who are new to tor should be aware of sites and services that are affected when using tor. Therefore I would like anyone to share their experiences in this thread. There are sites that I and I'm sure others relie on and it's too bad some of these become unusable when your using tor. Although, as tails progressives there are less problems with sites and now youtube works. 

 For me, the service that is really affected is google. Google senses that I'm logging in from all these different ip addresses and takes that as a breach to the account and disables it.

It's really too bad. To me there's really no replacement for google. I don't think tails/tor can do much about the way other sites are going to act in this case, without jeopardizing the incognito part.
