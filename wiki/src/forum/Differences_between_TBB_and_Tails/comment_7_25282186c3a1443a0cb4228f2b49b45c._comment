Oh, I see, this page has some information which bears upon the question I just asked:

https://tails.boum.org/todo/remove_cryptkeeper/

> EncFS volumes cannot be formatted with an arbitrary filesystem. They share the same features and restrictions as the filesystem containing the source directory.

But that is not a security concern, correct?

> Fragmentation of the encrypted volume causes fragmentation of the filesystem containing the source directory.

Does that affect Linux users too?

> Anyone having access to the source directory is able to see how many files are in the encrypted filesystem, what permissions they have, their approximate size, and the last time they were accessed or modified.

Yes, in fact earlier versions didn't obfuscate the names of files in encrypted directory.  I've also noticed that information leaks when you mount an encrypted directory, do something (potentially adding information to unencrypted \"recent changes\" logs kept by gnome desktop environment utilities in standard locations), then unmount the directory.  This seems to me like a more serious kind of information leakage.

I had read an earlier version of the Wikipedia page, by the way, which didn't contain these claims.

So I'd love to hear if you know of a better package.  Or am I missing something about LUKS?  Is it easy to create tested LUKS encrypted volumes?  If so, I'd be grateful if someone would briefly explain or link to a brief explanation.
