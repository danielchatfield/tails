So does Tails.

TBB isn't \"chrooted\", which may give some people a (misguided) idea about it being isolated from the rest of the system. Rather TBB is portable as in that it's self contained and have relatively few external dependencies.

See [[todo/remove adblock?]].

Tails previously shipped an EncFS front-end called `cryptkeeper` but [[it was removed|todo/remove_cryptkeeper]] in Tails 0.12 because EncFS has some pretty serious inherent flaws. LUKS, which is used for Tails' persistence feature, is vastly superior.
