>he recommends installing AdBlock Plus, in the context of a non-torified browser.

I'm afraid I don't see how this is relevant here, as the browser in TAILS is (claimed to be, at least) completely and unchangably \"Tor-ified\". (The \"unsafe browser\" is intended only for logging in to \"captive portals\") 

>Mike Perry (developer of TorButton, now an essential component of modern Tor) has recommended against installing add-ons into TBB, and his arguments should for Tails too, I think. But he does mention that AdBlock Plus and NoScript are probably OK. 

TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) *comes with* NoScript. (So I don't see how Mike Perry could have said NoScript is merely \"probably okay\")

>There seems to be general agreement that NoScript and HTTP now are so valuable that their security/privacy value outweigh possible vulnerabilities from browser fingerprints differing from other Tor users.

I take it that by \"HTTP\", you meant *HTTPS-Everywhere* (the add-on put-out by the EFF that enforces SSL connections for many web sites). This also ships with TBB.

Both NoScript as well as HTTPS-Everywhere are included in both TBB as well as TAILS. I believe, however, that the versions of each used in *TAILS* are not as up-to-date as those used in TBB.
