Here is how  I think the most recent TBB and most recent Tails compare from a practical perspective:

Some TBB plusses:

* TBB uses the FF \"extended release\" which improves browser security beyond the standard IW package in some Linux distributions
* new editions of TBB are much more frequent that new editions of Tails
* TBB uses slightly more recent NoScript
* TBB is basically a chrooted FF with Tor, NoScript, HTTPS Everywhere, Ad Block add-ons, so you can keep two or more copies with different configurations for different uses (such as general web-browsing, Tor-free (!) logging into some security brain-dead must-have web account to which you are already tied)

Some TBB minuses:

* Using TBB can result in a good deal of information left on your hard drive.  (If anyone doesn't believe me I can probably suggest where to look for the awful truth.)  With increasing likelihood, any citizen of any country may be subject to arrest at any time upon suspicion of assisting someone to do possibly do something which is deemed suspicious by someone somewhere, so forensic traces of \"legal but vaguely suspicious activity\" are becoming more of a concern for everyone.  In fact, it now appears that every citizen should expect to have their computer or phone seized or searched by local police at some point, and what the police don't know (because no traces are left) won't cause them to be worried by things they don't understand.
* You need to unpack and carefully reconfigure from scratch each new TBB release (and delete old releases) which can be tiresome.

Some Tails plusses:

* Tails attempts to address the issue of forensic traces
* booting from a read-only live DVD might help prevent at least some remote intrusion attempts
* if you boot from a USB stick, you can create a persistent volume and encrypt it, which can secure against an ordinary thief who picks the USB drive out of your pocket
* comes with the valuable AdBlock Plus add-on

Some Tails minuses:

* if you boot from a live CD, lack of data persistence makes everything much harder (but allowing persistence can compromise one of the most important goals of using Tails, to avoid leaving traces of whistleblowing or something like that)
* booting from a writeable USB stick allows data persistence, but is probably more vulnerable to remote intrusion attempts, to tampering by someone who gains physical access, and there may be a serious danger of a sophisticated forensic analyst being able to read the contents of even an encrypted persistent volume, depending upon circumstances of seizure

I tend to think the best way to use Tails might be to boot from the live DVD but to use a well encrypted USB stick to store data.  I like encfs because 

* it is a Debian package
* as long as you know the passphrase you can access the contents on any computer with a USB port and with encfs installed
* it is probably safe to back up to other media the encrypted directory exactly as stored on your hard drive (although there is some worry about very long term security), which greatly simplies backup
* you can easily delete the hashed passphrase in an emergency situation, rendering the contents permanently unreadable by yourself and possibly unreadable also by adversaries

I'd like to see a future Tails chain encfs with a steganography method suitable for entire directories, or failing that, to chain gpg (or better) with steganography for encrypting and hiding single files.  I'd like to see ECC, Twofish, and other more modern methods in addition to the standbys: AES, Cast.  It is interesting that the designers of a recent state-sponsored malware chose Twofish instead of AES or Cast.
