> Tails previously shipped an EncFS front-end called cryptkeeper but it was removed in Tails 0.12 because EncFS has some pretty serious inherent flaws. LUKS, which is used for Tails' persistence feature, is vastly superior.

Thanks; I didn't know that.  Could you elaborate a bit or provide a link to a post or paper explaining the flaws in encfs?

Do you have any recommendations for a package to use in order to make encrypted directories on a LUKS encrypted volume?
