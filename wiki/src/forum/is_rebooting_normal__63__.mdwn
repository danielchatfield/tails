Hello,
i have  question:
is  rebooting after browsercrash(iceweasel-Tails0.13~rc1. testing(-: )
normal?Cause of to little memory(512mb RAM)?
USBstick-LED blinks before browsercrash.
Rebooting means black screen,mousepointer rotates and then the login(choose with or without rootpassword->Forward)-only tried with rootpassword.

Files downloaded  before crash still here.
Filemanagersettings,Browsersettings,..... still here.
Custom Keyboardsettings(System->Preferences) are reseted on default.

Have had these(?) crashform on Tails 0.12.1 with iceweasel before:

-Browser+Tails is mostly unresponsive->endless unstoppable USBstickLED activity->only PC-hardreset helps

-after some time i can quiet the browser and Tails is still alive

-Have only one crash on iceweasel(TAILS 0.12.1)
with an instant login screen like now on testeng Tails 0.13~rc1.
