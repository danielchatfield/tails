(Sorry if this post is redundant. Please direct me to other threads where appropriate.)

To add to the extreme security procedure, wouldn't it be a neat idea to integrate Heidi Eraser freeware and custom-programmed RAM quick wipe option (automated every 15 minute or manual click) within Tails OS operating on booted DVD-R or thumb drive? 

This for extra-measure security to prevent retrieval even upon forced shutdown by power switch, pulled power cord, battery removal or holding power on/off button.

Would Tails be suitable to manage the on-site or remote server owned by Tails user or granted administrative access to manage the server? In conjunction with Virtual Machine and encryption systems?

Will there be the replacement for TrueCrypt in current development, with GPG encryption? 

Norton software maker owns PGP and that made me uneasy.
