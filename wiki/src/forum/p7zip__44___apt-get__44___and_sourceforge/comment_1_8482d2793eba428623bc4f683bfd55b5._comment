- apt-get network communication goes through Tor when using T(A)ILS
- p7zip is not bundled in T(A)ILS, and is thus not a supported feature. This seems like a Debian Lenny or upstream bug more than a T(A)ILS bug.

General note: please create a forum thread per topic next time, it will make it easier to follow the discussion.
