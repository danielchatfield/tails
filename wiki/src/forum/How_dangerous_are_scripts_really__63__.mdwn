As many websites require scripts to be allowed, I don't know how dangerous it is to allow them for using some websites fully. Can scripts unmask the real IP? Which are really dangerous and which solutions are available to protect anonymity.

For example: what does google-analytics.com do exactly? When NoScript is enabled, it blocks almost everything. So have to allow it manually, but how dangerous is that?
