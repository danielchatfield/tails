Is it possible yet to securely wipe files from a USB flashdisk or microSD?

Because in the docs section about deleting files securely there is a warning that files can not be wiped from usb flashdisks. So it's safer to save files temporarily on a hard disk and then wipe it instead of working with usb or microSD?
