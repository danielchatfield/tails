To change my router's mac address (sppof it), I have to login into it from my browser as admin at http://192.168.1.1 - so, yes it is possible, but your router has to have the capability to do that in the first place.

Consult your router's documentation to see if it has this capability to spoof it's mac address, i.e. can only be done if computer is connected to router.
