The future for tails does not seem very bright, if doesnt gearup from its current incremental pace of 0.01

It is heavily dependant on Tor (actually in a broad sense its just a linux based os which reinforces use of tor network for all internet connectivity)
Moreover, Having a anti-installation oriented design, it does not appeal to general user.

Using vidalia on a stable major distribution(fedora,ubuntu,Arch,..), completely outweighs running Tails(livecd/usb/vm), in almost all aspects(flexibility, control, security via regular updates, reliability..).

I think Tails should look into bringing out steps on 'How to Tailify your Linux-based OS'. That would be best thing for USER, until Tails becomes a major distribution (with all sorts of things.. installation, repo updates, etc)
