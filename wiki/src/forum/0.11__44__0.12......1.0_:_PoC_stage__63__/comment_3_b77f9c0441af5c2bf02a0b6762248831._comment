>Using vidalia on a stable major distribution(fedora,ubuntu,Arch,..), completely outweighs running Tails(livecd/usb/vm), in almost all aspects

Except for being _\"amnesic\"_...
Remember that TAILS is an acronym for \"The *Amnesic*\" Incognito Live System\"...
 
The distros you list are only _amnesic_ when run *live* and while it is true that _any_ live environment will be amnesic by definition (by default; barring persistence), it is also true that: 
a) Few live environments are well-suited to for running and properly using Tor 
and,
b) Few, if any distros release updated live ISOs as often as TAILS does

And even in those case where \"amnesia\" is not required, consider the following.

While the Tor Browser Bundle may be easy for almost anyone to use, it only \"torifies\" what is done within it; TBB is of no help for outside apps, such as IM, IRC or email clients, etc. And configuring Tor for such apps is not that simple even in an *installed* environment, much less in a *live* one.
