If by \"PoC\" you mean \"Proof of Concept\", I think Tails is far from being one. The landscape of usable [[Privacy Enhanced Live Distribution|contribute/design]] has currently narrowed to two distributions: Libert√© Linux and Tails. It looks like all other projects did not sustain the amount of work that is need to maintain such distributions.

What is left to be done before 1.0 can be seen in the [[roadmap|contribute/roadmap]]. The 1.0 mnemonic was thought as \"being feature par with Incognito\". Yes, it takes that long, but Tails already gained several features that Incognito did not have.
