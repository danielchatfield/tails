> You may be thinking of i2p where this is indeed a problem with insecure configurations (.i2p resources are going through i2p but clearnet resources are fetched directly instead through tor or i2p exit proxy)

FYI this is not an issue in Tails. Any clearnet resources on a page fetched through .i2p will be fetched through Tor. Well, it's still an issue since it identifies you as an I2P user which also run Tor with a setup that can handle both at the same time, but you certainly won't leak your IP address.
