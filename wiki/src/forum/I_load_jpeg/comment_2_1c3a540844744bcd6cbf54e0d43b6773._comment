No, your IP is safe in this case. All website resources are fetched over Tor and we haven't had a remote code execution vuln in a jpeg parser or renderer in a long time. 

You may be thinking of i2p where this is indeed a problem with insecure configurations (.i2p resources are going through i2p but clearnet resources are fetched directly instead through tor or i2p exit proxy)
