So you're saying only use tor for sending email if your email doesn't have anything to do with you? Is tor only for like changing your IP address and that's it and curing all privacy concerns or whatever on that? What else is there to fear then if anything? 

And I guess the most private way is on public networks wouldn't it since there is a such thing as isp's and you'd have to trust whoever is behind you're internet and whatever they can see, right? I guess can they detect or see when you're using tor maybe (have no knowledge about how isp's work and feel ignorant to this stuff but just thinking)? Also, just wondering are IP addresses dependent on isp or device?

Another few questions I'm wondering is if I encrypt an email let's say than is that true privacy then or still not private because it seems commonplace because I see options to encrypt from using Thunderbird and stuff?

Also I'm just wondering how does orbit work if you have to pay for your mobile internet (again feel ignorant how all this stuff works)? I guess can your phone service provider tell I guess then? Can't they still get your location and stuff too by connecting to the mobile internet or by just having your phone on I guess?



P.S.  I have a lot of questions and things about the internet and stuff like this just fearing to use them because it feels unknown to me and I'm afraid to do anything and feel stuck. Is there a place I can go to get help with my questions and concerns too maybe?
