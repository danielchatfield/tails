Security is not \"simple\" and especially there is no simple \"solution\" to all your worries. Security is a way of thinking, of seeing things, analyzing. It's nothing you can buy and plug in or download, set and forget.

For now I advice: If you do anything that can get your really into trouble (doesn't have to be illegal, can be upsetting the wrong people, ratting out on somebody who could mean you harm or something that could cost you reputation or your job) stop right now! Read more, lurk more till you get an understanding for how things work on the internet. It's not just technology, it's also a social, people skills, getting a sense for what's a scam, what you can reveal about yourself...

When it comes to email, think of it as using your mobile on a train. People around you can hear anything you say, but they probably are occupied with their own lives. Unless you say something out of the norm. Then expect them to closely start listening and you'll probably be reported and get into trouble.

In any case: if you use your real name or a nick name that can be connected to your real name as your email address don't use Tor. There is no point in doing so, it only makes you a potential target by malicious exit nodes. If you don't want to \"hear\" the world what you say/write you need to use encryption, for email the best option is http://gnupg.org/

If you want to anonymously email someone and don't care about anyone else reading the email: Download Tails on your own network, verify the download, start Tails, sign up for a new webmail account (e.g. hotmail works fine with tor), write the email, do not take notes like your account name and password anywhere, power off Tails. Unless you expect someone resourceful and powerful like the NSA to be \"personally\" interested in your identity Tor is anonymous enough and you don't need to use a public network.
