>I've also been wondering if it matters what computer I get on as well.

If you do more than lolcats and checking the weather you should really only use a computer you solely control, own and can reasonably trust to be spyware-free.

Use strong passwords, use full disc encryption, install all security updates, only install reputable software, install security software, secure your browser configs (Chrome/Chromium is good non-anonymous use, for Tor only use the TBB or Tails). Using only open source for anonymous mode is recommended.

Don't overlook physical security (keyloggers, bugs, hidden camera, TEMPEST).
