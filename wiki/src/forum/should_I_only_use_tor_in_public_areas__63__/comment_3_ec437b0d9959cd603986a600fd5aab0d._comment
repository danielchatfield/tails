Ok I guess I'm sort of comprehending what you're saying but all this stuff is just way over my head and I'm not getting it. I checked the stuff on wikipedia but I didn't understand it at all and seems like no help to me. I still don't know if tails is secure and how and when I should use it. I'm all the time worried if I do stuff on my computer if my computer has an id when I do stuff like on the internet and if that is something to watch out for or like what internet connection to get on. It just seems like there's something to worry about and that the internet is now set up to use us maybe. I don't know.

I'm just so ignorant and yet so worried about this stuff and its just killing me so I was thinking maybe tor is the solution to my worries but I don't know. Just have a phobia I guess about this stuff. I just want things to be simple and free but it seems so complex to get there and I'm weary of worrying now after so long. I just want to send an email to someone but figured I should do it using tor on an open network not my own I guess or like a public network but I don't know all the threats or even how the internet works and feel like a newb in a way. Can you help me now? Oh yeah I live in USA if that helps I guess.
