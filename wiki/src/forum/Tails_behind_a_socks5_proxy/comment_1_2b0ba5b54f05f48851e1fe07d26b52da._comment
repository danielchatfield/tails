Known issue, already reported on this forum. First hit when searching this website for `ClientTransportPlugin` is: [[todo/non-obfsproxy proxy]].

> If I manually disable ClientTransportPlugin obfs2 exec /usr/bin/obsfproxy in /etc/tor/torrc, then I can connect fine. But is this safe?

It is safe.

> And what if I want to use Tor bridges later?

Removing this line won't prevent you from using regular bridges. It will prevent you from using obfuscated bridges.
