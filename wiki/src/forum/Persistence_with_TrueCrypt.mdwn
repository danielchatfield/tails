Is there an easy way for a relatively non-techie to add persistence with TrueCrypt to TAILS.  I love the distro ... I love the anonymity ... it works well on my netbook - I just hate losing all my settings each time I shut down.  Claws Mail is useless without some sort of 'save' function.  

Ideally I would like to see have TrueCrypt run from the same USB and then use a TrueCrypt container to store TAILS settings, email and some files.  

Is this possible?  How difficult would it be?  Can you point me in a direction?

Thanks!
