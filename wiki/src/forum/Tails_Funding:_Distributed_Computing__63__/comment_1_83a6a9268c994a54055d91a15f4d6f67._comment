I'm not sure the entire potential userbase is all that great... and given the somewhat secretive (a polite way of saying paranoid!) tendencies of Tails users, I imagine the takeup (and hence returns) might be a bit disappointing. Of course, if you think it's worth the effort I doubt anyone would stand in your way.
