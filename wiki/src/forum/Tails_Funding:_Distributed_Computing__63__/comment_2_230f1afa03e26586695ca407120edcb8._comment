Interesting that you suggest that. I thought of much the same a while ago. That if tails had a bitcoin miner, I could contribute money to tails development while otherwise not as i am unemployed.

There were some discussions about this on the forum though and apparently the developers don't think bitcoin is a priority. There is talk of including a client but not a miner (although they were considering including something on the documentation for those who need truly anonymous bitcoins).

I doubt that many have hardware capable of doing mining (I don't) but if in the future I had I would donate some of the profits to tails (and to the reprap project...go FOSH!)
