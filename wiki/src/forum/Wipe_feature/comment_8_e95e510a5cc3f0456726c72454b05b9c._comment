It would probably be useful to many (most? all?) Tor/Tails users to read good surveys of cryptanalysis, metadata, and forensic analysis, written for persons concerned about personal privacy.  This background is necessary to appreciate how we (and others!) can be seriously harmed if we fail to use whole-disk encryption, or when we do but when the pseudorandom number generator underlying our cryptosystem produces bit streams which fail to behave like a \"truly random\" bit stream.  Not very long, ago, there was a very serious example of this in the Debian world.  (Tails is based on Debian Stable, but that particular flaw, which affected SSL as provided by Debian, but not GPG file encryption or LUKS disk encryption, has long since been fixed.)

Modern ciphers are very good, when they are good, but modern disks also contain huge amounts of data, offering many opportunities for cryptanalytic attacks.  According to James Bamford, author of several books on our principal adversary, a few years ago the NSA made a significant breakthrough in practical cryptanalysis.  On the other hand, it has been reported that encrypted data found on a computer used by Ramzi Youssef has never been successfully cryptanalyzed (despite, presumably, the best efforts of US government cryptanalysts).  And whatever worked for him can work for ordinary citizens who aren't doing \"something wrong\" but who simply want to reserve some privacy for some parts of their lives.

For anyone who doesn't want to wait for purpose-written documentation, the Wikipedia can be a good place to start reading about these topics.


The US intelligence community is the most capable and lethal which has ever existed, and it keeps getting worse and worse.  And it targets absolutely everyone, in ways which already go far beyond anything envisioned by George Orwell:

If you read these three samples of articles documenting some of the things the US IC is up to these days, you'll quickly see that a tool like Tails can be at best only part of the solution to the problem of how good citizens can resist activities which are so (if you will pardon a phrase) anti-American.

But all governments are doing all of these things to the extent that they can, and it appears that as the global depression deepens and social unrest increases, all governments are principally targeting their own people.  The US government is simply showing the way (and leading the marketing charge in the lucrative sale of country-level surveillance systems to other nations).  But companies and other organizations worldwide are joining the \"fun\":
