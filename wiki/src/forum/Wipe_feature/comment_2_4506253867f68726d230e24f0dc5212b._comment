Does the wipe utility built-into TAILS still utilize the 35-pass algorithim based on Peter Gutmann's (in)famous 1996 paper? 

If so, please consider:

1.) Gutmann himself wrote an epilogue to that paper in which he says that 35 passes should never be necessary for modern drives 


2.) 
'The Urban Legend of Multipass Hard Disk Overwrite'
http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/16130-The-Urban-Legend-of-Multipass-Hard-Disk-Overwrite.html

>Multipass disk overwrite and  the “DoD 5220-22-M standard 3-pass wipe”
are, at best, urban legends. At worst, they are a waste of time and
electricity.

>a single pass overwrite with any arbitrary value (randomly
chosen or not) is sufficient to render the original HDD data effectively
irretrievable.
