By Pocket WiFi, do you mean something like this?

Some posters have previously expressed concerns that problems like hard-coded default root accounts on home wired and WiFi routers could pose a serious problem even when using Tails.  The Tails developers stated a contrary belief, and I certainly hope they are correct, but no reasons were provided, and they are not infallible, so they (or other posters) might be wrong.

Be this as it may, there appears to be broad agreement among security researchers that security in consumer WiFi devices is in general *terrible*.  Despite all the infuriating problems with poorly designed consumer wired routers, I tend to think you are much better off using the best consumer wired router you can find.  But I'd be happy to hear opinions from other Tails users.
