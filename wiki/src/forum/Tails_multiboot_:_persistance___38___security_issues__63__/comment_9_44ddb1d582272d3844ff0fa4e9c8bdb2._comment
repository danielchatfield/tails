Persistent data is automatically recognized in Tails, and needs manual access on the other OS. I use stock ISOs for this config.

I came to another idea, which should only require 1 USB stick. I'm going to test it soon. Basic steps are:

* install Tails with its USB installer. This creates a fat32 partition with some files.
* enlarge such partition as needed, and copy files from another distro's ISO (kernel/initrd/filesystem.squashfs...)
* configure Tails' syslinux to also boot this other OS
* in the remaining space, create Tails persistent partition with the \"official\" method

Never stop experiments ;-)
