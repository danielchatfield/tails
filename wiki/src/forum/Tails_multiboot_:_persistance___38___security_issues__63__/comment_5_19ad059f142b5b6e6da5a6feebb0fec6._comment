I suggest the following layout for the multiboot stick:

* grub2 bootloader in the MBR
* a big partition (fat32 or ntfs), containing a LinuxMint ISO and a Tails ISO
* a small partition (ext3) with the second-stage grub2 files

Grub2 will be configured to loopback-mount and run the two ISOs.
It is important for the big partition to be created first, because Windows can only read the first partition from USB stick.
This setup has the following advantages:

* when plugged into a running PC, it behaves like a standard USB stick (provides some plausible deniability)
* you don't need to create an ISO with 2 OSes
* to upgrade, you just overwrite one of the two ISOs with the newer one (no backups needed)

To boot Tails, I use the following block in the grub2 config file:

    menuentry \"Tails 0.16\" --class gnu-linux --class os {
    	loopback loop (hd0,msdos1)/tails-i386-0.16.iso
    	linux (loop)/live/vmlinuz isofrom=/dev/sdb1/tails-i386-0.16.iso boot=live config live-media=removable nopersistent noprompt block.events_dfl_poll_msecs=1000 nox11autologin
    	initrd (loop)/live/initrd.img
    }

LinuxMint can be started this way:

    menuentry \"Linux Mint 14 KDE ISO\" {
    	loopback loop (hd0,msdos1)/linuxmint-14-kde-dvd-64bit.iso
    	linux (loop)/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper iso-scan/filename=/linuxmint-14-kde-dvd-64bit.iso noeject noprompt splash --
    	initrd (loop)/casper/initrd.lz
    }
