> I would simply like to know : wether Grub is the best bootloader for this task as it seems to prevent Tail's \"wipe memory\" features and specifically for which reasons persistance gets disabled because of it? Is it only the Tails Wizard that's bothered or is it a more fundamental limitation because of partioning issues?

Some parts of Tails need to find out information about the
system, e.g. the device it was booted from. For the sake of code
robustness, user support simplicity, and release-time test suite
length, only the supported installation methods are handled by
these parts of Tails. E.g. we simply don't have time to multiply
by two or four or whatnot the number of tests we have to run in
these areas at release time.

So you're obviously free to install Tails any way you want, but
then the result won't really be Tails: it will be a custom system
of yours, and you should not report bugs or expect support
about it.

Sorry.
