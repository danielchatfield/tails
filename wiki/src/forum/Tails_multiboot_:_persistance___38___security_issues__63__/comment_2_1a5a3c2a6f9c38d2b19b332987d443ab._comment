Hi dev(s)

thanks for replying wrt to Grub, I am aware of the extra complications this implies for you and understand it won't be a supported Tails install. I will find or develop my own solution to this dual boot need of mine.  Concerning the persistance issue, again does it have to do with Tails-specific choices or with the app's design limitations?

thanks for your time.
