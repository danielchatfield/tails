\#5 here, again

I did it ;-)

I unpacked a Linux Mint ISO and copied the \"casper\" folder into a Tails install. Then I added this block to both /syslinux/live686.cfg and /syslinux/live486.cfg in the Tails USB stick:

    label linuxmint
    	menu label Linux Mint
    	kernel /casper/vmlinuz
    	append boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.lz live-media=/dev/disk/by-label/Tails quiet splash --

This should be OK for any casper-based live ISO. For live-based ones, you will have to copy the \"live\" folder instead, rename it to something else* (let's say live2) and add live-media-path=/live2 (or whatever name you used) to the kernel command line. This last point is untested but should work fine.

\* this is because there is already a \"live\" folder, which is Tails
