Pointless argument. 

At least with Truecrypt, if they find your containers you can give them the decoy passwords to get into your fake storage. There's no way to prove there is another hidden container inside that unlocks with a separate password that contains all your revolutionary plans and contacts. 

If you use LUKS/ect then you have no such options. If I'm an Iranian, and the choice is open the fake container and show the Basij my mild yet illegal porn, take the sentence and live another day OR handing over my LUKS password with hundreds of dissident contacts in it (guaranteeing execution for me and everybody on the list) I'm gonna go for option #1

Truecrypt is simply the best option. Read all the stolen FBI leaked emails from Antisec on Nov 18 where they talk back and forth about being unable to break TC encryption or read any data using their useless EnCase forensic software
