while I am a great fan of truecrypt, tc files are now identifiable and searchable.

http://www.ghacks.net/2011/04/11/tchunt-search-for-truecrypt-volumes/

that said, truecrypt has many features I like, like diffrent and/or multiple encryption techniques, benchmarking, hidden containers within containers(deniability which hasn't been cracked), and of course its portable. It also supports keyfiles and pkcs #11 for authentication.

Its also portable, it can encrypt an entire partition, or just an easy to distribute container, which of course runs mac-linux-windows compatibility.

LUKS is easier to use though with gnome-disk-tool, but it lacks the many features of truecrypt.

I aruge that TAILS continue to provide both and let the user decide.
