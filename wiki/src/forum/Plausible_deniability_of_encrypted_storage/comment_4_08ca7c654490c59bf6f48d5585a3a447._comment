If your adversary wants to beat you, then they'll do it. No guarantee once they get what they want from you anyway they'll spare you. Even with LUKS, whatever other encryption.

Then you also have TOR and setups to use everything for it. The entire tails CD is reasonable suspicion to a paranoid or fascist government or adversary. 

Again if they want to torture you, they're gonna do it no matter what they tell you.

You can discount truecrypt for working better.

Besides, its container files make it really portable, i.e. can be uploaded and shared on internets, copied and pasted like any other file.

Oh, and your truecrypt container can be used on just about any computer in existence with truecrypt because its been ported so widely, with official ports representing 99.9% of desktop usage.

but really....if your that scared, just use unencrypted FAT patitions. Don't use TOR either. quickly delete TAILS out of your browser history.
