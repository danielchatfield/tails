>Problem 1: If a TC volume indeed is indistinguishable from random junk, then any file that looks like random junk may be considered as TC volumes by your adversaries, even those that in fact are not TC volumes or encrypted data.

If a TC volume indeed is indistinguishable from random junk expect your enemies to shoot you in the head.

>Problem 2: Since TC supports hidden volumes, even if you disclose all your keys and passphrases to your adversaries they may insist that you have hidden volumes when you in fact don't.

Even if you disclose all your keys, expect your enemy to shoot you in the head.

>That said, I'd love to have the above proven wrong as I see plausibly definable ecnryption as a very desirable feature.

Because your such a little know it all twit, your users get shot in the head. 

Seriously grow the fuck up, you can either give your users a chance to play along, play dumb and hope for the best, or you can force them to resist, give in, and be killed. I know what the real problem is, you just dont want to do the work.
