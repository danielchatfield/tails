Btw, off topic for those interested, the conflict that used to exist between the loop-AES-patched mount utility and libfuse has been fixed.  That was the main reason loop-AES was dropped on some mainstream distros since mount with Fuse support is required for other stuff like OTFE and Truecrypt. That problem no longer exists and loop-AES support - basically a patched loop.ko (or kernel) plus patched mount utils -  doesn't break those other encryption schemes anymore. Admittedly, it's for commandline people but it shouldn't break other things now.
