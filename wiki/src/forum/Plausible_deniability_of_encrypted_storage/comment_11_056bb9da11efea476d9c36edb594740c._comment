I agree with the OP. TrueCrypt's allowing hiding a second OS without any evidence that it's there is a big deal. OTFE/LUKS apparently allows for this kind of functionality as well, but it needs a GUI since encryption in general is complicated for an average user and the more complicated operations involving creating and using an OS inside a hidden volume would confuse many even further.
  So, yes, please keep TC at least for as long as an adequate alternative is not available.
 Btw, has anybody successfully transplanted their Tails into a hidden partition/volume as TC supposed to do?
