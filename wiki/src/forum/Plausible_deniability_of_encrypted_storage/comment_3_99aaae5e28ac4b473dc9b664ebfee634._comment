The UK has a key disclosure law, but they still need to prove <b>beyond reasonable doubt</b> that you have the key before they can convict and send you to jail. If you use a hidden volume or occasionally wipe partitions by overwriting with pseudo-random data then you have easily created enough doubt to avoid prosecution (assuming you didn't screw up in other ways and that is all they have).

TrueCrypt in portable mode is an option I suppose, but not ideal because you need to store the portable version somewhere or download it every time. If you want to store it then you need an unencrypted partition somewhere.
