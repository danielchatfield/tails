While possible, it would do your users a disfavour. For [[various reasons|support/truecrypt]] TrueCrypt will be removed from Tails in a not so distant future. There are alternatives in Tails already, e.g. Applications -> System tools -> Cryptkeeper (encrypted folders) and Applications -> System tools -> Disk utility (encrypted partitions on e.g. USB drives).
