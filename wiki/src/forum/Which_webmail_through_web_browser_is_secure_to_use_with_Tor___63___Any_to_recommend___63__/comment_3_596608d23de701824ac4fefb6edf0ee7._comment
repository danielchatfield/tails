lavabit worked last days for me with tor, but before several months, it was not possible. 

riseup is for activists, if you are not one of them, they will not open account for you. you must have recommendations from some activist. you can try and see. it is the same with boum.org and many others. 

if you want anonymity and without recomendations, you can use tormail.org (http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/), http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/roundcube is more secure than http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/squirrelmail because of some scripts.  and you can use messaging system like http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion (find there TorPM, private message system). you can write all messages in email or PM in encrypted way, so, use gpg encryption.
