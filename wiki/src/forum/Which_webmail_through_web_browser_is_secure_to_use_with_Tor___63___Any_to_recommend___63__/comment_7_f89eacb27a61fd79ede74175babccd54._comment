>you can use tormail.org (http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/), http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/roundcube is more secure than http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/squirrelmail because of some scripts. and you can use messaging system like http://4eiruntyxxbgfv7o.onion (find there TorPM, private message system).

First, other than the issue you point-out regarding \"some scripts\" for the squirelmail .onion, what is the actual difference between the first three .onions that you list?

The second two appear to be redundant interfaces for the first, i.e., Tor Mail logins. What, exactly, would the point be of such redundancy/mirroring? Insurance in case of an outage?

Second, and more importantly, note the disclaimer at the top of the page at tormail.org :

\"This product is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.\"

And given that there is indication whatsoever of who *is* behind Tor Mail, or why anyone should trust them... Why *should* anyone trust them?
