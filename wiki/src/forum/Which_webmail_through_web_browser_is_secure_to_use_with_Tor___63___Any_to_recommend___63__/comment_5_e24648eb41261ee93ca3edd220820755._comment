Nobody should be using hushmail anymore. Don't you guy's read the news?
tormail works find with clawsmail as long as you don't have too many messages then it seems to hang as it tries to decrypt them (I found installing to USB fixed this problem, I only had it when using a live CD)

Tormail changed from Tormail.net to Tormail.org recently
