I don't disagree with the proposition that the developer's time is better spent elsewhere, but I don't think this means that the rest of us cannot carry on a useful discussion.

A useful but incomplete compendium of privacy research papers is

Note that some of these specifically discuss correlation attacks on hidden services.

(Aaron Swartz wanted to ensure that all such papers are available to everyone, and I believe this would clearly be in the best interests of all citizens.)

I believe that those of us with more background can help those with less to understand the gist of the most relevant papers.
