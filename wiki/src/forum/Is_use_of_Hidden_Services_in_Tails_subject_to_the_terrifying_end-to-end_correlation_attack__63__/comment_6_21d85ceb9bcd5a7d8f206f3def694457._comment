if you can see this website >>> then you are accessing another person hidden service if not then you are NOT using tors or tails >> http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/

addition to the specific onion address above you can find out more about hidden services and the end to end correlation risks.. you have to find it yourself..

tor documentation (NOT tails) is also here >> https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation

goodluck and please let Tails team get on with their productive work rather than them helping people out who seemly cannot be bothered to learn to use search engine or spend a bit of their own time reading up on basic stuff. rtfm.
