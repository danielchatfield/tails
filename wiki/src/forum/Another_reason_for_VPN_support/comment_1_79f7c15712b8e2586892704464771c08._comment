So you're talking about booting into a VPN? 

Or using a VPN from within tails? 

I'm trying to install my VPN client into my Persistent folder, not so much cause I care that I care that my ISP sees I'm using tails, but because the wireless network at my school wants a Certificate Authority and I was worried some data would go out into the wild naked as it were. 
So I thought I make a through the TOR relay... I'm not sure if it's a good idea - slow probably...  or I guess I would need a tunnel at each hop?  Or at least at the other end. 
Hmmm..
Have I got that right?  Anyway thanks for letting me think that out.
