I haven't been able to stay connected to a vpn through tor. It will succeed, then disconnect me not that long after. Probably a routing problem as everything should go to tun0 exept tor traffic that should go directly to the internets..

Anyone here know why it's not possible to change the socks proxy port in tor browser inside tails, hence not possible to use an ssh socks proxy as a fixed exit node?

Has it been designed on purpose? How does that work? I mean why even if it's changed the traffic goes through tor?

Can't find anything about that in the docs... That would be the perfect/easieast solution for OP...
