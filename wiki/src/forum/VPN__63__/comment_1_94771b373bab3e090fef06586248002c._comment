It's not possible to use a vpn with tails there are many reasons but the main one from my opinion is that it's pretty hard to connect to a vpn through tor.

It would theoretically be possible to use an ssh socks proxy (hence hiding the fact that you are using tor) and would be really cheap to get anonymously a small VPS/shell account somewhere.

BUT it appears that it's currently impossible to change the socks proxy port in the torbutton, and it's really a strange behaviour as of course it's possible to change that setting with torbutton. Hope it will be fixed soon.

To get an anonymous VPN or VPS/shell account, you'd have to find some untraceable electronic money (prepaid debit card, well laundered bitcoins, etc) and buy from tor or an internet cafe with no camera...
