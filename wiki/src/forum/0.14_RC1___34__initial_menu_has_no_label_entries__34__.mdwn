I used the Universal USB Installer to stuff the Tails 0.14 RC .iso file onto a USB stick, but i get the following error when booting: "initial menu has no label entries" and it just loops there without booting up.

0.13 works fine on the same stick, so it's probably not that nor the installer.

Sorry if this doesn't belong here, i tried looking through the reported bugs and known issues, either i'm blind or this wasn't listed.
