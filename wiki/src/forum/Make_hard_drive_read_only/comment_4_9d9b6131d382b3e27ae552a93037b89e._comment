palimpsest is great in Tails, it makes it so easy for the default user to (u)mount flash drives and other storage devices without mucking about with a sudo password and drive's files permissions.

people can opt to unplug their hard drives during Tails use or use Tails on a computer without a hard drive and mount flash and other drives to mount and exchange data.

please don't fsck this up. palimpsest is great.
