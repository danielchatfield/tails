You can already easily mount filesystems \"read only\" if you don't mind using the command line. Something like \"sudo mount -r /dev/whatever /wherever\" should do you.

    man mount

If that's not sufficient then blockdev can be used to set a device \"read only\" prior to being mounted normally... Something along the lines of \"sudo blockdev --setro /dev/whatever\" perhaps?

    man blockdev
