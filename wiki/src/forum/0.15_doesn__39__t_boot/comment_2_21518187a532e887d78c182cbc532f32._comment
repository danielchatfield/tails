Just created a USB stick using Universal USB Installer 1.9.20, with the tails-i386-0.15.iso image.

It gives me the same error mentioned above.

Is this part of the problem with the newest versions of UUI?  Or should I check settings in my BIOS?  I am able to boot with other USB drives, and my PC doesn't have an optical drive.
