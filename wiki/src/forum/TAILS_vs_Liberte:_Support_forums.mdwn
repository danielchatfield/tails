Libert√© used to have a forum at SourceForge.

Help forum <http://sourceforge.net/projects/liberte/forums/forum/1137582>

Open Discussion forum <http://sourceforge.net/projects/liberte/forums/forum/1137581>

This was recently closed to editing and a new forum created at <https://forum.dee.su/> (TAILS browser showed a warning for this security certificate.) The non-https <http://forum.dee.su/> also works.

This new forum requires that you sign in or create an account to make a new topic. You can sign in with a Facebook or Google account. That is convenient but Google is known for driving around spying on unprotected wifi and both of these companies are trying to make everyone use real names.

TAILS has an active support forum. The sorting of topics on this forum is confusing. It didn't bump a thread to the top when I posted to it. The dates can't be right. They all have the same date for "updated" and "started". Are the threads in the order that they were started?

Uncensored support forums are important for critical analysis because someone may know a problem and have no other way to communicate with the users and developers.
