> I started using disk utility for a while until I realised that it doesn't support \"plausible deniability\". That means that many governments around the world can just simply throw you in jail if they find a disk utility volume and you refuse not to give them the key to everything.

Crucial questions follow, please take them seriously.

Has anyone ever used the “plausible deniability” argument offered by TrueCrypt hidden volumes successfully as a legal argument? If not, has a lawyer in any country with relevant laws ever offered a legal opinion that is favorable towards hidden volumes?

By the way, LUKS supports hidden volumes, but it requires manual setup.
