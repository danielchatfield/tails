Indeed, it is not specific to Tails at all, and is therefore totally off-topic.
Please search the general Tor -related discussion places for numerous past discussion on this topic. Thank you.

> USE THE SEARCH BOX

On the Internet, full-caps writing is generally interpreted as shouting.
Please refrain from shouting at newcomers on this forum.

Specifically, redirecting people to the search box for questions related to Tails, that were already answered is totally fine, but I suggest *not* doing this for off-topic questions: else, we fail to communicate to newcomers what exactly is the scope of the topics that are welcome here. Thank you.
