The safest of all operating systems or safest that Tails can be? 

OpenBSD is the only OS I've heard of that has had only a few major security holes in it's history but Tails probably has a more common browser fingerprint. Tails seems to be best for privacy so long as its security isn't cracked while OpenBSD seems harder to crack.
