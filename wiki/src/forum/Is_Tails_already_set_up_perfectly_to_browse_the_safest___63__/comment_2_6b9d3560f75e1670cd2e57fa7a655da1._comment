Yes. ...and no. Tails is a security and anonymity orientated distro, it's carefully configured to accomplish these goals for a broad range of users. That can't be inferred to mean *perfectly*. These things are *always* something of a pragmatic compromise ;)

Obviously just booting the machine with Tails would be sufficient to avoid the vast majority of the malware likely to afflict your windows installation. If you have a serious concern about root kits and the like then you should be using *only* Tails on dedicated trusted hardware.

The necessity, only you can decide. Where you'll find the compromise between risk/paranoia and convenience/practicality will depend upon how *you* perceive those things in *your* particular situation.
