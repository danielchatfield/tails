These instructions unfortionatly no longer work with the current version of TAILS.

The lines:

cp -a /etc/X11/xorg.conf /mnt/chroot/etc/X11
cp -a /etc/gdm/gdm.conf /mnt/chroot/etc/gdm

are not valid for the current version of TAILS.

Looks like X11 and gdm have been updated.
/etc/X11/xorg.conf
/etc/gdm/gdm.conf
no longer exist.  Note GRUB has been updated too.
I try these steps and I can't get past a GRUB boot error.

This software is great but, I need some persistent space.  I've been trying to set up a VirtualBox VM using TAILS but, so far I have no persistance.

HELP!!!
