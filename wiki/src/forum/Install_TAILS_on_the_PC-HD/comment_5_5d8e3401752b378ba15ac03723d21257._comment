Here are a few minor remarks about this pretty good howto.

First, note that such an installed system can actually be considered
as a **fork** of T(A)ILS: after this process has been completed, any
privacy/security/anonymity issue discovered in T(A)ILS will need to be
fixed inside the forked system *by its administrator*. Debian security
support is of course pretty good, but it covers neither the specific
privacy/anonymity leaks we have discovered (and fixed) in T(A)ILS in
the past... nor the ones that we will discover (and fix) in the
future. I really want to insist: once you have completed this
installation process, you are on your own and you need to closely
follow the T(A)ILS security announces (if not its whole development)
unless you are happy with a false sense of security.

    rm /etc/sudoers
    echo \"root ALL=(ALL) ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers
    echo \"amnesia ALL=(ALL) ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers

> IIRC members of the `sudo` group get sudo (with no password). Maybe

> (if password is required) simply append the line for the amnesia
> user to `/etc/sudoers` would be a bit more robust IMHO.

    # Remove some livecd specific stuff
    apt-get remove --yes live-helper live-initramfs aufs-modules-*

> This is specific to T(A)ILS 0.5. Next releases will have
> `live-build` rather than `live-helper`, and `live-boot` +
> `live-config` instead of `live-initramfs`.
