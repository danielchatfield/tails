It could be something as simple as the equivalent of increasing the `MaxCircuitDirtiness` in mainline Tor to some high number, which effectively make your connections use the same circuit == the same Exit Node == the same IP address for a longer time, which probably makes Facebook happier. But it's hard to tell...

AdvOR was forked from mainline Tor around three years ago. Given how its sources are published (just a .zip, no source control AFAICT) it's very hard to follow up on any changes it introduces, and any (important) changes from mainline Tor it *does not* include. There's little (none?) documentation either.

This and the author's complete absense in the Tor community are some pretty strong warning signs, IMHO. Not to mention that any difference in behaviour from mainline Tor will put AdvOR users into their own relatively tiny partition of \"Tor\" users, which sucks for anonymity. Also see [Nick Mathewson's (Tor's Chief Architect) analysis](http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2010/msg00026.html) for some enlightenment.
