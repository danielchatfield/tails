> I2P latest update is now 0.9.5 

We're aware of this, as our [[contribute/release process]] and
[[test suite|contribute/release_process/test]] have steps about
this. But sorry, we did not feel like delaying the serious
Iceweasel and Linux security updates to upgrade and test I2P.
Also, `http://killyourtv.i2p.to/debian' being down does not help.
