How vulnerable was anyone who used Tails 0.17 since the discovery of the \"numerous security holes\"?

Isn't this really an inherent paradox with Tails?

Since:
a) vulnerabilities are being discovered *continually* ,
and,
b) It is simply not feasible for Tails releases to keep up,

the result, inevitably is that any given release of Tails becomes subject to unpatched vulnerabilities within days of being released.
