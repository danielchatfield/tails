@ anyone who doesn't get the rationale for version 0.17.1:

The new version includes a bugfix for serious security issues with sudo and perl, which are I think fairly essential components of a properly functioning Tails system, so unless I am missing something, the line about \"every Tails user must immediately upgrade\" is accurate.

Don't forget to carefully verify the iso image before burning it to a live DVD!
