Sorry peops... hadn't seen these. I've found my laptops' wifi kill buttons don't function until the moment a suitably sophisticated has been booted... so when booting with wifi **on**, the kill button does nothing if pressed during the BIOS stage, does nothing during the GRUB stage, then suddenly becomes effective almost immediately after that... as soon as GRUB has handed the machine over to the kernel/initrd... that's as soon as you see *Linux* generated text or splash. Disabling WiFi this way, the WiFi toggle switch continues to function correctly throughout the session.

So, the button should be toggled **on** before boot (or during the previous shutdown)... it'll become functional very early during boot (just keep pressing it until it has an effect if you like - and if you have a functional WiFi indicator LED) and you can then turn **off** the WiFi. i.e. before any network deamons have started snooping around for newtorks and leaking your MAC. You can then toggle WiFi back on once you & macchanger are ready at a terminal.

Hope this helps. WFM ;-)
