Hi there. Can't seem to re-enable wifi using switch after doing macchanger. This is exactly what I do:

1. Start up and turn off wifi via switch when suggested
2. Type in terminal \"ifconfig wlan0 down\" otherwise resources remain busy and cannot use macchanger
3. Type in terminal \"macchanger -a wlan0\" then \"macchanger -s wlan0\" to see if it worked
4. Type in terminal \"ifconfig wlan0 up\" to enable wlan0 again
5. Try to use toggle switch on Acer model, LED does not activate. Try holding for 3, 5, 10 and 20 seconds.. nothing. Can't connect to networks

This is OP and I still need help re-enabling wifi. Any suggestions?
