>Probably not by merely installing a SCIM package that will be in next Tails release. 

Yeah, maybe I'll try that. But would you be kind enough as to comment on the input text into a text file using scmi-anthy in another computer, copy that into a USB thumb drive, open the text file in Tails, copy the text and paste it into your favorite e-mail client? I think this works, but I was wondering whether using this method could mess up my system. 

NOTE: I'm not trolling. I think Tails is a great operating system, but I need Japanese input NOW, not when 0.14 comes out, which will probably be a couple months from now.
