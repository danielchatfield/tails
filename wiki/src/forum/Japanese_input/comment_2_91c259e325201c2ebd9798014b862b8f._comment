> As of 0.13 Tails offers very limited support for Japanese. I know that 0.14 will become with Anthy, but until it comes out I was wondering if there's a way to mitigate this problem.

Yes. Install the `scim-anthy` package using Synaptic. You'll need to setup an administrator password first, as [[explained in the documentation|doc]].
