Yeah, but what if there's a bug and that bugs makes Tails leak my IP. I only use Iceweasel, but I'm afraid 0.14 rc1 might end up disclosing my real location.
So, I really need you to answer my question about copy/pasting Japanese text. Is it safe? Yes, no, or don't know. That's all I need to know and I won't bother you anymore.
