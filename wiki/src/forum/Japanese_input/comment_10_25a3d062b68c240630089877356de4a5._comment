> The release candidates are tested as much as gold releases.

So, what this means is that, after throughly testing 0.14, the developers decided to release 0.14 rc1 to the public so that regular users could test the software?

Does this mean that there won't be much (if any, at all) between 0.14 rc1 and stable 0.14?
