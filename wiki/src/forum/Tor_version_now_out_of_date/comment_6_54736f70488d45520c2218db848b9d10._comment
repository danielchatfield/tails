When the TOR project releases a version:

\"Tor 0.2.2.34 fixes a critical anonymity vulnerability where an attacker
can deanonymize Tor users. Everybody should upgrade.\"

and tails doesn't have the ability to keep up there is a bit of a problem.

A mechanism for keeping the central software up to date seems like a fairly important issue.

If pre 0.2.2.34 tor exposes an anonymity vulnerability where an attacker can deanonymize Tor users it seems fairly likely the Tails is equally exposed.
