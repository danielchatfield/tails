Hi,

I see with pleasure that Tails is part of your selection.

The version you ship is 0.12.1, but Tails 0.13 is now available, and fix numerous security issues.

Can you please update your article, and perhaps instead of a direct download, redirect to the download page on Tails website (https://tails.boum.org/download), that explain how to verify and install the downloaded ISO file?

Greetings,
Marc
