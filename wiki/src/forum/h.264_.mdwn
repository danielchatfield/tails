H.264 codec for youtube?

Surfing youtube I came mor and more often across the trial for HTML5 video. And on that site(https://www.youtube.com/html5) it says that Iceweasel does not support h.264. 

So do I have to download a h.264 codec additionaly?

Or is this a hardware specific Problem?
I use a "stoneage" Geforce 6600GT 128MB, wiki says it should support h.264 offloading.


Sorry for that probably silly question, I'm a Noob on Linux.
Comming from Windows I woud suggest I have to install a H.264 codec....
