>Guys... If i use Tails, my ISP can see what i am doing.....right?

If they can be bothered to look they can \"see\" that you're connecting via Tor.

If they try *REALLY* hard they *might* be able to *infer* that you're connecting via Tor *from Tails*.

They can probably \"see\"/infer very little if anything else.

If you use an Obfsproxy bridge (now in devel so possibly (hopefully) heading into Tails 0.15) that'll be reduced to being able to see that you're using a VPN or some other SSL-point-2-pont tunnel such as but not necessarily Tor.
