See what you are doing?  You mean like screenshots in real-time?  

Or the log of a secretly installed keylogger uploaded by a remote attacker?

If you verified the iso image of Tails 0.14 which you downloaded, and burned it to DVD using a \"clean\" computer, I think it should be difficult for a remote attacker to easily install a keylogger or other malware in RAM.  (One advantage of using a R/O DVD is that the binaries on the DVD cannot be tampered with, although a sophisticated attacker might be able to tamper with binaries which have been loaded into RAM.)

Are you sure you mean ISP (Internet Service Provider) and not some other three letter acronym?

Depending upon where you live, ISPs as corporate entities might now want to waste employee time doing more surveillance than is legally required, so they typically hire third parties to surveil users.  Supposedly these third parties are only looking for evidence that any user (not a particular user) are doing something objectionable to some government.  Some say that using Tor can make this difficult for them.

As the Petraeus scandal illustrates, if you have pissed off someone with access to echelon data, to RAT tools, to APT malware, someone who knows your IP address and is confident of their ability to harm you in order to pursue a grudge without getting caught, such as, allegedly, an NYPD detective offering his services as a hit man, or rogue FBI agents, or other kinds of secret policemen with an axe to grind, you probably do face an elevated risk of being personally targeted by a sophisticated remote attacker.

One of the many fascinating unanswered questions in that case is whether or not sometimes shirtless FBI agent Fred Humphries (who until recently was best known in the FBI as the agent who first recognized that one \"Beni Noris\" was an Algerian, not born in Montreal as his identity claimed; \"Noris\" turned out to be Ahmed Ressam) used remote intrusion tools to plant a keylogger or other malware on

* the computer used by Paula Broadwell
* the computer used by Jill Kelley (Gilberte Kelley)
* the computer used by then D/CIA Petraeus

Is something like that what you are worried about?
