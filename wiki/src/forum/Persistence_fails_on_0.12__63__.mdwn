Please help,

I have got Tails 0.12 running fine on a Sandisk Cruzer Blade 16gb USB stick. However when trying to create a persistence volume on the USB, it fails and gives error:

org.freedesktop.UDisksx.Error.Busy: A job is pending on /dev/sdc2

Looking at a similar case shown on "https://tails.boum.org/forum/persistence_wizared_-_failed/", I had looked into changing the timeout value at line 696 of /usr/share/perl5/Tails/Persistence/Setup.pm, but this did not work. 

Was I correct in using the terminal commands 'sudo bash' then 'sudo nautilus' to access superuser mode in order to save the amended timeout change? Sadly I am a Windows user and have virtually no Linux experience!

Apparently this was said to have been fixed in 0.12, but clearly hasn't.

Please advise how I am able to simply create a persistence volume on the USB?

Cheers!
