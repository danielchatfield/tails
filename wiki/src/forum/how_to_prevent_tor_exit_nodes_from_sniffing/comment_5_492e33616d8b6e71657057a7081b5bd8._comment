I was about to say that I have no idea why the text for the link I posted in the above comment (4) is so large, when I noticed that the **solid line** I had entered as a divider between the two parts of my post had vanished. Seems like *that*, the line, caused the link-text to enlarge. 

Yet, just like the quirk with the dots (periods), I can find no mention at
