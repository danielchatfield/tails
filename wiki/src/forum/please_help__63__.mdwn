I know this may be off subject but it applies for Tails. I need a good email that is easy to access like softhome.net which doesnt sign up anymore by the way. one that has no problem with changing ip's and is not loaded down with javascript like yahoo and gmail less java more security. tormail goes down sometimes, so any thoughts thanks. sorry if this isnt the right spot to put this.
