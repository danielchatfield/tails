@ 8,9:

Please stop the name-calling.  Others here do not think the OP is insincere and we are willing to try to help.  If you are not, please try to help another poster in another thread, OK?

@ OP:

Experienced Tor users know that some tasks seem baffling until the day comes when we \"get it\", and after that we find it hard to remember why we once found it so hard!

The problem you face is verifying that the Tails iso images you download are genuine.  In crypto circles we call that \"authentication\".  Cryptographic hashes like MD-5, SHA-1, SHA-256 are not designed for authentication of security-sensitive iso images but to guard against corruption by noise.  In other words, they are good for dealing with things which happen naturally (like random noise on noisy communication channels), but not for foiling human adversaries.  The NSA has been working hard for years (with fair success in \"practical forgery\") on subverting hashes like MD-5.  That is why others are urging you to focus on verifying the iso images you download using GPG as explained in the documentation

* <https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#verify>

At a trusted keyserver like 

* <http://pgp.mit.edu>

try searching for

    tails signing key

or

    0xBE2CD9C1

If you install that into your gpg keyring, and then examine it using 

    gpg --list-keys

you should see the designation

>   T(A)ILS developers (signing key) <amnesia@boum.org>

and a fingerprint which ends in 

   BE2C D9C1

This is evidence that you have the genuine public key you need to verify Tails iso images.  You can get more by downloading some of the keys which have been used to sign the Tails signing key, and verifying the signatures.  We can help you do that if you are interested.

Best of all would be to develop a chain of GPG keys connecting someone you know well to one of the persons who has signed the Tails signing key.  If you are fortunate enough to live in a place with a Linux Users group, that might well be achievable with some persistent effort.

If the problem is that strong cryptography is illegal where you live, we might be able to help you with that also.
