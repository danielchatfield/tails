Absolutely.

Although, WRT:

>On what basis is that server \"trusted\"? Just because many Facebook members say so?

It isn't. It can't be. It was never intended to be... and it doesn't matter that it isn't! The PKI system was designed to allow for that. It's what the \"long fingerprint\" (a cryptographic hash) is for - you can safely trust and use a key obtained from any insecure source/repository - such as a webpage or keyserver - as long as you check its validity by securely confirming its \"fingerprint\" with its owner. There is no MiTM: No trusted third party, etc. This is why PKI is so much better than SSL etc. **You** determine validity/trust **yourself**... of course that does leave the situation slightly difficult if you having to establish trusted communication with a party you *don't* already know and communicate with (a strange, oxymoronic and rather perverse concept when you think about it... made all the more bizarre by the existing \"solution\" of \"trusting\" some another obscure *third party* to say so! weird ideas!) - hence stuff like [this](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html) and [this](https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/trust/index.en.html)
