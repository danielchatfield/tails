There's never a need for name-calling!

OP: What is the information you're still missing? You received plenty of helpful advice in your [previous thread](https://tails.boum.org/forum/0.16~rc1/) including a [link to one of the many threads (you?) started in this vein before](https://tails.boum.org/forum/0.13-rc1_Hashes/). There's plenty of excellent advice in the replies to that thread too. Have a read! Some well meaning soul has already posted the (\"worthless\") hashes you claim to \"need\" in [your previous thread](https://tails.boum.org/forum/0.16~rc1/). Did you miss that? What more can you possibly want? What are you hoping to achieve with this thread?
