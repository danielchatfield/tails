>>If you use sha256sum to calculate it, how do you know the downloaded .iso was not tampered with or contains errors and so the checksum is false?

>If several of us post their checksums here and they are all the same, then you can be sure that your downloaded ISO hasn't been tampered with.

That is incorrect. You obtain the ISO from a link provided on this site. If some powerful adversary has taken the trouble to \"tamper with\" it, they'll probably have thought to \"tamper with\" the rest of the representation of this site which you receive too. That would include any presentation of hashes. Wouldn't you think? Or don't you think this powerful adversary of yours knows how to generate a hash of their \"tampered with\" Tails?

Can you think?

There's something called a signature which solves these problems and provides you with a SECURE means to VERIFY your download. If you wanted security that would have sunken in by now... so... what are you trying to do here?
