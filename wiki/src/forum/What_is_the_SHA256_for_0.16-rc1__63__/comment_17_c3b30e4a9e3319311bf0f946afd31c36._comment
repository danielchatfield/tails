Thanks to all who tried to help.

To the naysayers, I tried to verify with Kleoprata first but it didn't work. I don't use Tails for anything really important and mostly use it to play with and taunt the Surveillance Society, so I thought the hash would do to make sure the testing download was valid and error free. It is after all an RC.

Maybe I'll go back into windows and try Kleoprata again or the commandline just for the hell of it. But the hash at download would have been very simple and Tails does recomend doing that as one possible solution. The posted hash was for 0.15 though and so of course it didn't match, which could cause a panic.
