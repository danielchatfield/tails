Amen.

It is difficult to write with precision without getting called out for \"using too many words\".

Let me try again.  I think that what everyone is suggesting here comes down to this:

Indeed, as you fear, there are no ironclad guarantees when it comes to authentication, security, and anonymity.   There are only procedures which offer better authentication, better security, and better anonymity.  And each day, each of us must decide for herself/himself how much effort we are able and willing to devote to further improvements.

The same point is often made by Bruce Schneier.  Authentication, security, anonymity are always \"works in progress\" rather than on/off states.  Instead of imagining a peak on whose summit you can imagine standing one day, focus on simply trying to increase your elevation relative to where you stand today.
