  - From the \"network map\" window of Vidalia, you can see all the open Tor circuits and the host they are connecting to.
  - If you want to monitor network connections a bit more closely you can execute the `sudo netstat -aelptun` command after setting up an administration password.
  - If you want to monitor all the network traffic coming out of the operating system you can use [Wireshark]. But explaining you how to do that is outside of the scope of this forum.
