Hello, after loading multiple programs to get one program to work, I finally made it to the part where you are supposed to right click on the pgp file and decrypt and verify. I am trying to do this in windows. I choose the pgp file for the first file, click the first box, and choose the iso file for the data file. I leave the output file box alone. I keep getting the error message the validity of the signature can not be verified. I would love to know what I'm doing wrong, otherwise i'll have to try using truecrypt and ubuntu all manually, which I was hoping this would avoid. Perhaps in your installation instructions, you could use/include a sample of what to fill in the screen with, rather than just abandoning us to some template on their website that doesn't apply.
