Hi,
the new Tails is not bad but something is broken?:

-in File Browser root login password  unaccepted
-mouse over lock symbyol in URL tab don't work
-crippled things described here:https://tails.boum.org/forum/Customize_Toolbar_dont_work/

Have installed it with  UniversalUSBInstaller on MSwindows, too.
ISO seems to be OK.
