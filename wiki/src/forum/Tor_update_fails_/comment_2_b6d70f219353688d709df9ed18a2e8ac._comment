I am running it from the cd and it was asking for a password. However I searched for the password and asked if anyone knew it or a work around. I got no answer. Can't access the administrator account without it. I even tried init=/bin/bash at boot to change the password. However nothing seemed to work. While in bash there was no command to start grub and finish booting that would work.
