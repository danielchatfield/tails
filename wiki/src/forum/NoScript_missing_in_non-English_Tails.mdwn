After choosing Chinese as the language of choice, I boot into Tails using live DVD.

I noticed that NoScript is missing from Iceweasel. (NoScript button is present in Iceweasel when one is using the English language version of Tails.)

Question #1: is this a bug in the Chinese language version of Iceweasel?

Question #2: is it essential to have NoScript addon in Iceweasel?

Question #3: if it is essential, how do you install NoScript?

Any help is welcome.
