> Unless said gov't were to control enough (multiple) exit nodes and correlate traffic, right?

Close but not quite, owning multiple exit servers doesn't really increase their chances of being able to correlate data, owning multiple entry nodes and exit nodes however would increase that chance slightly.

But it should be noted that TOR is designed such that even if we assume that all TOR servers are government run it would still be extremely hard if not impossible to directly correlate somebody's traffic because of various techniques that TOR uses to make the data harder to correlate combined with the large amount of traffic a single node tends to get.
