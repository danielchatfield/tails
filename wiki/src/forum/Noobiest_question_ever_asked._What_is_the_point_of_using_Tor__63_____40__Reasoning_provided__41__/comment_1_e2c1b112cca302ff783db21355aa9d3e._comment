> Tor exit nodes can see plain text traffic and **orginal IP address**

And there is the fundamental misunderstanding that makes you ask this question in the first place.

The exit node cannot see the original address, only the entry node can, and the entry node cannot decrypt the data you are sending only the exit node can.

So in other words, no you don't need to trust neither the Entry node or the Exit node to use TOR.
