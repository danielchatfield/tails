> Thanks for your explaination, I will go through the documentation in more detail. These were my first thoughts right after being introduced to Tor.

[This visual explanation](https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https) might make the Who-Knows-What of Tor clearer. I suggest you study what information is available to each agent in the picture when Tor is enabled, and make note that no single agent knows both your location and the destination your are trying to access. That will also shed some light on your next question:

> I hope you can comment on the -Goverments running exit nodes part- please.

If your Government is in control of a Tor Exit node that you happen to use, they see which website you are accessing, and if you are not using HTTPS, they see all data you send to and receive from the website. The will *not* know who they are eavesdropping on (i.e. your location), thanks to Tor, and that is what Tor adds in terms of anonymity.
