Hi 

Disabling javascript seems to make Panopticlick's fingerprint results significantly better. I'm aware that many websites lose it's functionality without javascript, but isn't it good idea to keep in disable by default and enable it only when realy needed?
I always thought that javascript is something bad for privacy was I wrong?

On the other hand when I disable javascript, will I be distinguishable from others Tails/Tor users who keep it enable?
