Two years ago, I downloaded Incognito and subsequently Tails. Unfortunately, I rarely have gotten Tails started. Every hotel, internet cafe and restaurant in the United States that I attempted to use Tails at requires checking a box that I agree with the terms on their webpage. 

Tails prohibits this by automatically going to the TOR home page. I attempted to turn off TOR so I could check the box to agree and then turn TOR back on. I do not know how to do this. Tails documentation on how to start TOR does not include this. It should. I could not find any discussion on how to start a browser and then TOR in any part of the documentation.

It took researching on the internet to find other privacy live CDs and liberte's link to Tails web page that discusses this problem. https://tails.boum.org/todo/add_support_for_free_wifi_hotspots/

Unfortunately, this discussion does not instruct how to turn off TOR, check I agree, and turn TOR back on. How can I use Tails?

I haven't used Liberte's live CD but anticipate problems because their documentation does not provide instructions on this either.
