>Can you recommend any command line kung fu to convert txt to jpeg?

\"imagemagik\"

    man convert

With the above, you could, for example, render your text in any arbitrary font filled and or outlined in any arbitrary colour or texture, superimpose said text over arbitrary textures/backgrounds (tessellated bg if you like, generated on-the-fly if you choose), at arbitrary transparency, before and/or after applying any number of arbitrary distortions/effects, superimpose other textures again with arbitrary transparency and blend mode... etc... etc... Everything you could possibly need to roll your own capatchas and much more.

[This](http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/text/) is probably a good place to start ;-)
