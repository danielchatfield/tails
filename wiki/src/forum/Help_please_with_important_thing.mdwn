Thank you for help. I am not smart with computer things. In my country is much repression and I want to be safe but be able to reach others who want freedom.I have friend who was put in jail when they found communication between people on his computer and he was using TOR. my question is If my computer is off and I have Tails/TOR on bootable USB and boot up into Tails/Tor without going into Windows and when I am done just get out of Tails/TOR and turn off computer and then hide USB, am I safe if police check my computer? Is everything I say and do on the USB, or can police find my communication on hard drive of my computer?
Thank you for help!
