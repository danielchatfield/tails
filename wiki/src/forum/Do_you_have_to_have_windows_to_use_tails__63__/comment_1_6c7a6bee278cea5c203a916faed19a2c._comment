>Can you use tails without having an operation system on your computer at all?

Yes. Tails *is* an operating system.

>When I download the tails iso image should I be using winrar?

No. You should \"burn\" the .iso to DVD or create a bootable flash drive from it.

>thats what comes up when I click on it. Can you deownload tails using the public pgp key without having to verify signitures?

It's *always* wise to verify your download. Especially so if you're trying to create a secure environment! ;)
