TAILS is indeed an OS (operating system) in and of itself and should work on the vast majority of functioning computers in use today.

But, of course, in order to *obtain* TAILS (i.e., download the ISO file, verify it and then burn it to DVD or flash media) access to a computer with a functioning OS will be necessary.

This need not be *Windows*; nearly any \"Linux\" (more properly, \"GNU/Linux\") distro and most other current operating systems should be adequate for the task of downloading TAILS, verifying the download and then burning it to media.
