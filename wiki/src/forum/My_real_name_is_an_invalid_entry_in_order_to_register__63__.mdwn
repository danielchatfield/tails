I wanted to comment in regard to Adobe Flash.Yes,if you remove Flash then you will not be able to use many websites such as not so benign PBS but you can at least try to control Flash. You can use BetterPrivacy in Firefox or you can right click on the video(not the page)which will give you access to the hidden control panel where you can remove the Local Stored Objects(LSOs),Super Cookies or Flash Cookies whatever you want to call them, manually.Also,while you are the there make sure that the other isidious & dangerous Adobe crap,your private webcam/microphone is not enabled otherwise some other computer can turn these on remotley.Buyer beware!
