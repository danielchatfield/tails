Hello, 

I've just downloaded and installed Tails. Burned on DVD and then to USB. I was using USB on my PC - I could reboot/shutdown it w/o problems. Then I put it into laptop. Tails is working perfectly but when I try to shut it down or reboot it. I got the messagess and after you can remove USB i got just screen full of some kind of lines and it will not reboot/shutdown itself so I have to turn it off by holding the start button. Any solutions please ? 

Thanks
