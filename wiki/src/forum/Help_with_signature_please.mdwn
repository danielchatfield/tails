Using Windows, I think I've installed the signing key into Gpg4win; Kleopatra says it's valid and comes from Tails devs etc.

But the instructions for the signature make no sense to me:

"Now check the integrity of the file that has just been signed, i.e. check that it is correct!

To check for integrity and authenticity, the signature file - hence the file with the ending .sig, .asc, .p7s or .pem - ...."

1. Just been signed??

2. The Tails signature ends :.iso.pgp

And if I right-click, and select Decrypt and Verify, then the 'signed data' window is blank unlike the example, and clicking on the 'Decrypt/Verify' button produces 'verification failed:no data'

Am  I supposed to do the copy past routine to a text editor and re-save this one as a .asc file (as I did to import the signing key)?

Tried that anyway, but there are odd box characters either end of the '....END PGP SIGNATURE....' bit. I didn't know whether to include the last one. Anyway, all I tried gave verification errors.

I've wasted several hours on this cr*p btw. grrrrrrrrr
