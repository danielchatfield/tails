The one and only torrc file is the one in /etc/tor/torrc. Which other torrc file are you referring to?

You can edit it doing:

    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
    sudo service tor reload

Regarding how to get a root terminal, please refer to the end of [[/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]].
