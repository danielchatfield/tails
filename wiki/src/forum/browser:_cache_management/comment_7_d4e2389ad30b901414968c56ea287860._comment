with Tails0.17 on lowerRAM(~500MB) PCs 'Minimize memory usage'(about:memory;iceweasel) has almost no effect. No problems in TAILS0.16 .
some symptoms after hours browsing with iceweasel e.g. :
- 4 ghost-windows
- storage-sqlite grows from 4 to 13MB
- vsize grows from ~374MB to ~526MB
browser reacts slow, 'unresponsive script' window,usb-LED blinks very often.....

click on 'Minimize memory usage' has almost no effect.
Close browser + start browser helps.
