Regarding GRC \"Shields-UP!\", I believe that there is broad consensus among security experts that the whole obsession with \"Stealthed\" ports that GRC makes such a fuss over should be completely disregarded. 

What matters is whether ports are open or closed.

But this doesn't actually pertain to Tails.
