I created the usb from a dvd image and when I try to boot the usb thumb drive it says "Operation System Not Found". I tried it a second time with the same result. I tried moving it from a usb 3.0 to usb 2.0 slot with same result. I have been able to boot other versions of linux from the usb such as Liberte, any ideas?
