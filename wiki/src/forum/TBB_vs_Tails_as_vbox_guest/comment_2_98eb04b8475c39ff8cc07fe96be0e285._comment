as stated, the intent is mainly anonymous browsing - to avoid snooping from ISPs governments and websites.

I also want to use the tor network daily to support it and to add more anonymity for others through my own usage.

I live in a western \"democracy\". I have no immediate concerns for my physical safety nor is there any good reason for me to be singled out and spied upon. This is just basic citizen stuff.

So just for this anonymous browsing I am not sure if running tails in virtualbox is worth the extra hassle and system resources. The virtualbox install will only be as secure as the linux host system anyway. I also have Tails on USB stick for when I am out of the house or in case something seriously dodgy comes up (I have tried running it natively on a day-to-day basis and it is not usable enough for me so please don't suggest this).

After trying both I am currently leaning towards the TBB as it's simpler to use and because it should be easier for me to ease myself off of the advantages of the regular internet with it(specifically as I can alt-tab out to initiate big downloads or watch video and there is no constant 25% performance cost for running the VM). I thought I would ask here for perhaps more technical merits in the form of pros and cons. 

I already have an idea for such merits, such as the vm working like a super secure sandbox which will be offer greater resistance to exploits. But considering my usage, this isn't going to be my biggest concern anyway.

So please, any technical thoughts, personal experiences and preferences on the matter would be gratefully appreciated.
