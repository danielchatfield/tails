Thankyou for your response,

With some more consideration I've decided to stick to Tails as a virtualbox guest to my linux host.

The tbb alone seems vulnerable to me.

I would have liked to be able to boot directly from a regular tails usb stick but to do so would require running vbox as root so now I'm just running from an iso file with most of the vbox settings disabled (no hardisk/usb/3d acceleration)

I have chosen to enable the virtualization option in my bios though - which I suppose might not be very secure. As I understand it, it grants some basic access to the hypervisor but I'm not sure how this could be exploited in the context of tails. I haven't found any good information regarding the security risks of this feature yet but enabling it seems to improve the performace (less cpu load).

I have already looked at the security section of the vbox manual, but regarding running tails specifically I was wondering if there are any little tricks to use when setting up the virtual machine with regard to either security or usability?

thanks again
