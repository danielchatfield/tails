`amnesia@amnesia:~$ python --version
Python 2.6.6
amnesia@amnesia:~$ which python
/usr/bin/python
amnesia@amnesia:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/python*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root       9 26 nov 11.43 /usr/bin/python -> python2.6
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2288272 27 dec  2010 /usr/bin/python2.6`

Seems only Python 2.6 is installed. But Python 3 should be installable, since it is available on Debian Squeeze (and thus Tails) under the name python3. I don't think the Tails developers want both Python2.6 and Python3 on the ISO due to the size however.

The rest I think the Tails developers can answer better.
