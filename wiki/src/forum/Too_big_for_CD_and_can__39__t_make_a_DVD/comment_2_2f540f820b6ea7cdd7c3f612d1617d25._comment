OP, maybe I misunderstood, but here is a stupid question:

Did you try to burn a DVD (correct) or a CD (incorrect) from the iso image?

(The Tails documentation could perhaps stress more emphatically that more recent editions of Tails are too large to fit on a CD so must be burned to a DVD.)

If you did try to burn the image to a DVD, and if the computer you used has no trouble burning other iso images to a DVD, I can only suggest that 

* if possible, borrow another computer and try to download, verify and burn the DVD using that computer
* you experiment with the problem computer by trying to burn a smaller iso image to CD and DVD so see if your burner might have broken
