I'm sorry this confused you. I'm curious what such a notice would have changed, practically, for you.

The download link is HTTP, not HTTPS. I think this is enough to discourage most people to trust the downloaded content on the basis of whatever DNS name the link contains.

Given the Tails download documentation extensively covers why and how one should carefully verify the ISO they've downloaded, I don't see the need to add the notice you are suggesting.
