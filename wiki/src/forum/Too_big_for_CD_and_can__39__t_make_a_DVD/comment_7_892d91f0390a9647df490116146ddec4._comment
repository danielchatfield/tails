I verified that my original ISO was fully intact.   

I was VERY surprised that such a massive effort is made on this site to: \"make sure no one has modified the ISO\".

I have *NEVER* gotten a modified or damaged ISO in my life.

Besides, I get the ISO directly from tails.boum.org, never anywhere else.

Has tails.boum.org had a massive problem with many fake/modified/damaged ISOs before?
