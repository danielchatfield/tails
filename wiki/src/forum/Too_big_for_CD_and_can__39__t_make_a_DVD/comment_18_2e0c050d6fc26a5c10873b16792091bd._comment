I haven't used Tails in a while ever since I rolled my own openbsd live CD with virtualized routing and came back to check on the project. 800+ megs wtf?? Seems like the complexity is just growing way too much. Did gnome inflate the size or were some ginormous packages added? Curious how it went from CD sized to DVD size
