@ OP:

Welcome to the forum!

If you are running Tails now, look for an icon which resembles the firefox icon with the fox replaced with a silver animal (a weasel).  This is the icon for Iceweasel (actually Tails browser, a version of Iceweasel).  Iceweasel and Firefox are functionally identical and there are few differences in how you configure them and use them to browse/download.  See 

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceweasel

However, standard Iceweasel/Firefox are not optimized for privacy/anonymity while using Tor to browse/download.  That is why the Tails browser variant of Iceweasel has some modifications.  And why installing some other browser (or any software, potentially) is not a good idea unless you understand the potential impacts on anonymity.

If you wanted to install plain vanilla Firefox as an \"untrusted browser\" for decoy purposes, Tails already has such a thing.

See <https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html> for some other things to avoid while using Tails.
