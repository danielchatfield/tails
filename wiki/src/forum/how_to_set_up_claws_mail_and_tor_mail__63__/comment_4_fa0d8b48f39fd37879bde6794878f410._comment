So now that I got riseup account, Ive tried to setup as instructed on thier web but now I get a below error.

Error:
Claws mail has detected a config mailbox, but it is incomplete. it is possibly due to a failing IMAP account. User Rebuild folder tree on the mialbox parent folders contect menu to try to fix it.

Protocol IMAP4
Receive/send both mail.riseup.net
Marked SSL option for both connections. 
SMTP port(465) and IMAP4(993) port both unmarked.

Do I have to mark these ports?
