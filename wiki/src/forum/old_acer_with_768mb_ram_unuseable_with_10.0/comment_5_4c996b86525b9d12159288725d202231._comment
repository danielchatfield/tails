perhaps the OP's aspirations for tails are too high. The second poster has much smaller specs but doesn't seem to complain.

what quality youtube videos can you watch without stutter... 720p, 480p etc?

I have 1.6 ghz/1gb of ram and the lowest quaity setting on youtube isn't smooth in a window or full screen.

My experience so far is that tails is quite sluggish when compared other OS's I run on the same computer. It would be interesting to know whether tails suffers on certain hardware.
