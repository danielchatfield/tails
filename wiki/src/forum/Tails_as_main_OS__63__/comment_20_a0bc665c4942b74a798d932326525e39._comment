>No matter how you access your Internet bank (or buy stuff with a credit card, or deal with money in any other kind of way), I suggest that you always check the SSL certificate's fingerprint before you give up any revealing information (this implies only using banks/shops that employs HTTPS). To get the fingerprint, call your bank (or the shop owner). This makes it impossible for an attacker to mount any type of Man-in-the-middle attack unless the attacker also MitMs the above mentioned phone call :).

This is why you should insist that the one you are calling read the fingerprint to you first, and not vice versa. 

I saw this advice in a [StackExchange post](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/12066/can-i-detect-a-mitm-attack) I came across. Here is the quote:

>Absolute paranoia demands you to call the system admin on phone and confirm the fingerprint by making **him** speak the key. Remember, you should not speak the key lest he'd say 'YES' only for you to discover later that your phone connection was also MITMed :) (funny as it may sound but its not difficult for an attacker to simple change the 'support phone number' on the website where you'd call to verify the key.)

The last sentence, within the parentheses, makes me wonder why \"Tails\" seemingly poo-pooed such a possibility with the placement of the emoticon.
