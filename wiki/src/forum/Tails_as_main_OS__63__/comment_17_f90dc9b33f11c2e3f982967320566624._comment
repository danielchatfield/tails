OP again (and author of post 13).

Would just like to thanks again the Tails dev again for driving through the point wrt avoiding MITML by manually checking certificate fingerprints.. In the rare cases when I do actually use personal info from now on I will be making a point of checking these.

I do still feel that on some level a paid for VPN has more accountability than a random TOR as exit but I promise that the points made are not lost on me by a long shot. I actively avoid having to trust 3rd parties anyway (by avoiding online services as much as possible) so any debate from my part is mostly for educational purposes but again thankyou for helping to make things crystal clear (...I hope it is not too frustrating...).

In my tails as a main OS experiment, I have not found an adequate solution for youtube videos yet. I have been researching mp4 pluggins for the mobile site as well as downloader plugins to download swf files directly but am yet to really try anything as no option has appealed to me sufficiently. Ultimately I don't want to install extra plugins for the obvious reasons so any other ideas would be great.

I also have a new question - How much bandwith is reasonable for a day's worth of TOR usage? Without downloading TV (movies and tv shows) I think that my browsing must add up to 2-4 gb a month. If I were to download TV I could see that easily being more like 500-900 mb a day. I have read many TOR articles about the ill effects of torrenting on the health of the network etc. but I'm not sure of how much usage is considered fair game. I suppose the math comes down to total bandwith(I believe its in the order of 2500mb/second)/number of users (400k) which comes down to an average of 22.5mb per hour or 540mb per day for each user. I would like to know if anyone with experience with TOR has their own subjective opinion on this though.


thanks
