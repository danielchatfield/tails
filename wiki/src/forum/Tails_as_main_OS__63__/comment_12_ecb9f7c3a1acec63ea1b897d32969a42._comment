> if the ssl fails then using tor would make you more vulnerable. hopefully the upcoming \" unsecure\" browser will allow for banking and other non anonymous stuff too.

I find it ironic that a browser labelled \"Unsafe\" is suggested as a good solution for Internet banking :). Seriously, though, it is probably true that malicious exit nodes makes banking less secure while using Tor. But why trust that your Internet connection isn't compromised in another way (DNS cache poisoning hitting your ISP, a local attacker on the public wireless network doing ARP spooging, etc.)?

No matter how you access your Internet bank (or buy stuff with a credit card, or deal with money in any other kind of way), I suggest that you always check the SSL certificate's fingerprint before you give up any revealing information (this implies only using banks/shops that employs HTTPS). To get the fingerprint, call your bank (or the shop owner). This makes it impossible for an attacker to mount any type of Man-in-the-middle attack unless the attacker also MitMs the above mentioned phone call :).

> [...] there is no point using TOR for anything personally identifiable, in fact it's probably a very bad idea. 

That is not correct. See mike's excellent point in the comment labelled \"To build on previous messages\".

> Forgetting to set a password for root or not setting one then needing it later can be quite annoying and makes the logging in more of a chore as I always end up debating whether I need it or not for a while each time I log in.

This, as well as all other Tails greeter options, will be possible to store inside the persistent storage in a future version of Tails.

> I'm currently experimenting with making TOR and vidalia config files persistent to speed up the connection time which can be really slow - if anyone has any tips or advice please share...? (what and whatnot to do).

I suggest that you do not do this as some of our scripts depend on that Tor's data directory is **not** persistent. This is already a [[planned feature|todo/persistence_preset_-_tor]] so you'll get it eventually.
