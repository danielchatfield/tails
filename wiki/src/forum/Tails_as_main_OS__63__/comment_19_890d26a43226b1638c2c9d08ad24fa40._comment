Long story: [[todo/Flash_support]]. Short story: **secure** flash support isn't easy.

I suppose you meant 15 cause I wrote 16 :).

This only pushes the authentification issue one step further: now you need to authenticate the *PGP signing key* of the bank. You can do that by, for instance, telephoning them and asking for its fingerprint. :) Any way, the approach of manually verifying SSL certificates doesn't scale. It may work for a few sites that you use occasionally (like your bank) but using for every SSL-enabled service is a guarantee for insantiy. Serious users may want to look into [Monkeysphere](http://web.monkeysphere.info/) ([[already in Tails|todo/monkeysphere]]) and [Convergence](http://convergence.io/) ([may be included at some point](https://tails.boum.org/todo/iceweasel_addon_-_Convergence/)).

We have some suggestions on how you can establish a trust path to our signing key: [[doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key]]
