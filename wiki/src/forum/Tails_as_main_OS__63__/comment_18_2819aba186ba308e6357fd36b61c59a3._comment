Author of #16 here,

Thank you for the reply.

Regarding obtaining SSL certificate fingerprints, wouldn't properly encrypted, signed email (GPG or PGP) be just as reliable as telephone?

I would think this is the only way for one to obtain said data for boum.org (Unless someone is lucky enough to know a TAILS dev or someone else involved with boum. org )
