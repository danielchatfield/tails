Doesn't TOR recommend right from the start to use end to end encription? 

comment 2
if the ssl fails then using tor would make you more vulnerable. hopefully the upcoming \" unsecure\" browser will allow for banking and other non anonymous stuff too.

How exactly would ssl fail? could you explain please
