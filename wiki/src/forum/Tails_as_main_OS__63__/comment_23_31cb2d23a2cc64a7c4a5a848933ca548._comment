I did not mean to suggest that \"Tails\" had actually suggested that one should obtain the phone number from the web site. And perhaps I should have figured that \"Tails\" simply took it as a given of common sense not to do that and therefore didn't see it necessary to explicitly warn against it. 

Nonetheless, the suggestion given in the quote I had posted (to have the representative one has called be the one to read the fingerprint out loud to you first) seems like it could only be positive, so I wanted to share it.

So then you do not bank at all online, I presume?

What about merely [i]shopping[/i]? 

I would think the risk for merely shopping online with a credit card is significantly lower than banking or anything involving submitting something as sensitive as a social security number that makes one vulnerable to **identity theft**. As I understand it, in most cases at least, if a credit card account becomes compromised, it can be stopped with minimal to no loss on the part of the holder.
