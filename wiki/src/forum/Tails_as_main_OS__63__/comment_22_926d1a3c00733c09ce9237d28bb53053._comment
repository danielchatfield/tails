>...that \"Tails\" did not seem to think of or account for this case of an attacker simply changing the phone number on a site.

From where did you get this idea of *\"Tails\" advocating obtaining the bank's phone number from a website*? I can't see it in any posts. Surely at the very least you'd use a number printed on a card, statement, etc? 

Personally, if I was freaked out about someone trying to MiTM my online banking, I'd drop in and ask the branch manager to print the fingerprint out for me... after phoning in advance to make an appointment (and thus giving him/her fair opportunity to figure out the correct procedure before I arrived) of course ;-)

Not that rogue CAs are the only hole in the SSL house of cards of course. My previous paragraph was hypothetical because I don't consider SSL fit for anything serious - whether with a verified cert or not.
