I just hope everyone realizes (and I trust \"Tails\" will object if he/she disagrees) that *the Tails browser is not a security panacea*.  Tails will not solve all the problems with SSL, browsers, computer security with which most of us are vaguely familiar.  Tails *can* help to provide *anonymity*, which does require providing enhanced *security* for certain activities.  But mixing anonymous and non-anonymous activities strikes me as a recipe for disaster, at least as far as maintaining anonymity goes, and possibly for security too if people think that Tails is \"secure\" in some absolute, boot-and-forget sense.
