> In a second scenario, on some other unknown network (which could be poisened) then using TOR should protect you from the network unless TOR specific attacks were in place (please correct me if I'm wrong). In this context, if I'm not mistaken, then using TOR would actually be advantageous.

That is correct. MitM:ing Tor is arguably harder (due to hard coded authority server certificate fingerprints in the Tor software, which you then have to authenticate) than MitM:ing HTTPS with the CA trust model (which repeatedly has been proven severely broken).

With that assumption, sure. Mike was referring to the fact that even when dealing with nominative data, Tor will hide your geographical location, which can be all that you really need in some circumstances (e.g. abuse victim on the run).

> (besides problems relating to your ISP - as I see it, there is no reason that a random TOR exit node will be safer than your ISP and I believe that the opposite is in fact true).

This depends greatly on which country you live in, but that's beside the point. What I was tryint to say in comment 12 was not that you should trust any random Tor exit node more than your ISP, but that you should *trust neither of them* by using authenticated end-to-end encryption (e.g. HTTPS + manual certificate fingerprint verification).

Note that with \"*trust*\" I'm not simply referring to \"*trust that X is not malicious*\", but also \"*trust that X is competent enought to keep malicious intruders off their networks etc.*\" Why gamble when you have in your hands the power to authenticate your destination in such a way that you don't have to trust any infrastructure in between?

> I would assume that a private VPN would be the safest bet but perhaps less practical than TOR as it's already implemented in TAILS.

And now we get back to the same point: why trust the VPN provider? :)
