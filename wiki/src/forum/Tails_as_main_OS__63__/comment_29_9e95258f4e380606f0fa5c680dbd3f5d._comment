Coming back to an interesting (on-topic?) point raised above: due to the horrid mess with CAs which have repeatedly proven unable to use their powers responsibly, using Tor for on-line banking might have some advantages purely from the perspective of security of SSL (or rather TLS).  

My initial response was that if customers use Tor to connect to their banks, the banks will encounter even greater difficulties in telling the real customer from a bank-theft imposter than they do already, driving up costs due to increased false positive alerts in the banks security system.  (The customer would quickly notice one undesirable unintended consequence, when his account is locked!)  However, I concede that *if* banks could only be persuaded to adopt the complex but robust model of PGP/GPG authentication using key exchange, perhaps it really could be safer to do on-line banking over Tor circuits.  The idea is that customer when the customer visits his bank to open an account, he shares his special purpose banking-only PGP/GPG public key, which he has previously generated on a \"trusted\" computer he owns, while off-line, along with a revocation certificate which he stores in a very safe place.  Thereafter he stores his PGP/GPG keyring as securely as possible consistent with regularly using it.  If he thinks it may have been compromised he sends the bank a revocation, and revisits in person to share his new key.

I think this is more of a political/economic obstacle than a technical obstacle.  I have a hunch the average bank officer has at best only a hazy appreciation of public-key cryptography (despite its many applications in the world of finance) and would be unable/unwilling to innovate.  Particularly since very few customers (probably) would be able to follow proper cryptographic discipline for PGP/GPG.
