Call the technical support and they (or someone they can connect you to) will know. At least that never failed me.

They were real deal according to the CA trust model, yes, so your browser wouldn't have complained if you visited any of the affected sites (unless you had some intelligent addon/plugin like monkeysphere or convergence installed). The key thing is that the certificates were *different* from the previous ones, and hence their fingerprint was also different. So if you knew the good fingerprint you'd immediately see that something isn't right when trying to verify it.
