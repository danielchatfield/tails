OP here, (also author of comment 2). Yes, there is no point using TOR for anything personally identifiable, in fact it's probably a very bad idea. That doesn't mean that people might not want to use Tails for non anonymous stuff though (I certainly do). But as everyone here is saying, you should keep the anonymous and the regular browsing completely seperate (reboot in between to be safe and avoid using persistence when bypassing TOR) - it's not even an option yet in TAILS 0.11 so we are getting ahead of ourselves a little here anyway.

I don't do banking online much, but I do look forward to TAILS having an unsecure broswer for the occasional non anonymous stuff that crops up everynow and then - it's not really 100% practical without it.

However, I have used Tails almost exclusively this week and frankly it's going well.


- TOR is not slow - I have downloaded several files at speeds varying between 0.2 - 1mb/s which is better than I expected. Opening lots of different web pages does lag a little though.

- The greeter is a little frustrating after a while - it would be much better to just be able to start typing my encryption key and then hit enter to get straight into Tails (without needing to click on anything at all). The current system seems clunky. Also, check boxes that can be reached and activated by hitting the tab key followed by the enter key would be a welcomed addition (for readonly, root and eventually macchanger).

- Forgetting to set a password for root or not setting one then needing it later can be quite annoying and makes the logging in more of a chore as I always end up debating whether I need it or not for a while each time I log in.

- Tails is not slow, but it pushes my weak computer to its limits and the result is a little slower than other debian live's I have tried.

- There is lots of attention to detail, TAILS feels like a very comprehensive package.

- html5 and youtube is shit - still need to find a simple way around this... (mp4 plugin and mobile site maybe?... I don't know)

- I'm currently experimenting with making TOR and vidalia config files persistent to speed up the connection time which can be really slow - if anyone has any tips or advice please share...? (what and whatnot to do).


Apart from that, I'm looking forward to enhanced default persistent features (like bookmarks), the new unsecured browser as well as 1 or 2 minor improvements set down in the development plan (simple macchanger implementation and apparmor for instance).


OH, and thanks to the Tails dev's and to anyone helping on this forum!
