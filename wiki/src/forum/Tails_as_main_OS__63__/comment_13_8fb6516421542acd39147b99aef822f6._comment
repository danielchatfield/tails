*\"I find it ironic that a browser labelled \"Unsafe\" is suggested as a good solution for Internet banking :)\"*

me too, but it made sense calling it \"unsafe\" in the context of anonymity so thought that might as well stick with that seeing as it's the primary function of Tails and is reffered as such in forum threads and todo documentation.

*\"But why trust that your Internet connection isn't compromised in another way (DNS cache poisoning hitting your ISP, a local attacker on the public wireless network doing ARP spooging, etc.)?\"*

On my home network which has dynamic IP and which is locked down I would place a lot of trust. If there were any issues with banking etc. I don't think that I would be held personally responsible. Using TOR and suffering issues might be a more of a grey area though and so in this situation, I would think that using TOR could be an unecessary liability.

In a second scenario, on some other unknown network (which could be poisened) then using TOR should protect you from the network unless TOR specific attacks were in place (please correct me if I'm wrong). In this context, if I'm not mistaken, then using TOR would actually be advantageous.

*\" That is not correct. See mike's excellent point in the comment labelled \"To build on previous messages\".*

I'm certainly not as qualified as Tails devs or probably Mike but I can't see the logic here. Assuming the previous example of a secure home network, I think that it would be better for banks/facebook to see your real IP and thus location. If your IP is jumping around the globe it's likely that your accounts will be frozen. Also with lots of strange activity logged to your account, in the eventuality of someone actually compromizing your accounts, unautorized access may be less noticeable when compared to your colorful history.

In this sense, in the eyes of the services you connect to, your physical IP is an important aspect of proving who you are (as well as *where* you are of course) - using TOR breaks this. An offshoot may also be that using TOR will somehow increase your liability in the event of a compromized account. Banks usually require end to end encryption so if you fuck with that (whether or not there is technically end to end encryption) you may put yourself in harder place to argue from. I still don't see any benefit of using TOR for non anonymous stuff when connected to a trustworthy network but I would be grateful for any examples that show the contrary (besides problems relating to your ISP - as I see it, there is no reason that a random TOR exit node will be safer than your ISP and I believe that the opposite is in fact true).

In the second case scenario (unsecured foreign network) then I must admit I hadn't considered that using TOR might be beneficial as this scenario doesn't really apply to my personal usage (do my banking from home and no need to login for anything else when out of the house). Honestly I don't know enough to comment, but I will look into it... I would assume that a private VPN would be the safest bet but perhaps less practical than TOR as it's already implemented in TAILS.

*\"This, as well as all other Tails greeter options, will be possible to store inside the persistent storage in a future version of Tails.\"*

sounds great - for a first release version, the greeter and persistency functions are already pretty good so I'm really looking forward to future enhancements.

*\"I suggest that you do not do this as some of our scripts depend on that Tor's data directory is not persistent. This is already a ?planned feature so you'll get it eventually.\"*

I did see that afterwards and added a note to the \"custom persistence thread\" but thanks!

And also thankyou for taking the time to write such a comprehensive reply!
