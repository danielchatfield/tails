[ClickToPlugin](http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/) is a **Safari** extension that allow to [repace Flash video by an HTML5 player](http://hoyois.github.com/safariextensions/clicktoplugin/killers.xhtml) in a bunch of websites. 

Perhaps is it possible to adapt this plugin to Iceweasel.

I tried to add it to the [[Flash support page|/todo/Flash_support]], but I received a warning (6 links!?) from blogspam..
