> anyone know how to close down a frozen program? Whats teh linux equivalent of task manager? 

You can have a look to `killall`.

You need to setup an administration password, then, when claws freezes:
(short version)

- Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch to a terminal console
- sudo -i
- enter your password
- killall -9 claws-mail
- Ctrl+Alt+F7

Good Luck!
