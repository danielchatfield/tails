It seems the hard work and dedication of incognito has left TAILS with a grand legacy. It is a fine achievement, free drinks and three cheers to all the Incognito developers. Let nobody forget (Including current TAILS developers) that TAILS is a collaborative effort, relying upon the support and patronage of others.

Although the exact reasons may be debated one thing is clear, TAILS stands to be sole patron of the mighty emperor TOR. Through the open doors of the emperor's palace (www.torproject.org) will flow the proceeds of the empire and all its glory. 

All crap aside Tails kicks ass, but even if it didn't it will always be the most used distribution while TOR supports it.

 TAILS should  honor the legacy of support provided by incognito by likewise helping the development of other distributions. The flow of patronage from TOR can be distributed with an open door on the main page of TAILS to the other deserving websites listed
