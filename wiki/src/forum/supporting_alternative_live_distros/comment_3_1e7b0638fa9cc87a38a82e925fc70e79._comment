hahaha  sounds like they were a political force to be reckoned with. I think tails can do without a page on women's rights but its funny all the same. Yes I can see the Debian connection and perhaps this only strengthens the argument for promoting  other  privacy software like  Debian Privatix. I don't think there is any harm supporting the efforts of these groups with a link on the main page. The  objective of Tails should be to promote privacy and free speech on the internet.  I can't see a better way to do that than making sure everyone can choose the most suitable software for their needs
