how to force HTTPS-Everywhere to only accept https connections or/and ask me if i want to connect n case its a regular https?
i dont care if the solution comes from HTTPS-Everywhere or a browser-setting itself...

i know this forum is Tails related but since its a tool used in Tails and the firewall is also a part which may act as a part here im going to ask here...
all the best!
