After I finish a Tails session and shutdown my computer, is it okay for me to boot to Windows and use a regular browser? Would this compromise my anonymity in any way? Would it perhaps be better for me to unplug my modem and plug it back again before using the internet with Windows?

On a related note, is it necessary to keep your regular HTTP/HTTPS browsing activities and your Hidden Service (as a user) activities separate?
