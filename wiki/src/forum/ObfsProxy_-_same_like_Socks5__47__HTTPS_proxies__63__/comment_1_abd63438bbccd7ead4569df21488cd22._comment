The Obfsproxy bridges behave more like Tor nodes and replace the first node of the three a normal connection would have... therefore reducing your circuit diversity.

I agree that Obfsproxy would be extremely useful, probably best not enabled by default in the Tails torrc but available for those who *need* it. However it's simply not an option until Tails moved to the 0.2.3 branch of Tor.
