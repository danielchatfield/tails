sorry, the formatting on this forum is strange, each entry like this:

net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1 net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1 

should not be on the same line, but each new specification should be on it's own line! Google other sysctl.conf file configurations to see the proper formatting since it didn't paste here correctly. Also, the large text lines should contain a shift+3 commentted start or you'll receive errors.
