>What is the SHA256?

Oh FFS! Don't pester strangers on an anonymous website... calculate it yourself! That way you'll **know** the sum you get is correct!

    sha256sum tails-i386-0.16~rc1.iso

@ Comment 1. Don't encourage this crap! What you've posted is **worthless**

>Does the new homepage check if Tor is running like check.torproject.org does? 

Nope

>Because I then have to do that because of the rare occasion when there is a warning \"You are not using Tor.\"

This hasn't happened to you ***in Tails***, has it.

>Will we get a spell check soon because misspellings can, after time, out us?

You can add one any time you like - in whichever dialect(s) of whichever language(s) you want.
