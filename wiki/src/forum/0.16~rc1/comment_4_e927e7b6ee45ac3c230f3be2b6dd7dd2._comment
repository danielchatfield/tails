Answers to OP:

1. A digital signature is provided on the same page you can get the download. Use that with `gpg` to verify the integrity of the download instead (for example from within an already verified and running Tails).

2. No, that message didn't serve any purpose in Tails as Tails browser will not work unless the connections is made securely through Tor, and that message sometimes incorrectly states Tor is not in use, which scares users. (TorBrowserBundle is also planning on ditching it for same reasons)

3. Some of the supported languages in Tails is getting spell checks soon, according to Tails source code repository.
