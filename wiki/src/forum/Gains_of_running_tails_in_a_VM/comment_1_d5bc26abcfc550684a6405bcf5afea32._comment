I don't think their are advantages in running Tails inside a VM from a security point of view. But there are [[drawbacks|/doc/advanced_topics/virtualization]]. Nonetheless, it has some advantages on a usability point of view. For example, we use it a lot for testing.

Other distros take advantage of virtual machines from a security point of view. See [Whonix]. But that's a different project.
