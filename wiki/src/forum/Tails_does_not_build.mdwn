Hi Tails community,

Tails fails to build.
In the following, the steps I did:

git clone git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
cd amnesia
git checkout devel

lb clean --all && lb config && lb build

The output has been:


The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 linux-image-2.6-486 : Depends: linux-image-486 but it is not going to be installed
 plymouth : PreDepends: multiarch-support but it is not installable

I thought it's due to some changes in Debian repositories. Is it correct ? Do you have any suggestion to resolve ?

Thank you
