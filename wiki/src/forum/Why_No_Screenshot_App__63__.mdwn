Why is no screenshot app included in TAILS?

Not even the basic one that is part of the Gnome desktop environment.

I saw in another thread where someone said that the GIMP could be used to take screenshots. But using something as elaborate and heavy as GIMP just to take a simple screenshot seems like using a sledgehammer to kill a fly (to use a very old metaphor).

I would think that many of the type of people for whom TAILS is most useful would also be among those most likely to have a real need for taking screenshots to use as evidence.
