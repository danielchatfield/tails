> But the need to change your password,

What password needs to be changed?

> MAC is nowhere described well, ideally at desktop need a program with one button to do so.

It's [[on top of our TODO list|todo/macchanger]. Help is welcome.

>  But the top - it's firewall. By default, all ports are closed, although the logic of a \"LiveCD\" is designed to work out of the box. MAN absent. Result - the user has registered ETh0, was unable to run TOR server, for the sane time, did not find the information and threw the disc in the trash.

No modification to the Tails firewall is needed to use Tails.
What makes you think things are different?
