hello

i've got an issue trying to verify iso (downloaded
through torrent) giving me a bad signature everytime i've tried
i've tried also to download several instances of tails signing key (wich are the same) and iso signing key (no differences)
could it be possible to get a checksum of the iso to have an evidence this iso is or is not to download one more time ? my connexion is weak... thanks

in case torrent is corrupted is it a choice of several downlod locations for direct download ?

thanks again
