Following the instruction here:

https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#verify

When I import the Tails signing key, rather than say "imported" it returns "27 new signatures". Is this okay?


Here it is in full:

cat tails-signing.key | gpg --import

gpg: key BE2CD9C1: "Tails developers (signing key) <tails@boum.org>" 27 new signatures
gpg: Total number processed: 1

gpg:         new signatures: 27

gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
