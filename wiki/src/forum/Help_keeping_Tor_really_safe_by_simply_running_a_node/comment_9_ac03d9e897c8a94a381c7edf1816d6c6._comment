You probably meant \"not able to surf\".

I sometimes find that Javascript really is neccessary for some transaction, and if I am using a DVD I sometimes momentarily re-enable it in the Tails browser menu.

But to a great extent I find that disabling Javascript not only immunizes me from all kinds of attacks but speeds up my tor browsing, while not causing significant problems.  It might take a day or so for most users to adapt to browsing with Javascript disabled.
