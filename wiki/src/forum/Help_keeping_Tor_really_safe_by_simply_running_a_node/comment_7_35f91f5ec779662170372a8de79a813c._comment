Tails (and TBB) use the Vidalia Tor controller, which already has a very easy one or two click option to run a relay (middle Tor node) when you browse with Tor.  Try clicking on green onion icon, then \"Settings\", then \"Sharing\", then \"Relay traffic inside the Tor network\".

Please note that if you are yourself connecting via a Bridge for additional anonymity/security, you cannot use this option.  If you are using Entry Guards instead, you can use it, but your IP will neccessarily become public knowledge as someone running a Tor relay.  This has apparently not yet resulted in any legal problems (quite unlike running a Tor exit, unfortunately).

I would be interested in any hints from the Tor developers about whether there is any benefit to either the Tor Project or to our own anonymity from running a relay if we have only 200 Kb/sec bandwidth.

By the way, if you have limited bandwidth, simply disabling Javascript is likely to greatly increase your own browsing speeds, because your browser won't waste time trying to load all the crud that advertisers try to push out, often from a third party server (which leads to additional delays while your browser attempts to locate and load javascript or images from the third party servers).
