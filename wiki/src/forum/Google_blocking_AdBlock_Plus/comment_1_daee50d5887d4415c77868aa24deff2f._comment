> Because Tails does not use Android or Chrome, this issue apparently does not directly affect Tails users.

Some might even say it's not even remotely related to Tails, and those people would be right, as this news article is about something only affecting android and nothing else.

Also your title, and the article you link to for that matter is misleading, google is not intentionally blocking ad-block plus, they added a security improvement to Android that broke ad-blocks funcvtionality on a unrooted android system. 

I'd like to see you argue that allowing any standard application running on android to intercept and redirect all of your web traffic to a custom proxie is not something that should be considered a big security threat, because it is, and it is actually about time that google came around to removeing that security fault.
