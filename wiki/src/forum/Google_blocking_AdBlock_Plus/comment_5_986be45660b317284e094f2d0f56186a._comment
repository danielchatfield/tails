> Briefly, my concern is that surveillance and disruption efforts by Google (and some other companies which are virtually omnipresent on the internet, or at least on the Tor network) will adversely affect Tails users. These are not limited to Android specific measures, and they do affect everyone who surfs the net. I plan to try to explain further in the near future.

And you are perfectly free to believe that and be concerned by it, but I personally don't really see the story you linked to as actually being a bad thing or as an indication of bad things to come and I don't feel this is anywhere near Tails related enough that it warrants a discussion on this forum.

we are both entitled to our opinion so I won't claim that I'm right on this issue, but the Tails developers have made it pretty clear they do not want topics like this in this forum, because as you even said yourself, this isn't really directly connected to Tails, and the Tails developers have made it pretty clear lately that they only wish topics on this forum that is in fact directly and exclusively connected to Tails itself.
