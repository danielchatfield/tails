You are missing the point.  As is so often the case here, the reason is that you are focusing on technical aspects whereas I am focusing on programs which use various technical means to accomplish similar aims, not all of which are by any means good for the average citizen.

Briefly, my concern is that surveillance and disruption efforts by Google (and some other companies which are virtually omnipresent on the internet, or at least on the Tor network) will adversely affect Tails users.  These are not limited to Android specific measures, and they *do* affect everyone who surfs the net.  I plan to try to explain further in the near future.
