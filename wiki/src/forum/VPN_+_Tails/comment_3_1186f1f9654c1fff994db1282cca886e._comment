Thanks Tails Devs!  It is the exit node that I am afraid of because anyone can set one up.  Let's say I want to check the SSL certficiate of the U.S.'s largest bank, BOA, using Tails and without installing any other software of addons, how do you recommend checking this?  When I have their fingerprint from the phone call, where do I compare that with the one the https web page is providing me with?
