Why do you not trust Tails for this? Do you mean that you do not trust Tor's exit nodes? If so, good. You can protect yourself from exit nodes (e.g. [Man-in-the-middle attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) by always checking your bank's SSL certificate's fingerprint before you login. To get the fingerprint, call your bank.
