> Tails is about creating a live Linux distribution. What would be your ways of doing things?

Almost any other live distribution, except for the most simplistic, goes much further than taking a given distribution (Debian) as-is, and tweaking its settings. You call it “upstream integration” etc., I call it inability to do serious work.

> What proofs do you need?

Who talks about proof? You never even list current developers and their education / expertise anywhere, always using weasel words in order to refer to mailing lists and IRC whenever such questions come up.

> We do not have to submit anything to the Tor project. Those reports are meant to keep the community informed about what is happening within Tails. Yeah, we simply like to be open about what we do...

You are only open about the developed features. You are closed about everything else, including funding.

> Sorry but you are wrong. We do not wish to disclose the name of our sponsors until we reach an agreement with them. We are not going to advertise those who are not going to support us!

Referring to advertisement must be the silliest point in your post. Do you deny having applied to EIDHR? Do you deny that such funding is questionable, and might influence support for your project from other sources?

> The Tor project is likely to have a budget of $2M by the end of 2012. $10K is 0.5% of that, and only covers some hardware, hosting fees and travel for developers meetings. Not much regarding to the amount of time and attention that Tails requires.

This doesn't address my point in any way. You do not disclose any funding anywhere. You do not list what it is used for. Your case is the usual case where large sums of money, received by large organizations, sieve down to questionable causes. Was the developer meeting advertised anywhere before sums of money were spent on it? Are granted sums listed anywhere? Was there any application process for travel? Were there alternative causes to spend the money on? These are rhetorical questions.

> If you do not trust current Tails developers, feel free to start your own project.

What is the reason that Tails is supported by Tor? Is such support warranted by actual merit, or shmoozing in various venues? All evidence points to the latter.
