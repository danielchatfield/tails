> You \"guess\", wrongly, but still seem to take this guesses like the only truth others should believe. But these are guesses without much informations, and that's all

1. You applied for funding from EIDHR. This shows that you have no principles.

2. You wasted money donated to Tor on a meeting of all developers. Who oversaw who gets to go to the meeting? If I shmooze with you on IRC, and get called a “developer” without producing anything useful, do I also get to go to vacations at the expense of donated money?

3. You try to hide your funding sources and ignore requests for detailing spendings.

4. You never answer how the Tor project came to support Tails. It appears that such support is not based on merit, but on shmoozing, and hence any credibility by association of the project is in question.

> Yes, most of us want to stay anonymous while developing Tails, for a variety of reasons. We won't disclose you anything, trying to force us like this is just losing your time.

5. You are pretending that the requests are for deanonymization, yet they are for disclosing your knowledge and experience. It is obvious that you don't want to disclose anything, but it is also obvious that the reason for that is lack of knowledge or experience, and desire to keep the project's bureaucracy as non-transparent as possible.

> Specially if you behave this way like a teenager.

I am sorry, did you just write the following: “Just to prove to your superior geeky mind you're wrong\", and “You should really spend time to have a life rather than losing it being so sure about yourself”. Such statements reek of anti-intellectual teenage rage so popular in certain anti-intellectual countries, where you apparently come from.
