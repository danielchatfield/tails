After looking over this thread, the conspicuous argumenta ad hominem appear to have been directed *by* the \"troll\" *at* \"the developers\". Lots of accusations of \"schmoozing\" and \"no principles\" and all manner of apparently baseless personal attacks. Shows how silly and subjective these thing are I suppose.
