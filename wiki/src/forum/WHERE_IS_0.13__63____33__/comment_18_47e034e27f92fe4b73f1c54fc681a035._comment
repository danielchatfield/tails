> Once again you seem to know more than us on ourselves, and at the same time complain not to know us. What could I say more?

You could stop pretending not to understand what's written, as other comments above. I know what you produce, but I don't know anything else about you — I can only guess, since you consistently refuse to provide any information on the subject.

> But so far none of your question convinced us you knew what you were talking about, sorry.

That's why I added links, so that you can't pretend that my points are purely subjective. You only show that you don't want to answer the questions — which is fine, but don't pretend it is anything else.

> So, as we don't force you to use Tails, please fork to show us how allmighty you surely are, or use another OS, but please stop asserting things without the very beginning of an idea of what or who you're talking about, as you showed us until know.

There is no reason to get angry like that. Not having the necessary expertise to develop a project is not a fault, but the users should be aware of the issue. Saying “shut up or fork” is shifting the subject from the real problem — lack of expertise and misappropriation of funds.
