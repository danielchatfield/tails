Thanks for your support. Yes, we won't reply to this guy anymore, as you said, it's clear he isn't around for any constructive debate.

You should also stop replying him by the way, that's the better path for everyone here :-)

> I wish tails had not said that. That said, it is very hard to face a troll with a cool head, please tails devs don't feed it anymore.

Sure it was a hard reply, but this guy seems to have such a strong opinion of himself it has to be pointed out. Even if seems unable to hear anything from anyone.

Thanks again for your support, let's just ignore this troll, he will get tired at some point :-)
