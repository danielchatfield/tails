\"I would rather they produce a high-quality product.\"

Good luck :

- still no real irc client (pidgin for irc is crap)
- probably another old version of network manager
- possible outdated Iceweasel ESR with security probs
- still no real clipboard except for the stupid forced
  encryption keyboard which is crappy for those who don't
  need clipboard encryption
- stupid cookies extension, which shouldn't be needed
  when torbutton handles cookies
- mysterious 'user count' whenever you connect to the net
  with Tails, somehow (which I have yet to hear about
  how and which files so I can disable this 'feature')
  it sees you have booted Tails and contributed to the
  expanding user base tally

and more
