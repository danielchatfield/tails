> The delay is perfectly understandable due to the new security release of Tor, but it is annoying to check everyday to see if it is finally released. Could the developers perhaps come up with a new date? Even if it is only indicative it is ok, but this wait is just frustrating. Perhaps in the news section?

We were waiting for [Iceweasel 10.0.7esr-2 to be available](https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports-changes/2012/09/msg00172.html). We had no date to communicate because we were waiting on a reply from the maintainer. Now that the package is here, [[we are moving forward|contribute/release_process]] and manually undertaking the [[long test suite|contribute/release_process/test]].
