\"pretending not to understand the difference between amateur developers and those possessing some background\"

Tails development is requiring sysadmin skills on top of others like coding. Why should we answer such misplaced question when they show you don't understand yourself the ecosystem you're talking about? Are you here only to spread FUD? You whin not to know us, but yet you seems to have strong opinions about our abilities. Dunno what's your trick, appart from willing to create meaningless conflicts.

We already spent too much time answering you, we have to work on the new release. Unless you spent a bit more time thinking about it and reading a bit more of our website and other documentation before asking more meaningful questions, we don't have the time nor reasons to answer silly assertions based on empty assumptions. They only reveals either your misunderstanding or your willingness to FUD.
