\"You have neither system administration, nor coding skills.\"

Once again you seem to know more than us on ourselves, and at the same time complain not to know us. What could I say more?

\"Stop referring to valid points as FUD\"

\"Valid point\" is a subjective idea, you know? I guess in your superior mind, your assumptions can't be wrong because you are so smart.

But so far none of your question convinced us you knew what you were talking about, sorry.

So, as we don't force you to use Tails, please fork to show us how allmighty you surely are, or use another OS, but please stop asserting things without the very beginning of an idea of what or who you're talking about, as you showed us until know.
