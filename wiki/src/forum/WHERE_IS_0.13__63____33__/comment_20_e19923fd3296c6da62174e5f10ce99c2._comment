\"I can only guess\"

Yeah, that's the point! You \"guess\", wrongly, but still seem to take this guesses like the only truth others should believe. But these are guesses without much informations, and that's all

\"That's why I added links\"

And we replied pointing to you that your links and guesses were wrong.

\"Not having the necessary expertise to develop a project\"

Proof that while you say you're guessing you're still asserting things on top of that is in this phrase. Like it's the only true vision. I'm just angry to read so silly and twisted \"debate\", and of your behavior. You bring nothing to assert your position. Or is there a functionnal problem with the project?

Yes, most of us want to stay anonymous while developing Tails, for a variety of reasons. We won't disclose you anything, trying to force us like this is just losing your time. Specially if you behave this way like a teenager.
