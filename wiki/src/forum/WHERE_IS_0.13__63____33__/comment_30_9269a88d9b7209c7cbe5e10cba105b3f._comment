I think Tails can do better in its replies. Stick to facts, don't get emotional, link of topic comments to a new blog page. I for one am very interested in the topic of Funding. No body can possibly claim to be independent without publishing its funding source. Its basic. Is there another blog on this subject, please  link if there is or i will start a new topic

>let's just ignore this troll, he will get tired at some point :-)

Did I read properly? Did TAILS just call someone a troll? 

Well I have been willing to give TAILS the benefit of the doubt as to being professional, but often I wonder. 

Its not just about fact A or B its about trust. Not just do I trust that TAILS doesn't have a backdoor but do I trust that TAILS are competent.

If I went to a software development seminar where the speaker started talking about \"Trolls\" I would laugh and walk out

 I would suggest everyone have a look at the liberte forum

I don't know if its better or worse though I can say that I haven't heard of anyone referred to as Trolls there
