Please Tails developers,

You clearly have the ability to produce a great OS, but even you cannot beat a troll at it's own game. With all due respect, you have already said enough to demonstrate the nature of this poster to the tails community, now you are letting this educated troll (probably the same who has been harassing this forum with other tactics) drag you into a pointless flame war.

Take the trolls last post:

\"You applied for funding from EIDHR. This shows that you have no principles.\"

It starts with truth and progresses to arrive at an \"obvious\" conclusion without basis. What are it's reasons for distrusting EIDHR? I believe it previously stated something as promoting european interests in the world. Yet when I went to it's site I saw EIDHR helps worthy projects. 

\"You wasted money donated to Tor on a meeting of all developers. Who oversaw who gets to go to the meeting? If I shmooze with you on IRC, and get called a “developer” without producing anything useful, do I also get to go to vacations at the expense of donated money?\"

Rigth.. And presented a report from said meeting where many things got done.. Besides.. did the troll expect you to grow wing and fly on your own? Even you are not THAT awesome ;) Perhaps it expects you to preclude the benefits of working face to face and tails development progressing that much slower? Besides his indignation is appalling.. did it contribute the 10K or perhaps the 2 million to tor project and does not approve how it was spent? Greater Transparency is always a good thing but lets face it.. it is not his money..it was given to you by tor project, so don't let it bait you with it's atitude..

\"You try to hide your funding sources and ignore requests for detailing spendings.\"

Your points of not divulging supporters while still in process is a valid one. Detailed spending will hopefully come at a time when the tails project is more mature and established. Now there are greater concerns, such as software development which still is the main point I believe.

\"You never answer how the Tor project came to support Tails. It appears that such support is not based on merit, but on shmoozing, and hence any credibility by association of the project is in question.\"

So? if you feel the tor project trust is misplaced why don't you take the issue with them? oh rigth.. perhaps because they will tell you to mind your own business..they are nice.. I'd tell you to go troll other forums troll! Besides, if you clearly believe the tor project trust is misplaced, then perhaps their software is also dubious? feel free to distrust tor as well as tails while you are at it (although I guess I shouldn't say this as I'm not a dev..)

\"You are pretending that the requests are for deanonymization, yet they are for disclosing your knowledge and experience. It is obvious that you don't want to disclose anything, but it is also obvious that the reason for that is lack of knowledge or experience, and desire to keep \"the project's bureaucracy as non-transparent as possible.\"

In the tread the troll linked to there is a very good argument regarding accountability and unbiased trust based on the software itself. I for one was convinced. Thank you troll! without you I would not have found it.

\"I am sorry, did you just write the following: “Just to prove to your superior geeky mind you're wrong\", and “You should really spend time to have a life rather than losing it being so sure about yourself”. Such statements reek of anti-intellectual teenage rage so popular in certain anti-intellectual countries, where you apparently come from.\"

I wish tails had not said that. That said, it is very hard to face a troll with a cool head, please tails devs don't feed it anymore.

\"(six) You pretend to carefully consider consequences of all added features on users' anonymity, yet once it comes to a feature you really like to have (counting users with no way to opt-out), such research goes out of the window, and you simply add excuses after the fact. Again, you have no principles.\"

Tails has answered this satisfactorily so many times already that I feel that I am wasting my time...I LIKE TO BE WARNED IF MY TAILS IS OUTDATED TROLL!!IT IS A FEATURE, STOP PRETENDING IT IS NOT! TOR PROJECT DOES THE SAME THING WITH THE ARE YOU USING TOR? WEBPAGE!! (breathes...yes..maddening troll is maddening..)

This tread has IMHO opinion outlived it's usefullness, and thank you for answering my question and promptly releasing 0.13. (I'm commenter 1).

I would like also to apologize.. apparently I gave this troll a great idea with a previous comment of mine when I suggested the easiest way to attack tails probably was sowing FUD in this forum.
