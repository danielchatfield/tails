>Tails development is amateurish,..

No, not amateurish, *amateur*, full-on 100% pure *amateur*. Tails is an *amateur* project. There isn't a single professional Tails developer. Every one of them kindly *donates* their time to the project on a purely *voluntary* basis. If you want a *professional* OS, then you should be looking elsewhere - at Fedora, Ubuntu or Windows perhaps?

>..and consists mostly of tweaking Debian settings and installed software base.

...and never purports to be anything else. Are you suggesting there's something wrong with basing a distro on Debian? Perhaps you should share your wisdom with Ubuntu?

>I didn't yet see any evidence that any of the (by now, quite a few) Tails developers possess actual expertise in anonymity / cryptography or software development.

Then you haven't really looked have you? There's a *significant* and healthy sharing of expertise between Tails and related projects. Notably and significantly Tor and Debian.

>There was a thread about this topic, and the developers refused to disclose any details.

And why should they? This information isn't particularly difficult to come by if you're genuinely interested. In fact.. if you're *really* interested... *you* can even [become a Tails developer](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/index.en.html) yourself!

Can't comment any further as I haven't bothered to read any more of your little rant.
