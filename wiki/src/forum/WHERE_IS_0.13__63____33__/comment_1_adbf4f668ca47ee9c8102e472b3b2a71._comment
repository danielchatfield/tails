Quite true.
The delay is perfectly understandable due to the new security release of Tor, but it is annoying to check everyday to see if it is finally released.
Could the developers perhaps come up with a new date? Even if it is only indicative it is ok, but this wait is just frustrating.
Perhaps in the news section?
