Reading the thread, it sounds to me questions were answered. If you do not agree with them doesn't mean they weren't.

About the competence, what's the point? After all the best way to get ian idea is to watch the Tails project development. And other informations could potentially break their anonymity. If you feel it doesn't fit your needs, use another similar project. The fact that the Torproject advertise it is at least a proof that they believe Tails devs are making a good job enough. If really this project was as badly developed as you say, it would have been forked since a while, or no one would use it.

About the funding and \"principles\", do you seriously think they'll begin to say bad stuffs on funders, putting at risk not to get the money? What's the most important? That they get funds to go on the development? You can still get an idea of what goes into Tails and their priorities by having a look at their git history and their roadmap. All the development is open. What makes you think looking at these that it's influencing their development? And even if some funders are questionnable, in the end Tails is also helping people that are not the kind of targeted by this funders.

I guess that yourself have \"principles\", and then don't use Tor nor Tails nor a lot of FOSS projects. After all, Tor has been developed by the US Navy, and the project certainly have funders you could question the same way you are doing here. As a lot of other FOSS projects.
