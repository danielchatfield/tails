\"You struggle with the simplest issues, such as coding shell scripts (getopt- and torsocks-related posts on the mailing list \"

Just to prove to your superior geeky mind you're wrong, we weren't the one asking question on the mailing list on that topic. We actually did help someone and answered his question, sometimes with patches.
