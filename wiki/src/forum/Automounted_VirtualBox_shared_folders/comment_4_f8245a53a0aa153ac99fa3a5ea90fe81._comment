It works!!  Thank you, so much!  

Although I would give one caveat.  One of the ways to identify a user through a web browser is with screen resolution.  If you're really concerned about hiding your identity you might NOT want to use VBoxClient --display, especially if you're using a slightly non-standard resolution.
