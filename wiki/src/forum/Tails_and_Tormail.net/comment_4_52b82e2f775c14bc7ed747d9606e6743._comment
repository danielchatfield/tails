> problem with tormail is only that they don't let you to use strong password than only letters and numbers.

If they don't have a limit on the length of the password this is not an issue. Just use longer passwords. For instance, to get 128 bit entropy (~security) you need 43 **random** alphanumeric charachters, but with all printable characters allowed you still need 39 **random** characters. For 128 bits you need 22 and 20 **random** characters, respectively. As you can see the difference isn't that large.

That doesn't justify not allowing non-alphanumeric characters, though.
