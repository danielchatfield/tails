when you put CD in your PC and boot Tails/Amnesia, press TAB on keyboard and you will get possibility to change options for booting. in the end of parameters, you will see something like Time:America/Detroit, just delete America/Detroit and write there what you want, I write Europe/Berlin (even I am not in Berlin) and then my clock is as I need.
