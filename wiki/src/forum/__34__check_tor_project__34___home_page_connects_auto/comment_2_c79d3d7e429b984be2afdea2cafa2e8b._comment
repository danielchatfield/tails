A few typos there. My bad.

Whenever user opens a fresh iceweasel window, a connection to \"tor check\" is established. Thats the same address as the default home page set in Tails 17.1's iceweasel. 

This continues to happen even if user changes homepage to something else or even leave it blank.

You can test this by monitoring \"network map\" then trying to open iceweasel where you will find said connection check.torproject.org:443

This wasnt happening in 0.17 (previous version of Tails).

How can this be stopped and what is causing it?
