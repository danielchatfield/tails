I will try to rephrase:

1. open iceweasel

2. change iceweasel's homepage setting to anything you want other than the default or just leave it empty (I left it empty)

3. close iceweasel

4. open iceweasel again. This time watch Tor's network map as iceweasel starts. Iceweasel still connects to Tor project on start (the default homepage's address)
