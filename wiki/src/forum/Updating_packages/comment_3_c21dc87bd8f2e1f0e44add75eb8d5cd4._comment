1. Before updating packages, check Synaptic and make sure downloaded packages are retained after download and install.

2. Following the download of packages, you can save these to usb in its own directory

3. When you reboot, you can reinstall packages by making the usb directory with the packages a location in apt's sources list and refresh sources and apply, deselecting the remote sources listed so you only update from your local source.

4. You may continue to check for updates and copy them to the usb directory you created.
