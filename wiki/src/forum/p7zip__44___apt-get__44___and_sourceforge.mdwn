First question, is the apt-get function secured by tor when obtaining the package through command line?

p7zip doesnt seem to open any .7z files. ive tried 7z, 7za, and 7zr as well. 

finally, i've had no luck downloading sourceforge software while running through the live disc. this may have something to do with "your download will start shortly" code. Is there any way to resolve this? manually clicking the link doesnt help either. 

Thank you.
