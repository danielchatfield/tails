In some ways, CLI should be *easier* for the target userbase (in the era of Switchblade missiles and military \"kinetic engagement\" of on-line activists, we should probably avoid using the word \"target\" in such a way), because you can just write some lines and say \"paste these lines into your command shell\".  In contrast, I find that writing and following instructions for using a poorly designed GUI is often impossible.

Just a thought.
