This is Tails specific as is an attack on tails design through no fault of the implementation. Similar, I suppose, to what happened with the FireGPG and Javascript unfortunately.

Unlike FireGPG, Tails remains pretty useful, but this is an attack vector not accounted for and for the moment not even mitigated. Of course the devs have no shortage of problems to solve (unlike time) and this new attack only adds to that.

The solution does not reside in burying the head in the sand and pretending this is not a \"Tails specific problem\" however. This can be a threat to some Tails users especially activists. Imagine you are a Chinese blogger, for example.

 
@ Commenter 5  You should really stop mildly insulting other posters. Your comments and writing style are pretty much specific to you. You must be the smarta** (just to not accuse you with the T word if you just have a bad sense of humor) from comment 3 and 5 of *ttps://tails.boum.org/forum/Theme_in_tails/ (yes I posted comment 2,4,7 and 9 of that thread - first post on this though). 
I almost expect your thesis on forum daftness to be published one of these days. Then I will know your name but its ok as your writing style is not a tails specific topic right?
