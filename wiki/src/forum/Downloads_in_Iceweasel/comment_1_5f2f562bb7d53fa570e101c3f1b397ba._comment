Direct connections [[shouldn't be possible in Tails|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement]]. I can confirm that I have seen download speeds at 400 KiB/s or higher at some rare moments while using Tor, so it's not impossible. And I can confirm that at these times I've had to check whether something has gone wrong. :)

If it happens again, have a look in Vidalia and look at the circuit that's used for the download. If it consists of three high-bandwidth nodes, all should be ok.
