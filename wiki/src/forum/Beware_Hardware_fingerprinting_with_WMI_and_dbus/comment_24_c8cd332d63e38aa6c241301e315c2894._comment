I will try to develop an online website that will (using dbus or wmi) try to identify and fingerprint a specific PC using Tails over tor. After I obtain a hardware fingerprint I will see if I can identify the same PC again using a different OS over a standard non-tor internet connection. I will let you know what the results are.
