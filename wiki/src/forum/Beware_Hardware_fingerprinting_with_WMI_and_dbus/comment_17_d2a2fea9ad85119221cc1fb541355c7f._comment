You can use it to Query a server or Client using Java (see below).

WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a very powerful tool for anyone who runs their own server on a win32 platform. It can provide you with many pieces of information that you’d never thought possible. Beyond that you can even control almost every aspect of your system with WMI. Couple that with PHP and you’ll have the power to perform almost any type of action you’d like on your server.


AND A CLIENT FROM JAVA:

The jWMI class is a fairly simple class which allows an application to execute an arbitrary query against the WMI subsystem.  jWMI is easy to use and contains member variable defines for many of the available WMI classes.

Executing a WMI query via jWMI is simple, as can be seen in the following example:

String name = getWMIValue(\"Select Name from Win32_ComputerSystem\", \"Name\");

You can also query multiple data fields as shown in the following example. when querying multiple data fields from a class, be sure to place the field names in the same order as the query describes them. This will help avoid confusion.

String name = getWMIValue(\"Select Description, Manufacturer from Win32_PnPEntity\", \"Description,Manufacturer\");

As shown in a previous example, you can also execute more complex queries such as the following. In this case, we provide ‘Name’ as the desired field since we want the name of each service that is in a Stopped state:

String name = getWMIValue(\"Select * from Win32_Service WHERE State = 'Stopped'\", \"Name\");
