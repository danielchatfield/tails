Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Microsoft's implementation of the WBEM (Web Based Enterprise Management) standard from the Distributed Management Task Force. These standards are available and used in several flavors of *nix systems. Just as an example, here is a SourceForge project that enables WBEM on Linux systems. There is a standard called CIM (Common Information Model) which is described by the DTMF as follows:

    \"CIM provides a common definition of management information for systems, networks, applications and services, and allows for vendor extensions. CIM's common definitions enable vendors to exchange semantically rich management information between systems throughout the network.\"
