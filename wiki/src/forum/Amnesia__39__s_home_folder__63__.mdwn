Hi all just started using Tails via live cd and must say I am impressed. Just one thing I can't get a handle on though, the physical location of the Amnesia's Home folder on the desktop.
 When I temp download anything to this folder my cd drive goes nuts for a few seconds, same for when I delete anything from it, this makes me think that it is some kind of live directory on the cd! Is this the case? Or is it some kind of virtual folder in the ram? Or is it neither? Just hesitant about downloading anything to it if its not secure.
Many Thanks in advance.
