Thanks for this thread, it's exactly what I was looking for. I am having some issues and hope you can help me clear a few things up.

On the install it says I need to install other things to make the Mullvad install work.

1. python-wxgtk2.8

2. Open VPN

There are a few options for both of these and I'm unsure which one I should install.

Here is the Open VPN page: http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as-sw/113.html?osfamily=Ubuntu

Ant the Python page: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python-wxgtk2.8

And here is hte full message I got in case it's helpful: $ sudo dpkg -i /home/amnesia/mullvad_34_all.deb
[sudo] password for amnesia:
