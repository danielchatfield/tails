I don't really need Tor or Tails but started using it to get around Google spying. Now I try to waste the pigges time. If they spend time wondering what I'm doing, that is less time they can spend of investigating freedom fighters.

But I do have questions now and then. Though it is not necessary, when I get the other 500 words (the other half of the story since a picture is worth 1000 words and piggies only publiish their half) then I might take out my hard drive, remove meta data, and upoad the piggies in action using a service that is unusal and unsuspected as mine. Another way is to exchange thumb drives with someone whose online connection is not connected with mine. All drives are wiped after upload.

What if I leave tails running and go out to dinner? (Yes, the smart thing would be to shut it down, but please play along.) 

If the hard drive is still in the system could someone us the booted Tails to access it? If it is not booted in admin mode, could they reboot it and then access the hard drive, then reboot again to make it as before. If so, how could I tell that was ever done? IOW, maybe the Amnesic Incognito Live System also curtails evidence of tampering. This could be important to some people.
