Is it considered safe to install "gthumb" image viewer to Tails?

It's in the repos.

Unlike eye of Gnome, gthumb allows easy moving of images between folders, renaming and many other functions.

And is there any chance something like gthumb might be considered for inclusion in Tails?

Thanks a lot. 

All your work is much appreciated.
