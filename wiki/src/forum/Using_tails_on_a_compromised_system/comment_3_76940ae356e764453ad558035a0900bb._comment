Tails runs independently from your operating system and from what you describe, I understood that your computer has only been compromised by software: trojan, virus, etc. running from inside your operating system. In that case it should be equally safe to run Tails from a CD.

That would be totally different, in case you think your computer could have been compromised by hardware: someone having physical access to it and installing untrusted pieces of hardware on it.
