I got obscene stuff sent to people on my facebook and my characters in an mmorpg I play deleted. My PC also seems to crash at the strangest moments when I'm writing a paper in word. I'm pretty sure I have a trojan or at least a keylogger.

I have one PC and I can't format it right now so I'm wondering if Tails can give me security on a PC like this.

Thank You
