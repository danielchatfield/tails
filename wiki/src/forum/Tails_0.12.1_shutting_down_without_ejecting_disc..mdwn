Previous versions of Tails opened and closed the disc tray during shutdown, but, on my computer, Tails 0.12.1 is shutting down without ejecting the disc. Is this normal?

The shutdown sequence ends with "Starting new kernel", pauses for a few seconds, and then switches the computer off.

Is Tails shutting down correctly? Is the RAM being wiped correctly?
