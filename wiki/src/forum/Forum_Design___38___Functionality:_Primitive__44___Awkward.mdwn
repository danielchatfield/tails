I greatly appreciate Tails but I find the design, format and functionality of this *forum* oddly primitive and awkward. 

First and foremost, it is quite difficult to follow a thread and see when new replies have been posted. Not only do new replies not cause threads to bump to the top (as they do in just about every other forum I've seen) but the date in the "Updated" field does not actually update when a new reply is made. 

It is hard to imagine that this hasn't caused people to miss replies to their posts or other new posts in threads they were trying to follow.  

Some other issues:

1.) The way some of the basic posting functions are named is confusing.

To *start* a *new* thread, you have to click on a button named "*Edit*"

Then, under the box for entering the text of a *new* post that will *start* a new thread, you see the field,

"Optional comment about this *change*:" 
 
2.) It appears as if *anyone* can remove *any* post (even those of other's)

I just tested this by adding a paragraph in brackets at the end of the original post at https://tails.boum.org/forum/openvpn_support/

Presumably, this is the same for *removing* posts as well, but for obvious reasons, I did not test that.

3.) There is no way to tell which posts are from a Tails *developer* or a *moderator*/*administrator* of the forum. 

I am not suggesting that anyone need to reveal their personal identity in any way but simply that some generic tag be used by the devs when posting to identify themselves as such.

I hope these concerns will be considered.

Thank you to all who have made this distro possible. I wish you continued success.
