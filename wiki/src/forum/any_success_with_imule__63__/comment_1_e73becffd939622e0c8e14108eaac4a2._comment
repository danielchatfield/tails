I tried it, just to see if I could get it to work.
I succeeded. 
There's only a few things you'll need to do.

1. get the i386 squeeze package of imule
2. install its dependency libcrypto++8
3. enable SAM bridge in I2P console
4. bootstrap from a nodes.dat

That's how I got it up+running, FWIW.

Did you have any specific problems?
