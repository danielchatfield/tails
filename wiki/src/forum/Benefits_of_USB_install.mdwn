What are the benefits of a USB Tails and Live CD Tails? I don't feel comfortable using Tails on a USB thumb drive, because unlike optical media, USB sticks are rewrittable. 

Usually when you download a Linux distro, the first thing you do is update the system. This creates a need for an HDD/USB memory install. But from what I gather Tails software isn't updated in a piecemeal fashion. What I mean by this is that since Tails uses a custom browser, it won't bother you for updates every week or so, like the regular version of Firefox does. If indeed this is so (and I'm pretty new to Tails) wouldn't this obviate the need for a USB install?

Oh, and one more thing. Is it safer to unistall software you don't use? I have no use for Open Office, so would I be safer if I removed it from Tails?
