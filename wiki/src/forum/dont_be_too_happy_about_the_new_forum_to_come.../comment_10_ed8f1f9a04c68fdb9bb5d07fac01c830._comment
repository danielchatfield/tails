@ Comment 9:

Fine illustration of the kind of dimissive comment which appears in this forum far too often, and which runs contrary to the spirit suggested in 

     https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/help/

The problem with your comment is that it suggests that no-one with a concern can learn more than he/she currently knows about the dangers and difficulties of anonymity-promoting tools like Tails.

It seems to me that this forum should encourage anyone with concerns to learn more.  The way to do that effectively is to try to teach them just a bit more than they already know, day by day, by offering good information or a link to a good source at an appropriate level.

It has been true so far that information about tools like Tails tends to be either at the level of documentation for newbies, or documentation for experts.  It seems to me that since we have here non-developers willing and able to try to supply some of the missing documentation at an intermediate level, we should be encouraged to try our hand at doing that, rather than attacked for our efforts.
