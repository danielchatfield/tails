> They're \"the core developers\" - not appointed \"moderators\" and they have better things to do. Rather than attack the messenger if you don't like the message, why not do something positive about your perceived problem. Found a general privacy/conspiracy forum perhaps?

How know they are all developers and not also just helpful without coding? You cant know.

Whats the problem with a new moderator account? There is none. Just no one ever asked.

Please apply and become moderator or stop playing the moderator. If you know everything so well what they want they must accept you for moderator.
