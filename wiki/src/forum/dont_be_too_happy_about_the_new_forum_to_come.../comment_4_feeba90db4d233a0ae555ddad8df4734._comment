I think it's quite sad you began your post so negatively. I also think it explains your post's rather harsh reception. Personally I'm looking forward to \"the new forum\" very much. Not least because I consider the \"problems\" you mention to be *advantages*. I think your analogy is quite reasonable, although exaggerated. I think it can be extrapolated to illustrate the entire situation very well:

>You work as a \"computer scientist\" with other \"computer scientists\" discussing higher maths, network mechanics, coding theory, cryptography. You invest time and effort into documenting your work, you publish all papers freely and write beginners guides. Whats your interest in wasting your time going into the same trivial details of your work over and over again with people who haven't bothered to read any of the fine documents you've written for them? Whats your interest in wasting your time refereeing endless identical flamewars between people who can't be bothered to look at the fine documentation you and your colleagues have written for them?
