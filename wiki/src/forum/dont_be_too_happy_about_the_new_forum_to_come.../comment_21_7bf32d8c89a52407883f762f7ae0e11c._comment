>I would personally be totally delighted to see people find the most useful and relevant (question, answer) pairs in the current Tails forum, build a list of them, so that they can be migrated to the next question&answer tool we want (be it the same as Tor's one, or not -- it's not clear yet). These questions would probably benefit from some rephrasing, too.

So you don't really mean \"build a list\" of useful threads as much as distil those threads into question and answer pairs? Not being pedantic - just don't want to waste my time doing the wrong thing!

Is there somewhere this could be done collaboratively? Not much point in several people doing the same job in parallel! A TODO page perhaps?... Could also serve as *an interim* FAQ page in itself?
