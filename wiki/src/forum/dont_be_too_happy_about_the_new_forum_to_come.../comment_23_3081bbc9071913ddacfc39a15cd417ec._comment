OK, so, I've pushed a `doc/sort_the_forum` branch with the work that
was already done.

So here's how to do it.

For each forum thread in `wiki/src/forum/`:

    If the question is relevant and was answered well enough
    Then
        move the question and best answer to wiki/src/forum2migrate
        (with git mv)
    Else
        delete the whole thread (with git rm)

From time to time, merge from `master` branch to get the new threads.
From time to time, send us a pull request so that your work is
integrated into the main `doc/sort_the_forum` branch, and so that work
is not duplicated.

I'm told using `mc` helps in the process.
