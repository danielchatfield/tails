I mean building a list of existing high quality (question, answer) pairs.
I don't think we want to migrate full discussions.

I suggest using [[a Git branch|contribute/git]] that deletes
stuff that we don't want to migrate (as \"already checked\") and
somehow marks stuff we want to migrate (e.g. by moving it to
another directory). I think one of us had started doing so at
some point, let me ask.
