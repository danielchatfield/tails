I'm surprised how much discussion can be triggered by speculating whether some mostly undefined future thing will satisfy a huge set of mostly undefined needs.

You know, I'd be very happy to see people discuss what *they* can do, how *they* can prepare and organize themselves, to make this upcoming tool an awesome place.

E.g. I would personally be totally delighted to see people find the most useful and relevant (question, answer) pairs in the current Tails forum, build a list of them, so that they can be migrated to the next question&answer tool we want (be it the same as Tor's one, or not -- it's not clear yet). These questions would probably benefit from some rephrasing, too. This way, a substantial set of frequently asked questions would be there already when the migration happens. In our (Tails developers) view, we found it best if the interface one finds first on the next tool is a *search box*, rather than a *ask a new question without caring about whether it's been asked 20 times already* box, so it really would make sense to build this set of FAQ :)

To end with, there are many factors that contribute to the fact \"knowledgeable people\" find it pleasurable and useful to spend hours doing user support. It's neither \"they are not interested at all, and never will be\", nor is it \"they'll do it regardless of how I behave\". We've been giving hints about some of these factors on this very forum for a while. Every participant in a forum is responsible, to some extent, for the general atmosphere one finds in there, and responsible, to some extent, for how others are happy to read and usefully contribute to the discussion.

Cheers!
