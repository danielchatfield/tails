About Iceweasel addons, as explained on our [[persistence warning page|/doc/first_steps/persistence/warnings#index4h1]], it is usually a bad idea to install additional addons. So I'm not interested in helping in doing this.

Regarding the \"Network settings\" feature, what makes you believe that they are gone? Can you provide more information about the behavior that you think is erroneous? Probably [[reporting a bug|/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] would help.
