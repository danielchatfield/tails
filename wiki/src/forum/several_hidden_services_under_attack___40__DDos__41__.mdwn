well several bitcoin or communication hidden-services are under attack. tor mail is at least for me also unreachable.

does anyone know whats going on? it seems to be a hole in the tor-implementation. thats all i read till now.

does anyone have some info about it? does the tor-project has a forum? i mean i guess they allready know about this, but id like to be near the source and read something about it.

anyway, good day!
