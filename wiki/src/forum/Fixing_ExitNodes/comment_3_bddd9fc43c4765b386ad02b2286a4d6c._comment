Just tried tails and checked out the network map in vidalia, it was horrifying. 

US entry, US relay, some other country (GB) exit over and over (basically lots of circuits in countries who all aggressively share data with each other, \"five eye\" countries). It was even using the same US entry node for every new circuit being built. 

There really needs to be a way to stop circuits being built with the same country in then more than once, to allow you to build longer circuits and to ban certain servers that you may feel paranoid about.

Advanced Onion Router does this on windows but there's nothing as easy to use and effective on nix (?)
