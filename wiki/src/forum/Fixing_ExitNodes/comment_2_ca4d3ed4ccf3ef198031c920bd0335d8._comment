I would prefer if users who know what they are doing have a choice of using their own exit node preferences. When I look at the main page I see 
\"Numerous security holes in Tails 0.9\" 
\"Numerous security holes in Tails 0.8\" 
which should remind the developers that anyones expertise has limits. 
And some people have their reasons to ask for better exit node control in Tails times and again.
