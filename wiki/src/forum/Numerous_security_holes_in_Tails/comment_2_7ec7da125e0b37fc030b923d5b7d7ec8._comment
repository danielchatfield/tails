Thank you very much for your reply

zero day exploits, now I even have a name for it!

Yes Arbitrary code does sound ominous.

 The more I attempt to learn about secure browsing and the internet in general, the more I wish I lived in the days when communications involved a pen, paper and REASONABLE PRIVACY.  Nobody would write back if I sent them a snail letter nowadays, unless it included an email address lol

Many hours get sunk into studying about how insecure communications really are. Every hour I learn about a new tool only to be followed the next  by a realization that its merely a half-solution, it tires me. In my imagination I  see hordes of hackers and government computers pouring over TOR communications and all my hours of research towards security in vain. my imagination mocks me with

 \"it was compromised years ago by evil capitalist corporations and governments with access to billions of dollars of tax payers money.\"

 Dont think I am any different from the serf's being lorded over by their fuedal lords\" lol. ok imagination aside I say that any effort towards security is better than none, and keep the love letters for the post . lol. especially when that security can be updated and implemented by someone 'else. Thanks TAILS. Still even with this realization I still have to understand and trust the implementation and the work go on again, after you have completed your \"REAL\" working day that is.

 I know, if we extended the orbit of the planet out somewhat, we could increase the day to say 34 hours instead of 24, thereby allowing us to catch up on what in our technical knowledge has become obsolete before we closed our eyes last to sleep......
 
sleep, sleep, ahh yes. does that put me at risk? Do I need to review the parameters? 

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
