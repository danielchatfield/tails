Every system can / will be broken if enough resources are used. Tails is no exception.

The good thing about Tails is that security holes are being detected and fixed. All in the open. It gives me a good feeling. So far the evolution seems to favor Tails.

For many users it's the only communication tool they can use, the \"least worse\" option.

And no, snail mail secret communication is just as vulnerable, see for example the Queen Mary Of Scot's drama.
