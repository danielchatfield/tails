yes it's more than possible that hackers use exploits before they are discovered and patched upstream (by debian / mozilla etc.). Such an exploit can be referred to as zero day I believe as there is no current patch and everyone is vulnerable.

some serious exploits have gone for years unpatched - I think that there was a long standing issue discovered with debian or ubuntu (or both?) last year but I may be wrong.

hackers will sometimes design and trade exploits. I expect that governments also develop exploits as part of their cyber security arm (eg. stuxnet) so it's highly likely that there are many unknown exploits in the wild.

I think that open source software such as linux is safer from such issues though for the standard open source vs. proprietary reasons (eg. more eyes on the code). I might expect that a company selling proprietary software may be less forth coming with security vunerablities due to their commercial interests. Also, less people use linux making the dividends potentially smaller when compared to windows. Finally there is some serious enterprise that relies on linux for servers and the like which I'm sure adds some weight to the counter effort.

As you note, it is likely that a new vulnerability might be uncovered before the next large Tails release. IN my experience, Tails dev's are quick to give the warning and usually follow with a point release a couple of days later. This is pretty good as far as I am concerned - if someone needs anonymity for life or death reasons then at least they are informed and can avoid making any mistakes until the patch is published.

Regarding your last question, I do not feel like doing that research for you, but I will give a hint. Any mention of executing arbritary code refers to potentially running nasty code that could range from having your computer completely owned to having your website login details stolen. If you want peace of mind, I suggest you take a look for yourself.

To reduce risks you can disable scripts globally via the noscript button everytime you run the browser. Also, unless you have legitimate reason to expect a targetted attack against you or you have a habbit of visiting particulary dodgy websites then you should be fine anyway - Unless you get hit by a very specific trojan, Tail's amnesic properties should also provide some defence against zero day exploits (at least once you power down after being infected).

That said anything's possible and I'm no expert so I would appreciate if anyone else can correct me or chime in with more info.
