Virtualization is not secure whatsoever it's only function is for testing, like if your server is compromised and you want to check the image to do forensic analysis on a safe testing computer. It was never meant for 'security'.

The code in hardware/software virtualization is full of bugs so you are just layering bugs on top of older bugs and hoping for the best. It's taken developers 20 years to write out the x86/amd64 architecture bugs and they're still finding more everyday. Virtualization just adds to these potential exploits and privilidge escalation issues, plus who knows what'll happen when tails starts erasing memory upon shutdown.
