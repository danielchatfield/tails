*FALSE ALARM due to a series of unfortunate events?*

I believe the website has been attacked. Please consider not downloading Tails until this has been clarified by a Tails developer.

I believe that this is the case since the "Last Modified" date of the uploaded files has been changed to 20-Aug-2012 15:20 at: <http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.12.1/>

There has been no announcement of a Tails update or explanation for the possible modification.

The tails forum also appears to have been vandalized to include words such as cociane and PCP in the introductory text.
