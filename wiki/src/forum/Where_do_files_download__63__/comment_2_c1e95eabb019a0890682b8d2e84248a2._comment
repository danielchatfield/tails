They get downloaded to /home/amnesia/Downloads where /home/amnesia is the home directory for the user named amnesia aka the default TAILS user.

I usually issue the following command in the Terminal window before switching on my router:

    ln -s Desktop Downloads

which symbolically links the Downloads directory to the Desktop directory under the home directory - which means that all of your downloads then go to your Desktop directory by default.
