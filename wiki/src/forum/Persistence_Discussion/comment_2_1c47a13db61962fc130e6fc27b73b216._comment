This is reasonable. Added to the [[todo/persistence#index3h2]] todo page.

> 3 profiles would be in fact 3 logon users. user1, user2, user3, with possibility to change password but default password logon can be the same as username. 

That would not work well in Tails since the default user (amnesia) is dynamically configured during boot. Worse, separating the users like this gives very weak separation w.r.t. security -- if one is compromised, the others are as well most likely. Each profile must be inside a different encrypted container.
