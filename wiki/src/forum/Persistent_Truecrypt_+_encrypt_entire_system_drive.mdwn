"TrueCrypt can on-the-fly encrypt a system partition or entire system drive, i.e. a partition or drive where Tails is installed and from which it boots.
System encryption provides the highest level of security and privacy, because all files are always permanently encrypted (even when power supply is suddenly interrupted)."

How can I make Truecrypt persistent? Can I get the entire Tails usb drive encrypted? or can I use LUKS instead of Truecrypt to encrypt the entire Tails drive?
