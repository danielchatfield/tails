Fair enough, but the issue of peripherals generally has been on my mind so I seized the opportunity to try to raise it.

I acknowledge that the Tails developers must try to spend their time wisely, and that the todo list is full of worthwhile desiderata.  So to some extent you are the victim of your own past successes in writing excellent documentation when I suggest considering to add a page which elaborates on what you say in

     https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/anonymity/index.en.html

by offering more background on currently known hazards of using the internet, with links to such excellent sources as 

* the ACLU whitepapers on the Surveillance State
* EFF Surveillance Self Defense
* Bloomberg News series \"Wired for Repression\", on national scale surveillance systems
* similar series from the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and New York Times
* webpages where Wikileaks, WSJ, Washington Post, and some other organizations have published marketing fliers and white papers from companies selling malware and national scale surveillance systems (particularly important is a white paper from Aqsacom)
