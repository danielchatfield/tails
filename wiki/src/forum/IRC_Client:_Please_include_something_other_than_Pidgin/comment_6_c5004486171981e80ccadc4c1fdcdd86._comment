yes, TAILS is bloated as a dead cow on a hot summer day. Only thing missing from this \"privacy/security/livecd\" is 2GB of video games, so we don't get bored. WTF? And yes, what do *Office, video editors and other crap have to do with privacy distro. There are plenty distros that do the job on that field much better.

Anyway, when someone builds light TAILS, please let us know, so we can get of this balloon.
