> While I appreciate the effort of Tails developers, I'm close to creating and posting my own Tails based distro, using openbox without the non-essential utilities.

By all means, please do it! You seem to have a very different set of requirements. Tails is free software, so make yourself your home and hack around. :) Extra bonus points if your improvements can be easily merged back in Tails if they prove to be worthwhile.

Could you please explain more thoroughly why?

Whisperback is meant to answer this question: how can we improve Tails hardware support without leaking potentially identifiable informations?

Do you have something better to offer than a system that collects information, send them in an encrypted manner to a hidden service that then relays those informations to Tails developers (still encrypted)?
