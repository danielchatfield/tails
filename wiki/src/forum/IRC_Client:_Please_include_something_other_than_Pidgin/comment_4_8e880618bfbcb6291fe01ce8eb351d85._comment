Pidgin for Linux does not[1] have out-of-the-box support for IRC SASL authentication, which is important to have (for example, [2]). (There are two Pidgin patches[3, 4] for SASL authentication support, but they are beyond my skill level to implement, which means they are out of reach for many, many people.) Thus I agree: Tails should have a proper IRC client!
