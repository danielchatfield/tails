I have booted and run TAILS 0.12.1 many times since it was released. The vast majority of those times, I have added the extension *DownThemAll!* without any problems. After opening the Add-ons Manager in Iceweasel, I simply type "downthemall" into the search box, after which the correct extension appears and I proceed to install it without issue.

Well, you know how they say there's a first time for everything...

When I tried searching for "downthemall" in the Add-ons Manager now, I get the message,

*"Could not find any matching add-ons"*

Thinking there might be some problem with DownThemAll!, I tried searching for NoScript and AdBlock Plus and got the same thing! 

"Could not find any matching add-ons"

Needless to say I am quite alarmed at this sudden, seemingly inexplicable change.

I wonder, might the culprit be the now deprecated version of Iceweasel in TAILS? 

Perhaps the URIs at play changed and Iceweasel is still trying the old ones? Or something like that?
