[Q] How can I check online that obfs is functional ? https://check.torproject.org/ simply shows tor is running, but no obfs related information.

If you *needed* Obfsproxy you'd already *know*.  ;o)

As you're running Vidalia, you could always fire up its \"network map\" and review your circuits.

Is there any particular reason why you've installed and configured all the components separately, rather than running the TBB+Obfs2 bundle from the Obfsproxy project?

[Q] Is polipo really fast ? I hardly see any advantage comparing direct tor connection with out polipo.

No. Polipo and Privoxy are not the slowest link. Your connection can *never* be faster than your Tor circuit. You will however benefit from a significant *apparent* improvement when browsing as a result of the caching, pre-fetching and whatever else you've configured your proxy to do.
