Hi guys I am trying to get tails up and running on mac but seem to be having trouble. 

First I download this...

LATEST RELEASE

Tails 0.16 ISO image

Then next step verify iso image so I download this also...

I think follow linux with the command line and I struggle from here, I only have basic knowledge when it comes to computers I'm afraid, any help would be great?
