That may be true for some countries of residence, but not for all.

I have recently been experiencing very similar error messages when my Tails 0.16 system (booted from a R/O DVD) is first starting Tor.

I wonder if the problem could be some mismatch between Tor and Tails due to the recent somewhat botched TBB update.
