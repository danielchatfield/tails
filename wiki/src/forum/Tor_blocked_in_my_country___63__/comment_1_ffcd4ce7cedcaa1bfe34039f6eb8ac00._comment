Could be, but where is \"here\"?

I sometimes see warnings like these when Tails first starts, but in my case they are usually temporary, and simply waiting a minute or two allows Tails enough time to get everything working.

    [Warning] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 10%: Finishing handshake with directory server. 
    (DONE; DONE; count 10; recommendation warn)

That indicates that Tails was able to connect to at least one directory server, so your Tails could at least get on the Internet.  So the problem is probably not a simple networking problem.

When Tor starts it connects to directory servers to get information about what Tor nodes are currently available relay traffic.  It connects to several to ensure that no-one can easily mess with Tor by putting out false information (like listing only nodes controlled by your local secret police)

     [Warning] 7 connections died in state handshaking (TLS) with SSL state SSLv2/v3 
     read server hello A in HANDSHAKE

That means that at least 7 connections to Tor nodes (or other directory servers) dies during handshaking.  That *could* indicate that someone is using DPI to detect attempts to connect to known Tor nodes and is injecting packets to break the connection in mid-conversation.

    [Warning] 9 connections died in state connect()ing with SSL state (No SSL object)
    [Warning] 3 connections died in state handshaking (proxy) with SSL state (No SSL object)

More of the same, I think.

The key question is whether this problem was only temporary, when you first started Tails, or persisted even after waiting a few minutes.

If you think the problem is persistent and location-specific, you should tell us what country or at least what region you are trying to connect from.

Just curious, if you couldn't get Tails working at all: how did you post here?  Were you able to use Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) instead of Tails?
