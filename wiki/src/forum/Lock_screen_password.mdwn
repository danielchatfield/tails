I would like to see the "Lock screen" capacity reintroduced with the power button.

So I edited the todo :
<https://tails.boum.org/todo/better_power_off_button/>

But I have one question: Is this password is the same as the root acces password, and so we will have the possibility to define it at the boot? ( in the todo list here : <https://tails.boum.org/todo/better_root_access_control/> )

If until now the password is predefine, it's already usefull to lock the screen when leaving just a short moment (and of course when we can reach the emergency stop button faster than a potential attacker;).
