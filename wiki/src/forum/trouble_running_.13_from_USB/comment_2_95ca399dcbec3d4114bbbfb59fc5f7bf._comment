I know this answer sounds like 'turn it off and on again' but tend to find using Yummy to create a live USB doesn't seem to work first time for the new TAILS versions.  I don't know why, I am not technical, but if I re-create the live USB or get to work on one computer - it then seems to work OK from then onwards. Sorry, if a bad answer but just what I have experienced - e.g. don't always despair if doesn't always work 100% first time.
