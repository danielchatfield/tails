the above command will not fix the problem, just tell you if it is working or not. Follow the full instructions on that syslinux link, mainly

    sgdisk /dev/sdX --attributes=1:set:2

Then to confirm it is working:

    sgdisk /dev/sdX --attributes=1:show

Which should output the following if it is working:

     1:2:1 (legacy BIOS bootable)
