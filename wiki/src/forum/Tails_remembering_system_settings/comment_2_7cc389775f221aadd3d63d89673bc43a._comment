Please read the [[documentation about the persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence]], because it's not meant to do what you seem to think it is.

Our [[todo]] page lists a bunch of \"persistence presets\" that could be supported.
Feel free to add to the list. Please follow the page naming conventions, and describe *very precisely* what exactly you want to achieve there.
