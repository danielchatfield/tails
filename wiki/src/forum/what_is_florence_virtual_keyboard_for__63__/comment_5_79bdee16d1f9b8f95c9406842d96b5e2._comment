Perhaps the virtual keyboard could be made to appear with the Tails greeter?

As it is now, any password created with the Tails greeter would be subject to capture by a hardware keylogger.

Possible workaround: Create a temporary, generic (non-unique) password when prompted by the Tails greeter. Then, immediately after Tails has fully booted, change the temporary password to a secure one using the Florence virtual keyboard. (using the `passwd` command in terminal)

By the way, isn't there some sort of attack (involving screen capture or the like, I think) that even virtual keyboards could be susceptible to?
