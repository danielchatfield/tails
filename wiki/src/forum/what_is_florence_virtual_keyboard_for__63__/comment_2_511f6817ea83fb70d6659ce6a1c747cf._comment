I honestly thought I had read through the entire documentation.  But, apparently I had skipped over that small block of stuff at the top.  Something I catch myself doing from time to time.  Sorry for wasting time and thank you for your response.  I love this distro and can usually find all kinds of neat uses for it's pre-installed programs.  However, this one I couldn't really realize it's application towards privacy.  I have assumed that all keyloggers were installed on the hard-drive's operating system and were of no use if the computer were running a live OS booted up from another drive.  It's good to know that this may not be the case.  Thanks again for your time.
