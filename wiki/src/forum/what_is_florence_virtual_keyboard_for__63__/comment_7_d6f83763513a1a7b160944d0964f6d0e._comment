Please read the first question/answer on the [[contributors FAQ|contribute/faq]].

An attacker that has captured the password can setup a fake
`passwd` command that captures the newly entered password,
regardless of the virtual keyboard. It's not that easy to setup
a *secure* password in a compromised environment.
