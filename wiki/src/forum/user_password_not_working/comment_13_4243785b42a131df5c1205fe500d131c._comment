@Tails: a correct bug report was filled and sent few minutes ago using \"Report a bug\" function. Details to recreate the bug were included. 

To others: the bug trival to recreate once you figure it out. It was a good brain exercise. ;-)))

I do not write steps to recreate the bug here because I do not want bad people to make use of this bug.
