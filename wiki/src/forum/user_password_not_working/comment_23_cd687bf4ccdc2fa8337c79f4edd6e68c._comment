Good news indeed. :D

Many thanks for taking the time to explain.

Personally I'd much rather feed the necessaries on the boot line and avoid the horrid greeter thing altogether. (\"horrid\", not just because it's somewhat flaky atm but because it'll only get bigger and bigger and I'd prefer not to be stopped during every boot only to have to re-enter the same old shite. I'd prefer the boot process wasn't interrupted at all. Especially as my bootloader could easily be set to supply Tails with everything it needs automatically). So please don't hold your breath for help with the greeter thing ;-)

*Securely* feeding a session password from the kernel boot line, on the other hand, and thus murdering the greeter thing, is a can of worms I'm quite tempted to have a squint inside. So that link might just come in handy 0:)
