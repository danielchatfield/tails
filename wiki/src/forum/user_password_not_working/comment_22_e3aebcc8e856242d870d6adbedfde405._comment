The bug is triggered by a combination of two factors.

The first is some mismatched variable names in the [GdmGreeter.language.\_\_del\_\_](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=blob;f=GdmGreeter/language.py;h=8b791c5e62f9a0bf54d811fc04c551fe8dbd6817;hb=HEAD#l302) method. This lead to a crash as in some cases the `layout` variable was not defined when used (but `layouts` was...). This bug only appeared now because of the changes that allowed to select layout variants introduced in tails-greeter version 0.7. A really trivial one to fix.

The second factor is that the crash itself prevented some 'deleters' to run, one of them being the [one responsible to register the administrative password](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=blob;f=GdmGreeter/rootaccess.py;h=f22b9e1ac75f0e6f82e455a9bbdaf229c0314229;hb=HEAD#l37). That design is bug prone, and the simple improvement is to \"register\" settings right when they get changed in the UI.

Those issues have no security implication whatsoever.

(Yes, we are aware that `tails-greeter` is not up to the level of quality it should beâ€¦ As always, help is welcome as our resources are in short supplies.)

But if you really are interested in that level of details, you should subscribe to the [tails-dev@ mailing-list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-dev) and help development efforts (like testing release candidates)! :)
