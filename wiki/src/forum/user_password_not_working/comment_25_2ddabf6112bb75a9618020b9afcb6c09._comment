Well I DO hope it will be fixed soon one way or another as it is very very annoying, I sometimes have to re-load tails 3 or 4 times before i can get a working root password, and I need use it every time I use tails to mount a Truecrypt volume, tried the tab trick to no avail 
Thanks for tails and your work though it is a very useful bit of kit.
