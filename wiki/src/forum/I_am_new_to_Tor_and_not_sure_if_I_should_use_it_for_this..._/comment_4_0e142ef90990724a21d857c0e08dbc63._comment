There is no easy answer to those questions:

**If you use TOR from home :**

**(+)** your ISP won't see the content of your communication

**(-)** your ISP will see that you use Tor

**If you always use Tor now:**

**(+)** you will be kind of anonymous on internet

**(-)** you are not [[protected against everything|doc/about/warning]]

**etc,etc**

Your solution depends on your threat model, on the political situation of your country, on the usuability you want to have with your tools..
