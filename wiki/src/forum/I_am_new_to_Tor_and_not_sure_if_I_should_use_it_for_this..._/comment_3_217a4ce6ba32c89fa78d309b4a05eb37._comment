Just wondering about this though would tor be a useful tool though to like anonymously get email to like an email client? Just wondering what's safe to do. Don't want to make things worse than it already is. I kind of just want it so that I can just access my email without worrying about the stuff I don't know tracking maybe like what computer I use somehow which I don't know but feel is possible and like what the ISP sees in the background. If that's the case should I also only use Tor on like networks that aren't home networks like my own ISP I guess then? Also, should I like always use tor now? Would it work like for getting email anonymously I guess? This stuff gets me confused.
