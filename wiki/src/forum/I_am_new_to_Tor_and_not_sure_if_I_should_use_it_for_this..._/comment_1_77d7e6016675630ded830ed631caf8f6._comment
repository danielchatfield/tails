basically I was wondering if I should use it for getting my old emails using an email client to gather them and then deleting them once I got off. I've been told the best way to get them off of there is just trying to delete them off and hope the provider will take care of the rest for you. Is there a way I could take back my private emails I already sent out? What should I do? Also, how could Tor help and should I use Tor for this?
