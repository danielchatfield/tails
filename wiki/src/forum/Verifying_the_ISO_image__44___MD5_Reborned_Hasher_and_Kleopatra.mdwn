Okay, so I've lodged numerous search queries on this website and Google about verifying the Tails .iso image with a program called Kleopatra. People have had the same problem as me and have made threads about it, but most of the responders aren't helpful insofar as they either haven't used the program or they simply urge people to use the search function on this website. The fact 'this precise question is being asked in this precise manner', as one poster said, should evidence that the tutorial is not substantial. I think I've followed it word for word, but I'm sure that I've had little luck.

For those who haven't checked the documentation, Kleopatra is described as a means of checking the .iso file validity; the alternative for Windows is to use a program on Mozilla Firefox called MD5 Rebound Hasher, which is actually no longer compatible with Mozilla Firefox.

So I'm using Windows. I've imported as a certificate the signature per the guide. I see that it's imported. I click File > 'Decrypt/Verify'. I then select the .pgp file and input the .iso file as the signed data. I wait for a few minutes and the program states that the file couldn't be verified: "Not enough information to check signature validity" - it then states when and who signed the file but that "the validity of the signature cannot be identified". Somebody said I have to mark the signature as trusted, but this isn't in the guide. So what am I supposed to do?
