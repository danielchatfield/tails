Now that Tails greeter gives us the possibility to set a password, we can safely* lock the screen using a keyboard shortcut (and perhaps soon from the [[power off menu|todo/better_power_off_button/]]). 

To use it, install the *xscreensaver* package (3 514 ko), and use the keyboard shortcut already set in Gnome (Ctrl+Alt+L).

(If nothing happens, type this command in a terminal : *xscreensaver-command  -lock*, and if you get an error message like *no screensaver is running on display*, you can workaround this by launching it manually : *xscreensaver  -no-splash&*. Give a sign if you find a way to solve this last step)

**A question to the developpers:** As the *xscreensaver* package will be include in Tails for the [[better power off menu|todo/better_power_off_button]], is it possible to ship it, without waiting for this menu to be developed (for example in Tails 0.12 ;) ?

Greetings,

*Tails' X server actual version -seems- to be not affected, but this lock is [in some conditions bypassable](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/onehx/every_linux_screen_locker_broken_by_a_keypress/). I have no time to check this deeply now.. Do you ?
