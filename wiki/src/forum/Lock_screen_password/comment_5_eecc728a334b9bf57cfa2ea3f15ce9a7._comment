Here is a step by step way to make it work:

1. In Tails Greeter, chose yes to \"More Options\" and set an administration password (remember it)

2. Open a Root Terminal

3. Type:

root@amnesia:/home/amnesia# apt-get update

root@amnesia:/home/amnesia# apt-get install gnome-screensaver

4. open a Terminal and type:

amnesia@amnesia:~$ gnome-screensaver

5. You can go to System -> Preferences -> Screensaver

and check \"Lock screen when screensaver is active\"

If you're using Persistence, you can make apt cache persistent so you won't have to do #apt-get update every time you start Tails and want to use gnome-screensaver.
