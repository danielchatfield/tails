You need to install vlock or anybody can walk up and hit control-alt + F1 through F6 which opens the virtual console. Then they would simply kill the process for the gnome-screensaver and gain access to your computer.

vlock will lock all virtual consoles using vlock -a (a being all which locks all virtual consoles) The gnome-screensaver or xscreensaver will only lock your windows virtual console or F7 but leaves all other virtual consoles open to attack.
