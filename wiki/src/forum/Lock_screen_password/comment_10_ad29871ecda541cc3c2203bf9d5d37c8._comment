I did some tests:

I used *rootpw=PASSWORD* on the kernel command-line and followed all the steps from the comment \"[A bit faster](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Lock_screen_password/#comment-99ba7d164b0da576452b6c4387f82728)\".

I then tried *System â†’ Lock screen* and *Ctrl + Alt + L*.. 

Nothing, until I run *gnome-screensaver* in a terminal.

Then, I successfully started the screensaver and was asked for a password to unlock. The *rootpw* set on the kernel command-line did'nt worked, I had to reboot.

I guess the method explained in the comment \"A bit faster\" needs to be completed by this step:

    amnesia@amnesia:~$ gnome-screensaver
