I´m having problems with tails 0.1 running in a virtualbox vm with ubuntu as the host. I´m not able to see the cursor of the mouse. Sometimes I can see it for a short moment but it´s also damn slow. If i press strg + i the cursor shows up and in case i hover over any buttons they get highlighted or a description of the button occurs but I can´t click any of them. The Ubuntu host is itself a guest in a windows vm, though I guess this doesn´t matter since I can run windows xp or liberte linux vm´s without any problems in the ubuntu vm.
