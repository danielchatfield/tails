>I don't know whether every user of TAILS or TOR is having the same fingerprint

Yes.

>[Do] TOR nodes ISPs also retain those spoofed/changed browseragent record?

Perhaps partially. Apart from the entry and exit connections they never even get to see them.

>Suppose you are traced SOMEHOW, then you can take a plea that you don't own a MAC computer and thus it will be a ground of defence for you or say that it will weaken the prosecution theory, isn't it?

I'd imagine any police/prosecution service capable of forensically tracing someone across a Tor connection would have a reasonable comprehension of the UA string and its malleability. Anyway, the UA is being spoofed already of course, so you could just as well try your luck with \"I've never even installed Windows™ Vista™ (or whatever 6.1 is) meelud, yuck™\".

>...before using these addons.

Using any \"addon\" is risky. Even *enabling* them in the browser would be a dangerous deviation from default. At the *very least*, be *sure* to *thoroughly* audit the addon's code, the browser, the effect on your UA and the consequences to your \"uniqueness\", etc., before making any such change.
