>...a random UA everytime...

Randomly *generated* or randomly *selected*?

I'd have thought a randomly *generated* UA would be a disaster - likely to be very distinctive and therefore conspicuously connect all the sessions activity together.

*Selecting* a session UA at random, on the other hand, perhaps from a list of the twenty-or-so most common UA strings, could be worthwhile. You'd still be a needle in a large haystack during each session *and* you'd be a different needle every session. The list could be refreshed periodically to keep abreast of browser trends and at the same time keep the pool moving.
