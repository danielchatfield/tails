I have searched and read a post https://tails.boum.org/forum/Java__63__/ but am not sure whether Java is shipped with or installed on Tails 0.16 by default.

According to US Homeland Security Department's advisory, see http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/625617

and New York Times: http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/department-of-homeland-security-disable-java-unless-it-is-absolutely-necessary/

users of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS and Linux are strongly advised to disable Java.
