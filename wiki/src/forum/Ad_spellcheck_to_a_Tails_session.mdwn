As a non-native English speaker I often rely on spelllcheck to catch my frequent misspelllings. Since I often misspelll the same words in the same ways, I am afraid that my particular pattern of mispellling could become part of my traceable digital footprint. I am using Tails to try to be anonmyous and I could face serious repercussions if my identity were to be compromised and one way that Government agents might learn my identity could be to create a database of documents they think are created by me which are all linked by similarities in topic, tone, grammar and mispelllings. Being able to turn on English spelllcheck for either the OpenOffice.org Writer or Iceweasel would be a privacy enhancement for me.

I have looked at a few other forum discussions that deal with this topic, but could not understand the replies. Please tell me a way to turn on spelll check during a Tails session. Please use simple language because I don't have great reading comprehension and I am only semi-computer literate. 

I thank you very much for your attention and thanks for an awesomes project.
