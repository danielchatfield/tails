>Is it possible in the near future that community be able to provide protection methods even against an adversary like NSA?

Yes, but first answer my question: how near is your \"near future\"? 5, 10 or 20 years from now?

If the Chinese and the Russians start collaborating in earnest now, their combined effort can bring down not only NSA but the Pentagon and all the US grids.

Just look at North Korea. It claims that it is able to strike the USA with nuclear warheads.

I repeat: if only the Chinese and the Russians start collaborating now.
