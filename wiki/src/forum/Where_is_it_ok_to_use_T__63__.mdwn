Hello I've never used tails before but I've been thinking about it for a while simply to have some privacy I guess. No real big reason. I'm not an activist or anything. Just a simple user of the internet looking for a way to use it.

Part of the reason I've never used tails yet is because I feel ignorant of the dangers if there are for a simple user just by using tails I guess. I don't know. I'm afraid to use it at home cause the ISP or whatever and afraid to connect at a public wifi cause what about this mac address? I don't know. I worry to much to even really use my email accounts much anymore fearing all this all the sudden. I just don't really know exactly what's going on and how I should act and what I'm really doing so I don't. I guess I'm just looking for a simple way around or solution to use the internet innocently and privately.
