In another thread, \"Tails\" has stated that the `toram` option described in comment 2 above is *not* supported.

I understand this means that anyone choosing to do it does so at his or her own risk. 

But I wonder whether the risks of using `toram` include critical *safety* ones (anonymity/security) or merely *performance* ones?
