experiment: open Tor Network Map, and in Root Terminal execute "tcpdump -i eth0". (replace <eth0> with whatever your network interface is) Now watch the Connection list in Tor Network Map as it generates outbound traffic... 

Isnt it strange that just passive packet observation generates activity in Tor network?
