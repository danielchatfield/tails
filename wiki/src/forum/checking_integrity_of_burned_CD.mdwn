Please play along.

Suppose someone exchanged CDs and replaced your burned version of Tails (10.1) with their version. Suppose their version sends copies of your traffic to them.

1. How would you check the integrity of the burned CD to insure it is the same one?

2. How could you determine if your traffic is sniffed like that and sent over the wire or covertly saved somewhere?

If nothing else, it is an interesting thought experiment.
