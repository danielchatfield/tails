\"Today, with the cheap 4 gig pendrives available everywhere, I have little need for stripped down Linux.\"

The issue is security, not storage space.

The more packages, codecs, modules, services, etc. you have, the more you open yourself up to possible security issues.

I know I can roll my own distro, that wasn't the point.

In a distro such as Tails, leaner would be better. For hardware support, some of the tiny distros have add-on packages to add support, that's the point of smaller distros, you can build on it.

Were Tails to build on a tiny distro, they would most likely add support for various hardware. It was not suggested to roll & ship a tiny based distro in a tiny state, without extra packages.
