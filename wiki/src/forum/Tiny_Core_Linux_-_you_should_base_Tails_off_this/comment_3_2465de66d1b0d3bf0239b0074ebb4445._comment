I had problems with those \"tiny\" Linux distros. Especially with network / wifi adapters. The \"big\" ones, line e.g. Ubuntu, seem to work on a broad range of hardware. Also I like the Office suite.

Today, with the cheap 4 gig pendrives available everywhere, I have little need for stripped down Linux.
