@4: This is the Tails forum... for discussing Tails. If you feel strongly about a *different* project and wish to facilitate its development, then *you* should contribute to it, rather than wasting your time posting irrelevant & O/T messages here. I hear that the project you advertise has only a single developer, so I'm certain your assistance would be welcome.
