> The developers have been busy this week putting up Tails 0.16 (with increased urgency owing to the TURKTRUST breach)

FTR, Tails 0.16 release cycle was published more or less
according to [[schedule|contribute/release_schedule]].
Our current workflow and infrastructure does not really allow
hurrying things to release much less that a week after a Firefox
ESR is out.

> why tails developers dont unit efforts to create software like whonix?

The main current reason is about diverging design goals: Tails
has a focus on not leaving traces on local media
(see [[about]] and [[contribute/design]]), while Whonix has other
valuable priorities.
