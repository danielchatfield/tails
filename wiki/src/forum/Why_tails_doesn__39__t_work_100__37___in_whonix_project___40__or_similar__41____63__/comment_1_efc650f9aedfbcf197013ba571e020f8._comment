This has been discussed in several other recent threads in this forum.  The developers have been busy this week putting up Tails 0.16 (with increased urgency owing to the TURKTRUST breach), so I'll try to help out by saying what I think they'd say with greater authority and accuracy than I can manage.

The Tails developers have stated that Whonix is indeed an interesting and promising project, but for various reasons, the Tails Project and Whonix Project are not likely to merge in the near future.

If you want to see their own words, try using the \"search\" tool above to look for threads mentioning \"Whonix\" and inside those threads, look for posts by \"Tails\".
