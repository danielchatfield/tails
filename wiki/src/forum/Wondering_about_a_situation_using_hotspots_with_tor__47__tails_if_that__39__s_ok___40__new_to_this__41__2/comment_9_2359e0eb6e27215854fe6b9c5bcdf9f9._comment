>> This is a real problem because the default passwords to the \"secret\" accounts always become known to the bad guys (indeed, sometimes the bad guys are governments who demand that manufacturers insert backdoors).

Is there any point in changing the username and password for my modem? I log in by giving the credentials my IPS provided me. Since I use those credentials to connect to the internet, I'm assuming that those are unique to my computer, but I also read that modems from the same maker all use the same IP to access the configuration page. Does this mean than an attacker than just access that configuration page and from there read all the stuff I sent through Tails? What can I do to prevent this from happening?
