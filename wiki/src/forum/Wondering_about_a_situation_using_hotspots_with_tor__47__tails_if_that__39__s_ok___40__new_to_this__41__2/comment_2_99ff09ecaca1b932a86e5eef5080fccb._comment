oh ok no I didn't try actually this time but I did before on the mac address thing and I didn't really get a clear answer and the subject has always brought me confusion. I'm just looking for a simple answer if there is one as I'm not very as tech minded as everyone else seems to be and am kind of I guess a newb at this stuff if that's ok to say but I have to say all this stuff is on my mind a lot and deeply concerns me for some reason. I guess its just my personality or whatever. 

But anyways I'll take a look then but if someone could at least help me out with the mac address part I guess. Like is it something I should worry about when connecting to a hotspot or going online or whatever? When should I worry about it? I've looked it up and still don't really understand it but like I said I'm not very smart when it comes to how computers tick.
