you can SEND anonymous email thru site like Anonymouse.org, which offers a simple form and then delays sending for up to 12 hours to enhance anonymity.  i think hidemyass and a few others has similar form and availability.  

RECEIVING email via anon account is also available thru sites like Guerrilla Mail, Dispostable, and many others i believe.

my experience was it was easy to find sites to receive anonymous email for quite a while and until recently i never knew about the ability to send anon email.  it thought it was forbidden because of probability of spam.
