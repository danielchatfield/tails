Hello,

I have used GPG4win until now when I was using Windows.  It was just simple matter or importing the keys and encrypting the message on the clipborad with the key.

I'm bit lost on how to go about importing PGP keys and encrypting messages with the saved keys.

Could someone help please?  Thank you.
