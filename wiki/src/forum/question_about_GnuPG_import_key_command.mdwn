I'm confused by the GnuPG command on [this page](https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#index3h1). The command given is:

`cat tails-signing.key | gpg --keyid-format long --import`

This is correct, of course, but why do it this way? It seems simpler to do it without piping anything, like this:

`gpg --import tails-signing.key`

Is there a benefit to piping output from `cat tails-signing.key` to GnuPG?  Also, does using the long form of the keyID make a difference? (the signing key shows up in my keyring identically either way)

I tried it all three ways, and got identical results (as far as I could tell, at least); I wonder if there are reasons for the command as written that are too subtle for me to detect.

Thanks!
