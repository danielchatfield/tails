It depends on the addon. If it alters browser fingerprint you will look less like other Tails users (and even more less than Tor Browser users) which in the end hurts your anonymity. So, avoid addons that changes anything w.r.t. the network. Addons that just modify the GUI or other offline stuff should be ok, but we don't guarantee anything of course.

It's safe, especially if only used for offline viewing.

> p.s. where can I download rc0.11?

Any beta or release candidate are always available [here](http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/testing/) (but you may benefit from reading [this post](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-April/001065.html) first).
