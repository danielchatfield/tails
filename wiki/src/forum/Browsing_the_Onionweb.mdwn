I'm interested in Tor Hidden Services and there's a couple of .onion sites I want to visit. Mostly the Hidden Wiki and several message boards. But according to most articles I've read, the Onionweb or Darknet or whatever is full of child pornography. 
I don't think I'd be able to stomach that kind of material. Not just that, I'm pretty sure that even viewing CP accidentally could get you in big trouble. So I'm looking for a way to browse the OnionWeb without being exposed to that filth. Can this be accomplished? Maybe by disabling "Load images automatically" on IceWeasel? But I'm pretty sure this would damage my anonymity.

Can anyone think of a solution?
