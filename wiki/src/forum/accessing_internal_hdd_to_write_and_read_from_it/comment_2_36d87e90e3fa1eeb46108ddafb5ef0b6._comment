hello, well of course i can do it as superuser,
 but wish to be able to mount internal drive as regular \"amnesia\" user
and of course without having to use the console

note that connecting a drive via usb do not require anything particular...
it is mounted by itself

i understand limitations of Tails as for security reason, nevertheless 
in some case mounting the internal drive might be usefull...

thanks !
