Before filing a bug report is it my system or Tails?

Connection is lost after about 10 minutes and a message appears stating no connection. A refresh of the network map will turn up empty path or something and failed.

A reboot is necessary. On reboot Tails goes all the way to the end but doesn't shut down or spit out the DVD.

Anyone else having the same problems?
