I'm back after a new try (see comment 3)
Nothing's changed with those df or du results.
I've been having a look on processes shown by top during the bug : nothing special, except perhaps this Xorg peak for an instant (but nothing obvious)
I also wanted to tell a word about my system : tails 0.10.1, running on usb, with 2Go ram on my computer. The bug is old as far as I'm concerned (since 0.8, perhaps before)
Hope someone will find what's wrong, or I will try to learn mutt !
