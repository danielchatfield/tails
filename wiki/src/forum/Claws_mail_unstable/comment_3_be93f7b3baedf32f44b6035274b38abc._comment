I've also got problems with this bug & I begin to be used with (even if I haven't found any solution, nor I can get error infos)
However for the 1st time today I could avoid restarting system. Here's what I've try, if it can help.

First, switching on tty2 and launching 'invoke-rc.d gdm3 restart'
Afterwards I was back on the gnome desktop (tty8), with all apps closed. I then launched this 'ps aux | grep claws' which would show me a surviving claws-mail process. Trying to launch claws-mail again, it would bug when trying to reach the IMAP server.
Another 'ps aux | grep claws' would show me this time *2* running claws processes. Made me think that claws was not killed with the gdm3 restart command.
Therefore I could get with the 'killall -9 claws-mail' command, all claws processes to stop.
Launching it one more time I could have it work noramlly and so reach the IMAP server and then try to read my mail... until it bugs again with this \"passphrase bug\" !
Switching again to tty2 allowed me to restart gdm3 once again, and to \"killall -9\" this remaining process.

Hurra folks : I can turnaround with this bug without having to restart the system... but I still can't read my mails ! 

However this workaround allowed me to run those commands suggested on 'comment1'. Here are the results, that seem pretty normal :

du -csh .claws-mail
3,7M .claws-mail
3,7M total

df -h /live/cow
tmpfs   1013M   41M   972M   5%   /live/cow

I will keep on trying to find what's wrong, and post new messages if I find anything.
