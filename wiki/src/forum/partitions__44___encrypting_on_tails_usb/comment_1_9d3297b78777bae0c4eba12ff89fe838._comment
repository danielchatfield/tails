There's a guide [[on the forum|forum/How_do_I_do_what_unetbootin_does/#comment-fc6a0040a29918839343a50396ef4082]], but it might be a waste of time since Tails 0.11 (which is due this month) will support it out-of-the-box in a user-friendly and more flexible way that is not compatible with the method described in that guide.
