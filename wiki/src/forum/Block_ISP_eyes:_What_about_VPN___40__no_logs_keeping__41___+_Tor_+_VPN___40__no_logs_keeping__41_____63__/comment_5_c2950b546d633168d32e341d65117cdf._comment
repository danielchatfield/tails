Ouch indeed! I'm not sure that's fair.. on two counts!

1. Markdown, po, html... formatting seems to me to be this \"forum\"s only *strong* point! Have you seen [this](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki/formatting/)?

2. It's hardly fair to call this \"forum\" a forum. Think of it more as a brutally abused blog/wiki ;-)
