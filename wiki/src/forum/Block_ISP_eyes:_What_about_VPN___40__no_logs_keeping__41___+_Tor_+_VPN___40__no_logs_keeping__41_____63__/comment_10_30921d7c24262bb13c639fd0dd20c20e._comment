>b. even if they did they wouldn't hand it over to lea If you were the lea, how would you approach those problems?

Quite.

Injunction/court-order/raid/imprisonment... there are many well established and very effective methods for tackling persistent criminal activity (which withholding duly requested server logs from the police would clearly be). The efficiency of the system is beautifully illustrated by the fact that we don't spend our lives amongst continuous total anarchy. It's often referred to as *the rule of law*. A company flouting *the law* in this manner could not exist for long, so the fact these companies do exist proves that they do in fact comply with their legal obligations. But how can this be? The assurances these VPN operators offer are what's technically known as **lies**. Sometimes also referred to by the quaint euphemism \"marketing\". It has been known for less scrupulous companies (notably those purporting to offer legally dubious \"services\" and, curiously, US banks) to say things which may not be entirely honest to the stupid people in order to part them from their hard earned wages/dole. Thus profit is made... that *is* the function of companies you know. The stupid people never find out (or not until it's too late anyway) and even if they did, what could they do?.. walk into a police station and say \"this company told me they'd hide my online activity from the police but didn't... I demand you arrest them\"? Meanwhile the police find they suddenly have a nice honey-pot brimming over with all the minute details of all the online antics of stupid people who've inexorably and forensically linked their internet activity to their bank accounts or Bitcoin wallets or whatever. Saves setting up any more of those distasteful child-porn-by-credit-card sites... and eliminates any defence of \"entrapment\" too. Splendid.

Obviously, the **ONLY** VPN you could even consider trusting is one run and hosted by yourself. Or *possibly* by an organisation to which you belong and which you trust. Hardly anonymous in either case.

>Why do you post contradictory statements?

What \"contradictory statements\"?

>First, even if VPNs retain logs, how does it make any difference because the VPN IP exactly works like our own IP. When we use TOR without VPN, our IP gets recorded with the first node. And, when we use VPN, the IP address of VPN gets recorded with the first node.

How \"your\" is \"your\" ISP? Might friends/family use it? Neighbours perhaps? WiFi point? Open access? WEP/WPA? Has it ever been cracked? Are you sure? Is it even \"yours\" at all? Do you use an internet-cafÃ©/library/junkfood-establishment perhaps? All a bit nebulous really isn't it? Replacing that with a VPN you've paid for, or even just use regularly, is about as stupid as a serial killer sending their taunting letters to the police via courier rather than in the post.

>If you say that it is hard to reach the first node IP from the third node (which is interacting with websites/destination), then how will it make a difference whether the IP with the first node is ours or that of VPN? Kindly clarify.

Making the *first* hop by VPN should only be a problem if Tor its-self was compromised - in which case you may have made yourself even more identifiable than you might otherwise have been. IMO it's only of any potential benefit if your connection is firewalled in a manner which prevents direct Tor connections or where the mere use of Tor is prohibited or potential cause for persecution.

Making the *last* hop by VPN on the other hand would obviously completely destroy any potential anonymity provided by Tor. You'd be stamping your VPN identity all over your anonymised traffic!

On the bright side, I suppose anyone stupid enough to fall for the \"*we don't keep logs honest and we couldn't keep them even if we wanted to, honest, but we don't even want to, honest, anyway there are no laws/police in our country anyway, honest*\" sales patter can always cheer themselves by thinking happy thoughts of the Darwin Award they've got coming, while they're being forced to pick up the prison soap for the fiftieth time that morning.
