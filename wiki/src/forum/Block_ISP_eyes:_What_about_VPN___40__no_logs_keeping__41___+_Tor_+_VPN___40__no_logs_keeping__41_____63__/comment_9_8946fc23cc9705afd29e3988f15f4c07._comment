First, even if VPNs retain logs, how does it make any difference because the VPN IP exactly works like our own IP. When we use TOR without VPN, our IP gets recorded with the first node. And, when we use VPN, the IP address of VPN gets recorded with the first node.

If you say that it is hard to reach the first node IP from the third node (which is interacting with websites/destination), then how will it make a difference whether the IP with the first node is ours or that of VPN? Kindly clarify.
