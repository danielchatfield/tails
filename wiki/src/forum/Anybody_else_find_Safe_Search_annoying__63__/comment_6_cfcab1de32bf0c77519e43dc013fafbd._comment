Calm down people. 

I'm inclined to think this entire thread is a parody. Either that or at least one poster's SoH has seriously malfunctioned. 

Either way, it's not worth getting all sweaty and profane over. Perhaps, rather than rattling off abuse, someone might consider contributing something *constructive*? Explaining to OP how to turn off Startpage's \"safe search\" maybe?

Just a thought.
