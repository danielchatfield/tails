Perhaps working under the assumption that most of the users of a anonymity and censorship resistant distro based on Tor would not appreciate censorship even in the form of a search engine filter.

And please keep your judgements of valor to yourself. Your \"adolescent jinx and the stereotypical kid\" have as much right to use the software as you. And watching p0rn is part of the internet activities of many many users. But perhaps you make a point in that filtered search engines should also be present, so as not to inconvenience moralistic people who think everyone should conform to their views.
