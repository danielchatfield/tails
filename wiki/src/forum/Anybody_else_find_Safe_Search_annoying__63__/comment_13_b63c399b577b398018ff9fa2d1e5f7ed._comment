Even if it is, such antics hardly does wonders for the reputations of Tails, Tor and privacy/anonymity in general.

Unfortunately, the comments in question in this thread do not appear isolated; I've been seeing quite a bit of such adolescent jinx around here lately. Is the typical, average or target TAILS user really nothing more than the stereotypical kid in the proveribal \"candy store\" of virtually unlimited access to \"adult\" content? (Or \"script-kiddie\"?)

@comments 11 and 12:

Are you working under the assumption that the average or typical Tails user would *not* want the default *image/graphic* filters to be in place for their searches? That Mr./Mrs./Dr../ Avg. Tails User would have no problem with having sexually explicit or violent images in their results when they were not searching for such content?
