Sure, there are indeed ways to add persistence to Tails. None of those is supported by Tails developers, though. When setting up full system persistence as documented above:

1. Upgrading to a newer Tails version will be a pain and implies re-doing all you customization work.
2. The *amnesic* part of Tails is lost. Really. More generally, once you do that, you're on your own and you cannot assume your modified Tails provides the security / anonymity / privacy features is is supposed to. Good luck.
