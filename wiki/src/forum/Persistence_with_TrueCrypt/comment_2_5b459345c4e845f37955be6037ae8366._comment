There is a way to add persistence. I have successfully done it already. works fine. But I don't recommend it for security reasons.

All Debian distros can use the persistence feature at the boot prompt. just remove the no-persistence entry and add the word \"persistent\" to the boot options. The system will then look for a persistence file called \"live-rw\". It is the same as a casper-rw file. Generally It needs to be in the root directory of the pen drive. 
You can use the \"dd if=zero...\" to make your own live-rw file. 
Use this (from linux not windows) to create your own live -rw : 

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=live-rw bs=1M count=1024

it will create a 1 GB (1024 MB) casper file that is called \"live-rw\".

copy it to the root (or proper area) of your pendrive and then modify the live.cfg file in the syslinux folder of the pendrive. 

Here is my 2nd entry in the live.cfg file:

label tails-en2
	menu label ^English-Persistent
	menu default
	kernel /live/vmlinuz
	append initrd=/live/initrd.img boot=live config noswap live-media=removable persistent timezone=

make sure you include the proper time zone info.  
If you dont have linux you can make the live-rw file in windows with the \"casper-rw creator\" found on the pendrivelinux website.  After using it rename the \"casper-rw\" file to \"live-rw\" and it will work the same.  Google \"pendrive linux casper-rw creator\". The first link should take you straight there.

hope this helps.
