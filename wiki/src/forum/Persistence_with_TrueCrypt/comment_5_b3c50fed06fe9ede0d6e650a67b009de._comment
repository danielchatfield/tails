One of the problem I have noticed with privacy live cds is that they don't provide adequate work tools. Sure there is security, but how can you work with secure files with out having some sort of tools to work with? For example I have not found one privacy CD that comes with a LAMP stack (not XAMPP but the full LAMP). If I need to work on a database or with PHP etc... I cannot do so. I am forced to have to use the same apt-get install commands every time I want to work.

by the way. I wish there was some sort of tails customization feature where you could boot into the CD and install to a USB pendrive with LUKS and pre-boot authentication. that would solve some of the persistence security problems. Further, having a copy of TAILS in itself might create a problem for some people. With the LUKS and pre-boot authentication no one would even know that there was a TAILS install on the USB drive at all. what would be seen insead is the boot partition and nothing else. Please consider LUKS and pre-boot authentication as a simple alternative. You can have the full debian persistence feature without having to do any programming or development whatsoever.

thanks.
