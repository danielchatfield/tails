After you add the persistence and boot into tails you can do a:

gksu nautilus

from the terminal to run nautilus so that you can edit your live usb. just go to:

/live/image for full read / write access to your pendrive.

you can even use truecrypt and \"apt-get install\" to further customize your live usb. note: you must do an \"apt-get update\" first before running any \"apt-get install <appliocation>\" commands.

just wanted to add this part to my last entry.

thanks. Anon.
