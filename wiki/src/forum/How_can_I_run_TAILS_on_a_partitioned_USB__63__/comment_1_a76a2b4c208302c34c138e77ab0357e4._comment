My 2 cents?

Installing separate applications on another partition on the Tails pendrive can compromise Tails. Said external application will be controlled by that operating system (in your case a Mac) which may have access to the Tails (partition.

A lot of Tails users prefer a dedicated (read: exclusive) Tails pendrive. After booting the Tails pendrive will be under the exclusive control of the Tails OS.
