Hi,

The firmware for devices requiring b43legacy is missing. If you try to start the device it emits a 'SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such file or directory' which indicates the fw is not present.

It can easily be installed and configured through apt-get or manually (and the device then works), but this disappears on reboot.

See http://wiki.debian.org/bcm43xx#b43_and_b43legacy
