I burned tails 0.12.1 ISO onto a DVD and booted my PC with it.

I chose Windows XP camouflage.

I clicked "System" --> "Preferences" --> "Input Method Swticher" --> "SCIM via xim (scim)"

After clicking the "OK" button, I received the following message:
==================================================
Please read /usr/share/doc/im-switch/readme.debian.gz

User configuration.

Use SCIM via xim (scim) enabled for en-US.

Restart the X session to activate the selected input method.
=================================================

Question #1: What does X stand for? What is the meaning of X session?

Question #2: How do I restart the X session? (Well, I rebooted my PC and after Tails had successfully launched, I noticed that my previous configuration of SCIM had disappeared.
