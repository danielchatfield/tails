Presumably we can't just restrict access to /proc/cmdline to root only?

Perhaps we could pass a hash? Obviously salting it would be troublesome (unless the salt is pre-defined on the iso anyway - can't say I've looked into that) but an arbitary strong hash could be fine with a good password, even unsalted (at the user's descression, naturally). Something like...
