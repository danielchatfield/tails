Plus one.

Minus one.  Newbie posts here are far more likely to err on the side of people not understanding why some on-line activity to which they are accustomed would be dangerous to do while using Tails, and cautionary responses (especially ones which cite the Tails or Tor documentation) are ignored at your peril.

That said, if you simply want to browse the news without being easily tracked, Tails is currently probably one of your better options.  Alas, I can't agree that emailing is something you can do anonymously, even with Tails.  Any activity where you are asked to enter a valid email address is very unlikely to be anonymous.

But I want to address the issue you implicitly raised: *should young people faced with so many threats on-line simply despair?*

I want to argue that the answer is *certainly not*, but it won't be easy.

For one thing, my previous attempt to reply did not pass moderation, so I am trying again in stages, to see what the elements were judged unacceptable.
