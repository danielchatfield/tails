(continued)

And when you are tempted to despair, try to do one or more of these instead:

* join a civil liberties organization
* join (or start) a grass-roots protest, especially with other young people

You are not alone in being deeply concerned about the future, and maybe, just maybe, if enough young people start demanding changes, something good will happen.

Perhaps unintentionally, the Powers that Be deeply distrust and dislike Youth everywhere, because young people can see more clearly that society is currently not offering them a very bright future at all.  Faced with the reasonable expectation of decades of misery unless they take the desperate step of risking advocating for drastic immediate changes, young people are much more willing than older people to make the jump.  That is why our best hope for positive change begins with young people going into the streets and screaming \"enough!\".

And when you feel tempted to despair, it may help to think that you won't give the B-tards the satisfaction.  Their interests are after all served if Youth despairs and simply caves in to the demands of the Surveillance State.
