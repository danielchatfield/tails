@ OP:

As you can see from some of the responses above, some people don't want you to learn why emailing is so hard do anonymously!

Another good place to slowly learn more over time is the Tor-Talk mailing list.  You can't participate without using email, how ironic, but it is possible (if unneccessarily difficult) to browse posts at

    https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk
    http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/

A link which directly addresses the email issue, which I got from a Tor-Talk post, is Tom Ritter's excellent new site discussing why it is so hard to design remailers (a vaguely Tor-like approach to email anonymity):
