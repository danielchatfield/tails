Hey guys just read all your posts so far. Thanks for the responses. That helps a little but it seems you guys disagree here on email anonymity and stuff. I stated my idea when I made this post but so you guys think that's ok and not ok? So why do you say it is and isn't? Is it too complicated to explain? Are you saying email is or isn't possible to use anonymously? 

Like I said I don't know and never even used tails before. Just looking for some simple guidelines like things I can do if anything and things I should feel comfortable doing with tails or whatever. Thanks.
