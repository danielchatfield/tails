I think you may have just set some kind of name-calling record here.  Maybe you should mind your own karma?

@ OP:

I *agree* with name-calling-guy that you should read the Tails documentation, and some of the Tor documention too.  If you do, you will find that none of it says what he seems to think it says, that creating email accounts anonymously is \"easy\".  It doesn't say that for the very good reason that it isn't true.

What *is* easy is to create with Tails email accounts which may *feel* anonymous to you.  But that would be a potentially dangerous self-delusion.

To repeat: my advice is to take things very slow and avoid emailing anything controversial until you know a lot more.  Seek out and read published advice from activists as well as documentation.  Study as much as possible at the EFF and ACLU websites.  Make sure you understand why plain vanilla email is so hopelessly non-anonymous before you try to study explanations of why reasonably anonymous emailing is hard to achieve.

So name-calling-guy and I *agree* in urging you to seek out good information from sources like the Tails documenation.  Where we disagree is that he is urging you to plunge right in and email with abandon, while I am urging you to take it slow (at least for whistleblowing emails or anything like that).
