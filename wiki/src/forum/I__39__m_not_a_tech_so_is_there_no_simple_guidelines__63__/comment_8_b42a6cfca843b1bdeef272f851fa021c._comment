My post crossed with another respondent.  About the question of email, one of the links I tried to offer was this:

     https://ssd.eff.org

You have three goals:

* privacy (you don't want a third party to read your mail)
* authentication (you want to know you are corresponding with the intended party)
* anonymity: this is the one which GPG can't help you with

Another page offering some hard-won experience:

     https://help.riseup.net/en/security

Note again: encryption offers *confidentiality* (their emphasis), not *anonymity*
