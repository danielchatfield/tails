At the dawn of the new century, it would be foolish to deny that we are all faced with a conundrum:

* doing just about anything on-line is becoming insanely dangerous
* it is becoming impossible simply to live without spending time on-line

There are no easy answers to that, it is just a consequence of being cursed according to that old Chinese malediction: \"may you be born in interesting times\".  We alive today just happen to be living through the singularity, which unfortunately turns out not to be a good thing for us, but a mass extinction event, and humans certainly seem to be on the list of the Doomed.

The best advice I can offer is that being well-informed is in the end your only defense against becoming a victim sooner rather than later.  There are many trustworthy news sites and privacy-oriented sites where you can over time learn more about the issues which everyone on-line faces every day.  Examples include:

(A list of links would have appeared here, but this appears to be the problem, even though these were \"dead\" links, i.e. you would have to paste one manually into the browser url pane in order to follow it.  So I'll just say: start by reading as much as you can at the eff.org and aclu.org websites.)

(To the moderator: to avoid duplication, kill the failed attempts.)
