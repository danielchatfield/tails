Nope. Nothing wrong with any of that. Tails is designed for the situation you describe. Don't let the tone of much of this forum frighten you. There's a lot of noise here which largely boils down to free-floating paranoia fuelled by fear and ignorance. In spite of all that, Tails is an outstanding tool and there are also helpful souls around who'll give you clear, concise answers to any questions without bombarding you with some ill conceived thesis of FUD. Tails' \"core developer\" also frequent the forum and their posts are signed \"***Tails***\"

[This](https://tails.boum.org/getting_started/index.en.html) would be an excellent place to start learning ;o)
