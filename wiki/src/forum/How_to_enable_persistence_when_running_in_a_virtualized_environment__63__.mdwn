When I run the live CD from within my virtualization software, my attempt to enable persistence results in 'Tails is running from non-USB device /org/freedesktop/UDisks/devices/sr0.' 
Is it possible to enable persistence ? 

Ideally I would like to run tails from a CD image under a virtual machine and link the running instance to a seperate persistance store.

Another option might be to 'install' tails to a VM image, thus making it easy to use but probably giving up many of the benefits of using tails.
