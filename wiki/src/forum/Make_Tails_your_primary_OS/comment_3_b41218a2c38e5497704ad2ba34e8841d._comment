Perhaps a solution for you :
I 'installed' Tails on a SD card, and set my bios to boot on it automatically.
So :

- it boots on Tails so \"complete anonymity and Tor + i2p + freenet\"

- for \"full disk encryption\", I use a encrypted USB stick aside
- for bittorent, I don't want to use this over Tor (I don't want to use to much bandwith from Tor, there are some possibilities of desanomysation, its slow)

bonus :

- my usb ports are free.

- SD cards have a read-only switch that can prevent your Tails from being altered.
