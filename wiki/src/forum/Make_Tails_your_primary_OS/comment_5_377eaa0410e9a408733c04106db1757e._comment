About BitTorrent: please do not use it through Tor. It harms the network and may lead to deanonymization. If you want anonymous torrent, get some kind of seedbox.

About SD cards: card's write-protect switch is bypassable. The reader can just ignore it. I would just use non-rewritable optical media or USB drive with write-protect switch built in.
