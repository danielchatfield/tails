You better not use obsolete versions of Tails.

Did you look at http://dee.su/liberte ? They just released a new update.

It's a stripped down version, e.g. no Office Suite. You might want to change the liberte images to something innocent.

If you need to get sensitive \"emails\" in and out /evil country X/ have a look at their \"cables\" application.
