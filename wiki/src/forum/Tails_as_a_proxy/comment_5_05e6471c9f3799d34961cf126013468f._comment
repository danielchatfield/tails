Ok. Here what I got.
Run tails in a vm. 
Set it another internal local network. So now tails vm having internal network ip like 182.0.0.1 from Ethernet

mkdir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
chown debian-tor /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
gedit /etc/tor/torrc

\"HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
HiddenServicePort port 182.0.0.2:port\"

So now tor is starting hidden service with the hostname at
/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname


Then 

-A INPUT -i Ethernet -p tcp -j ACCEPT
-A OUTPUT -d 182.0.0.1 -p tcp -j ACCEPT

182.0.0.2 is a server machine in internal vm network with no internet connection.
server is only listening for connections from 182.0.0.1 from tails's tor 
 
So far I managed to make tails vm to ping 182.0.0.2
But hidden service is not working. I suppose I still missing something in tails iptables configuration.

What I am trying to do is to make tails run hidden service and forward it to local network to actual server.
So if ever compromised that server could not reveal any kind of information
