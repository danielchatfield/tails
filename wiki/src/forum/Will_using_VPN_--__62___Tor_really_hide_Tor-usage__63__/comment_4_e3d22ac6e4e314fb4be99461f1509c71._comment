I meant to add to my 1st question in comment 3:

Other than the obvious case of using a VPN when connecting to an open or untrusted network while travelling. It would seem to me that such a practice is extremely common and therefore should not arouse any suspicion whatsoever.

My question assumed a case where a VPN was being used when connecting through one's ISP. In such a case, I would think that use of a VPN would raise a flag just as use of Tor (or Jon DoNym, UltraSurf, etc.) would: it would be seen as evidence of something to hide.
