after filing a bug, I got this helpful information:

- Exporting feature only works for GPG keys
- backups of password keyrings can be made manually by:

- copying the files from /home/amnesia/.gnome2/keyrings
- if you need your backup, put those .keyring files back into that directory, before starting the password manager
