I see no \"real IP\" on any of these screenshots. Where is it?

Assuming there is no such \"real IP\", but merely a country name: in my understanding, this story mainly shows that Facebook has many ways, other than your IP, to try and guess what country you're in, e.g. based on the language you use, the content you post, the friends you have etc.
