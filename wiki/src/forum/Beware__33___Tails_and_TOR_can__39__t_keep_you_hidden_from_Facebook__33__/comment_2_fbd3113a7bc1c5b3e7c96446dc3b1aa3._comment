Yes there is no log as to country IP address in the Security Settings of the facebook profile and it only asked me to feed the telephone number of my country. Yes, it may be true that they have many ways to know my country through the posts which I like and the country of the people I interact with.

Thanks a lot for removing the doubts :)
