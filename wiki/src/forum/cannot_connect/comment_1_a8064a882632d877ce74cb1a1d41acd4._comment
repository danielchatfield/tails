Your description is quite missing too much informations to let us guess what the problem might be :

 * What screen remains blank? Do you mean that iceweasel prints a blank page on startup? If so, it's a know bugs and doesn't mean that you are not connected to the internet.
 * What applets are you talking about?
 *  Is vidalia confirming that you are not connected to the Tor network?
