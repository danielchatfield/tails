Did anyone here try to install VirtualBox in Tails? After several attempts I was successful but I could not create or run a VM. A portable linux version or Tails already shipped with VirtualBox would be a nice feature. If you use the DVD or USB you can run only Tails, though running some other linux or windows os as guest would be really useful.
