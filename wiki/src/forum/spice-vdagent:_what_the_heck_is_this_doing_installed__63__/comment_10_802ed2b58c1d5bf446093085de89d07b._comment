\"Unless you know exactly what it is your doing and why you're doing it, you should leave well alone! At best you're wasting your time.\"

The OP has a point, and why the hostility in many of the responses or outright stupidity in evading the questions?
This is leading me to believe this distro is a compromised honeypot for some government agency. People saying, \"Leave X alone\" while the Tails devs thinks it's okay to whitelist a bunch of sites in NoScript, scroll down and there's more than the ones at top in the whitelist area of NoScript, in addition to scripts enabled by default - what a mess! You guys have a lot of work to do both in development and on here in answering questions if you want to prove yourself as not a government backed front project.

OP: Take your questions to the Tor mailing lists where there is a greater number of people willing to help.

In response to the OP, I believe the actions taken are indeed wise and I share in the sentiment of removal of programs not in use, unless they break Tails somehow.

When I removed this \"spice\" agent, it said it was shutting some spice related event down. From its decription in Synaptic, it doesn't sound like a program I would need on Tails.
