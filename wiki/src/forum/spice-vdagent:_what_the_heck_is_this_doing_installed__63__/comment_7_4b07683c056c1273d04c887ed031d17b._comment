>thank you for the information - i'll add it to my Synaptic markings file to remove with each new session. Yes, stripping a distro down or starting with a minimal install does increase security, anyone telling you different is a moron, this is basic opsec. it's all over the net - the more packages you have the more possible security/privacy issues you could have. KISS. 

How naive... and certainly not correct for someone who doesn't even know what it is theyâ€™re removing.. as you demonstrated to be the case by your original question! Does your bizarre strip-it-out-to-improve-security-even-it-you-don't-know-what-it-is-KISS mantra apply to intrusion prevention/detection code to? Firewalls, apparmor, SE Linux, etc.? Profiles, certificates and keys? Unless you know *exactly* what it is your doing and why you're doing it, you should leave well alone! At *best* you're wasting your time.

Anyway, if you're serious about security you should be using a pencil on a single sheet of paper. Rested on a freshly buffed sheet of glass of course. KISS
