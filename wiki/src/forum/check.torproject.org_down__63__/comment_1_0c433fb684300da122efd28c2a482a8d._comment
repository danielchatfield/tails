Perfect segue into something I wanted to ask, though: did anyone else notice that the Tor network seemed under heavy load yesterday?  I wonder if this could have something to do with the alleged cyberdisturbance featuring Fawktivists vs corporations and governments?

One easy way to check that you appear to be surfing via Tor circuits is to visit any site which reports your apparent IP and then check with any reliable list of Tor exit nodes that this is indeed the IP of a Tor exit node. Not failsafe but probably good enough.  I think the check server is often overloaded, possibly due in part to the growing popularity of TBB and Tails.

* Try http://browserspy.dk/headers.php for your apparent IP
* Search for the blutmagie.de Tor list to lookup the IP; if you can't reach that search for another list (some of them reject IPs known to be Tor exit routers so don't be surprised to find that some keepers of lists won't want to talk to you; that is in itself a weak indication that they think your IP is a Tor exit router, but I wouldn't but any faith in this).

It is possible that https://atlas.torproject.org would be more authoritative but I am not sure this site is maintained, and if you can't contact check.torproject.org you may have trouble reaching this site also.
