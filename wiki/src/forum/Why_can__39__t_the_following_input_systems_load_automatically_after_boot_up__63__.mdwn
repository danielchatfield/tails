During the boot up process, if you choose one of the following languages:

- Arabic
- Farsi
- Russian
- Vietnamese
- Thai

You don't need to invoke the input switcher after booting into Tails OS. You can start typing any of the above languages right away.

However, for the following languages that you choose during the boot up process, you have to invoke the input switcher.

- Chinese
- Japanese (incorporated into 0.14rc1.iso)
- Korean (missing in 0.14rc1.iso)

Why is that for the above 3 Asian languages, one has to manually configure the input switcher and the corresponding language module?

Why can't they be incorporated into the Tails OS vis-a-vis Arabic, Farsi, Russian, Vietnamese and Thai?
