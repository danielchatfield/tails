\"something we want to support......being shown convincing usecases. \"

Um,normally!! using Tor?Often Tails on DVD.
To say mswindows would be secure/trustworthy enough for using Tor(BrowserBundle) is negligent.

Tor developers say:
https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards
\"Thus, choosing many random entries and exits gives the user no chance of escaping profiling by this kind of attacker.\"                         
https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en
\"UseEntryGuards 0|1
.....This is desirable because constantly changing servers increases the odds that an adversary who owns some servers will observe a fraction of your paths.\"

And now something completely? different:
Using Tails.Normally?On DVD.
On every boot you get another set of Entry Guards.
When using Tails each 1,2,3day every time you have ANOTHER
Entry Guard set.
Right?
THAT means:
.....Thus, choosing many random entries...gives the user no chance of escaping profiling by this kind of attacker  (above)
like governments,especially governments
Right?
Normal using Tails without Bridges means a lot of Entry Guards within a short time means really unsecure Tor use?
Logical conclusion?
