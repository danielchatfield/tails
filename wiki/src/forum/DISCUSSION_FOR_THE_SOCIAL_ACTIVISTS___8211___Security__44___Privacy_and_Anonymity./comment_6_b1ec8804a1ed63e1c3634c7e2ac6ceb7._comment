> Any risk if we don’t share anything worth sniffing by the last node?

Never forget that just because you and I don't think our traffic is worth monitoring does not mean that someone else with an agenda we may not fully understand may believe that it suits his purpose to monitor or harm us, for reasons we may not be able to understand because we don't know some facts.

To take a less lethal example: not long ago most people probably believed that their web-browsing and socializing habits could not be of interest to anyone; today I think most intelligent people know that everyone's personal informaton, social groups, and browsing habits are worth big money to data brokers.

Don't forget that the biggest threat to human rights workers not at immediate threat of arrest by their host governments may come from multinational corporations who may have surveillance contracts with numerous nations, very possibly including ones which are mutually antagonistic.  Remember that Spiegel, Bloomberg News, and other media organizations have published many stories on companies (large, medium, and small size) based in the UK, USA, Israel, and Germany (among other nations) which turned out to be selling sophisticated surveillance gear and state-sponsored malware to several repressive and mutually antagonistic countries.  For example an Israeli company was caught selling gear (via a cutout) to Iran.  A US company was selling gear (via a cutout)to Syria.  And so on.

These companies are global adversaries with a corporate agenda distinct from that of any government.  The larger ones have investors who have their own profit-making agenda.  They hire subcontractors and enter into partnerships with still more companies, as well as agencies in various countries.

Such considerations mean that the thread model envisioned by human rights groups should take account of the likelihood of unanticipated threats and vulnerabilities.

> I have observed that most of the questions and queries in this forum revolve around the dangers that sniffing by the last node poses. But most of the social activists don’t share anything worthwhile for which one needs to sniff their data, though they want to maintain secrecy from the government of their own country.

I think you are saying: \"in our country we want to share information which is not illegal outside our borders with other human rights workers; we are not concerned with Tor Exit Nodes outside our borders so much as with Tor Entry Guards inside our borders which cooperate with our government\".  Point taken, but unfortunately the extent of international cooperation by various governments may be underestimated by some.  Too often the reality between cybercrime agreements (there is one between the Netherlands and the USA, for example, negotiated earlier this year with our favorite Dutch minister, Ivo Opsfelten) is this: \"We help you arrest your troublemakers; you help us arrest our troublemakers, no questions asked.\"

If the moderators permit, I will try to help you refine your questions and, I hope, to obtain the best available advice on using Tails as safely as possible in the dangerous environment in which you are doing your human rights work.

I hope everyone you work with also reads these!

> how to burn TAILS iso file onto CD

The Tails 0.13 iso image is too big to fit on a CD, so you must burn it to a DVD and boot on a computer which can boot from a DVD.  New computers probably do; older ones might not.  Even if your computer can read from a DVD, it might not be able to boot from a DVD.

More soon, I hope.
