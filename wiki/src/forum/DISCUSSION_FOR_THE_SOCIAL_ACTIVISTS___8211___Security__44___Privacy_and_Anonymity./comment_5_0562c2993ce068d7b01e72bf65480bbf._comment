It's generally not recomended to use an HTTPS proxy before or after the tor proxy chain; it leaves a dedicated entry/exit point.

If you have to get media out and get it out fast, the best thing to do is set up a system, like using reddit and imgur or an onion filehost and torchan or tormail/yahoo/etc to CC email a pre-chosen group of people.
