> The question arises that the Govt. can SECRETLY ask the diplomats staying abroad in different countries to secretly find out the details of the sender of such complaint to media and opposition or revolutionary groups. How can we protect from it?

Good question.  

These days many (even most) nations are connected by a complicated web of secretive \"cybersecurity agreements\", sometimes negotiated under the name of \"intellectual property rights\", but soon applied to target political dissidents.

For example, bloggers in the USA might not realize that if they criticize the Russian President (which is a serious felony in Russia), the Russian secret police can apparently demand that the FBI obtain (probably without a warrant) and furnish to them the name and address of the offending blogger, who is suspected of a serious crime under Russian law.  A blogger who criticizes the King of Siam, I mean Thailand, which is a serious crime under Thai law, could be investigated by the FBI on behalf of the Thai authorities.

These examples are not entirely hypothetical.  I believe that there have been cases of residents of the USA who have in fact been targeted by US authorities who were responding to requests for information from Thai authorities citing the their law against insulting the king.

In practice, I suspect that host governments may be more likely to act if they already regard the blogger as a \"troublemaker\".  In the most extreme cases, they may collude in kidnapping a resident of their own country for \"extraordinary rendition\" to a country where they are wanted for activity which is perfectly legal where they were living, but illegal in the foreign country.

It is important to realize that no government is monolithic.  When the CIA arranged with elements of the Italian national police to kidnap a resident off the streets of an Italian city, in order to render him up for torture abroad, some officers in both the CIA and the Italian police attempted unsuccessfully to stop the kidnapping, which proceeded without the knowledge of the Italian government generally.  Similar tales have come to light concerning renditions in Canada and other countries.

I might think of better ideas later, but right now, I am not sure what to suggest other than 

* Discuss with colleagues abroad, who may be able to take it up with governments which have some pro-human-rights components (the US State Department in particular seems to have a genuine commitmment to thwart reprisals against political activists, as is shown, ironically enough, by the cables leaked by Wikileaks).

* Try to stay informed about international cybersecurity agreements, and to try to study documents put up by organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders, the ACLU, EFF, EPIC, Privacy International, Center for Investigative Reporting, Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Wikileaks and Public Intelligence.  American based \"homeland security forums\", on-line police journals, marketing materials handed out at spymeets by surveillance gear vendors, and the EFF website are some good places to start learning about the most common surveillance and forensics methods.  IMSI catchers (which target cell phones and are commonly used all over the world) are currently in the news, for example.

More soon, I hope.
