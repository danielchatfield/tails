@ tails:  thanks so much for helping the OP with your own advice!

@ the original poster (OP): the Tails developers know much more than I about the technical details of how Tor works.  I might know more about some of the political and legal aspects than most developers.  

I think it will take a village to collaborate in helping human rights workers and people living in repressive regimes to make good decisions about using Tails as effectively/safely as possible.  This is such a hard problem with so many crucially important aspects!  But I think that if good people everywhere work together, we can come up with solutions which are mostly \"good enough\", even when we confront lethal global adversaries.  Simply recognizing that we all are confronting global adversaries is an essential first step towards thwarting their efforts to harm us.
