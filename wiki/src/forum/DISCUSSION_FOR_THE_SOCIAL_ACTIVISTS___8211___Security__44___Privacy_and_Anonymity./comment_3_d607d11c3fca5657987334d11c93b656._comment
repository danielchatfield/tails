A good website for this discussion is the Privacy General and other sub-forums at wilderssecurity.com, however, security, privacy, and anonymity are three different topics - so, you might need to separate what you have posted into those areas of discussion for the security issues, privacy general, and privacy technology sub-forums at Wilders Security Forum.
