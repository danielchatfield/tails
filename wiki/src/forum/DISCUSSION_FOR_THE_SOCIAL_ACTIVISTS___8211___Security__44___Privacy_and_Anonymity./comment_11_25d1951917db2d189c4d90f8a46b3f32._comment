It is important to try to figure out which specific multi-national corporations may be supplying your government with universal population surveillance gear.

Needless to say, vendors of such equipment (often including software, hardware, and training, maintainance and help desk services) like to say that they do not disclose their customers.  But they are corporations seeking to jack up their share prices and to attract new customers.  They put out press releases and they advertise for employees on job sites just like any other corporation (often at US sites offering job postings for people with security clearances).  

And they attend international trade fairs where they set up booths and hand out literature.  Your daring colleagues in less repressive nations may be able to infiltrate such trade fairs and obtain examples of marketing literature.  To the experience eye, these may reveal all manner of useful information.  Wikileaks, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and other organizations have published dozens of recent examples.

I believe that whistleblowers and people living in less repressive regimes can do a great service by studying these companies and sharing information they uncover as widely as possible.  This will certainly attract attention, even retaliation, but it would be difficult to overstate the importance of making good informaton available to human rights workers and people living under repressive regimes.

Again, one thing on our side is that pretty much the same methods, often the same equipment made by the same manufacturers used by non-technical people reading the same user manuals, are used all over the world.  Many of the biggest vendors hawk their nastyware on six continents.

There is a steep learning curve, so it is daunting to get started but once you know enough it becomes easier to learn more, faster, better.
