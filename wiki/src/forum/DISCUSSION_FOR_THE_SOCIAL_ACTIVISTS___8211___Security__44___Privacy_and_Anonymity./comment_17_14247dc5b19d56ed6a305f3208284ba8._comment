Suppose you have both TBB on your usual system and also a Tails DVD, both with default torrc (Tor configuration files).  If you visit 

http://browserspy.dk/ 

http://ip-check.info/?lang=en

and record results, I think you will find that the \"browser fingerprint\" of default Tails and default TBB currently differ in specific ways.  Many website logs might fail to detect the differences, but a web analytics firm which attempts to track visitors across major websites might be able to tell the difference, and if Tor becomes more widely used for routine browsing, such companies may find it economical to try harder to distinguish between sub-populations of Tor users.
