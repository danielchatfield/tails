@ tails:

Great link!  This comment is spot on:

> It follows that those who fight to change the world will be met with resistance by those who do not want it changed. One does not have to participate in extralegal activities to raise the interest of state security forces (whether those be local, regional or national agencies). Security culture must no longer be thought of as merely the domain of those who might break unjust laws - but as something that is part of the organizing toolbox as a mechanism for community self-defense

Very true, unfortunately.  Within living memory North America was something of a refuge for people fleeing repression elsewhere.  As the Maher and Mayfield cases suggest (to mention only two examples), the refugium sometimes seems to be in mortal peril of vanishing.

I can't find the link right now, but there is an old but still useful essay which stresses the importance of not letting (possibly well-founded) fears about infiltration or arrest paralyze you.  Adversary organizations are well aware that fear of the unknown works in the their favor, but there are some factors which work in our favor too, so the situation is by no means hopelesss.

We all need to try to strike a good balance between taking reasonable precautions (which is why we need to find and share good up-to-date information about the current risks) and allowing adversary organizations to employ successful \"dismay and disruption\" campaigns which attempt to sow fear and discord among our ranks.  The methods used by the \"Corporate Intelligence Cells\" proposed by \"Team Themis\" and employed against Wikileaks and labor groups provide a good example of how such campaigns work.
