I suggest that the comment above is not removed. It is a good example of why some anonymity software developers might want to stay anonymous. Crazy people are abound, many of them think they deserve something, and some will make death threats when they think that they don't get what they want. It is, of course, fundamentally unfair that utterly useless people like these can harm people who actually contribute to society, but life is unfair.
