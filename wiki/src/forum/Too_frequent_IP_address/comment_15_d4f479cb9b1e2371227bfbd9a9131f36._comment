I got a computerclub IP, tried for 10 minutes to get rid of it (new ID, refresh the network map, close open browser, finally got a new computerclub IP. Repeat, and another computerclub IP. I got 6 computerclub IPs in a row.

So it took about 20 minutes and a lot of effort to get a non-computerclub IP.
