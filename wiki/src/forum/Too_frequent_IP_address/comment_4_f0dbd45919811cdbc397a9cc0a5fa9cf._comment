A little experimenting with the Tor Network Map reveals that chaoscomputerclub19 will have about 9 or 10 open connections out of about 45 open connections. After doing a refresh there might be 8-10 open connections and chaoscomputerclub19 might be 2 of them. A right-click, close curcit will close the chaoscomputerclub19 connections but they will soon rebuild themselves. 

Could chaoscomputerclub19 be inviting connections somehow?
