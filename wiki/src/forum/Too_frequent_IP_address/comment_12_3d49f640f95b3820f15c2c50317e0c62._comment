good morning colombo, I wrote before many months that we are spied by tor developers and their network created by american military intelligence. if you are pedohpile, they don't care what you do, but if you are muslim or immigrant against robbing of oil countries, they will use tor network to spy you. CCC is one of their spying shit, they sell themselves for money. tor is created to help to american intelligence to organize rebellion in oil countries, under mask of fighting for human rights. unfortunately, HR activists are nothing else than greedy money money people, ready to sell themselves to foreign gov for money. result is many dead people in north africa and asia. everything for benefit of the US oil corporations who stand behind wars for oil. 
by the way, if you exclude all strong exit nodes, you will not be able to connect, so, they don't let you to use weak servers and militaryy intelligence surely don't use anything weak. I tried and no chance to avoid spies. now I tried to change IP, no chance, controo panel is without stop and start tor, I tried from terminal and I could not restart tor, var/run/tor is in debian possession instead in root possession, and I used chmod and no chance, it is always the same: failed configuration. so, I can't change IP address even with restart and  with sudo gedit etc/tor/torrc and excludenodes, nothing is accepted, IP stayed always the same. including of bridges didn't help, ctrl+f5 didn't help, plus they limited virddges to 2, so, they do everything to spy us. should we begin to kill CCC and similar? they are just 400km from me. they are crazy if they think all people will just stay cool and nobody will come to them with gun. before or later, someone will shoot them.
