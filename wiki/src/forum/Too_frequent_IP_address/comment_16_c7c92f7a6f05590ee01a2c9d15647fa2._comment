FUD: Fear Uncertainty Doubt

> var/run/tor is in debian possession instead in root possession, and I used chmod and no chance, it is always the same: failed configuration.

This demonstrates you simply have too less knowledge about linux/Tor to come around such things. It's a common linux security principle to drop permissions to a user account. If you simply had read the Tor manual you would know that you can run Tor under any user account you wish. Also as your own one...

/etc/tor/torrc
User yourusername

And the rest of your technical issues is also only based on too less knowledge linux/Tor.

Before killing someone, read the Tor source code, compile, check download version is same as source code. If you can't do it, pay someone to do it for you. If you don't like the manual (like you demonstrated) this is also a way to understand the software.

I don't say Tor is bug free, but things like exclude nodes, unlimited amount of bridges (you can request new ones every day, multiple mail accounts, host your own etc.) and so on are working fine.

Tor even allows to run your own Tor network. Tor gives the source code and the network to you for FREE. If you are unhappy with their network you can make your own project with your own nodes. Or you can take their source code, remove what you dislike, change the routing algorithm, ban some nodes and make your own Tor client. What the hell they could do better? You are certainly not of any help with your nescience and killing threads for anyone.
