I was having the same problem intermittently; sometimes TAILS would finish booting but other times it would just hang at that same line. 

Note that I _always_ got that line, 
\"Glib_warning**:get pwuid_r():failed due to unknown user id(0)\"
even when TAILS did complete booting and run okay.

What is the cause?
