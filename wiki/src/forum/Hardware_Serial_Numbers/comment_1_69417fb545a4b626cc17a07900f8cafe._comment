> Does Tails \"leak\" hardware serial numbers?

Generally, no.

Tails \"leaks\" MAC address on the local network, unless [[https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/mac_changer]] is used.

> In the sense that whenever you visit a website, your information gets logged into some sort of database?

Some information will likely be logged, but it should not contain hardware serial numbers.

> What about other operating systems?

This is off-topic here, sorry.
