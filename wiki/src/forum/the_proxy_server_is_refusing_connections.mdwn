Hello!

When I start tails, the first message I get is: "the proxy server is refusing connections". It seems to me, that TOR does not want to speak to my browser. Is this correct?

Does TOR maybe have problems finding my router at 192.168.2.1?

I have never worked with Linux and neither a search nor the "getting started" helped me. I also could not find any configuration gui for TOR on Tail's desktop.

Please give me a hint!

Michael
