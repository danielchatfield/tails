> I like the amnesic aspects of Tails but is it also possible to use VPN in Tails? So only VPN without connecting to the TOR network. If possible, how to do it exactly?

It should be clear from our [[design document|contribute/design]] that Tails doesn't support this use case; Tails aims for maximum anonymity, not imagined. It is of course possible to do what you want, but then you are completely on your own (hint: read [[contribute/design/Tor_enforcement]]).

Potentially everything you've done during a session is \"recorded\" in RAM.
