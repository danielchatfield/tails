Mouse-Over Shadow Text Gone!

NOTE: I reported this bug via WhisperBack about a week ago but still have not found any mention of it on any of the bug/todo lists, etc.

Since 0.17.1, links and images on web pages that are supposed to display "shadow" boxes with text when hovered-over with the mouse, no longer do so. The same is true when hovering-over the AdBlock Plus icon in the Add-on bar; the box containing text on "Status:" and "Blocked items on this page:" no longer appears. Same for the text-boxes when hovering over /tabs/ in Iceweasel.

Note that I have not found the "Unsafe Browser" in Tails nor the Tor Browser Bundle to be affected by this problem.
