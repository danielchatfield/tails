Hi,

I would like to contribute to Tails documentation and translation.

As a prerequisite, I plan to learn using an improved text editor.

My computer experience will in the future closely depend on Tails, so I think that's relevant to adapt my learning path to the tools in use in the Tails' community. 

The toolkit I'm searching for should:

* allow an easy export to Tails' wiki.
* handle Markdown formatting.
* as a bonus, allow me to manage a todo list, and enable links to local files.

I'm confortable with command lines, git, and just started to play with Vim..

Thanks for your input, and see you soon on the dev list ;)

Moritz
