Seen in the Tor message log with Tails 0.8.1.  Multiple instances, 6 seconds apart:

"[12:02:23] Potentially Dangerous Connection! - One of your applications established a connection through Tor to "8.8.8.8:53" using a protocol that may leak information about your destination. Please ensure you configure your applications to use only SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 with remote hostname resolution."

It seems that some application in Tails is reading this from file /etc/ttdnsd.conf.  But which one and why is it trying to do local DNS name resolution?

This ought to be fixed in the next rev of Tails.  There should be *no* direct connections to any DNS server.
