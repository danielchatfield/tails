After playing with this and running apps and rebooting for a couple of hours, no problems at all. Very smooth.

The process did raise a couple of questions though.

1. Is chat through Pidgin always secure (encrypted through Tor) even with Yahoo! chat and AIM? I think it is but just checking.

2. Should i2P be using my real IP address for this under i2P Network configuration:

TCP Configuration:
Externally reachable hostname or IP address:
Use auto-detected IP address (currently unknown) if we are not firewalled

(Although it says currently unknown now, before reboot it showed my real IP adddress. Now, after double checking, the real IP is there again. Does i2P broadcast that at all? Problem or not?
