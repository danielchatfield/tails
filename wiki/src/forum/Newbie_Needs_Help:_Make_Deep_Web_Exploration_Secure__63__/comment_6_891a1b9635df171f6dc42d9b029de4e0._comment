There are many security issues to consider. Make sure you encript any saved information securely. Perhaps don't save any information at all, you may be forced to reveal the encription key. Remember you could implement all the security features you wanted and \"they\" would still get you if they wanted to. You only need a reason for them to park a TEMPEST van outside your flat and anything you do on your computer will be observed and encription keys obtained. What would a reason be? Well your file may contain a criminal record, you may have associated with someone who is being watched, you may even have taken a piss on the rose bed of some high and mighty official and caused it to wilt, good enough reason to lock you up and throw away the key
