Fair enough.

I believe you're talking of JavaScript. Tails never allowed Java.

Sorry to nitpick, but the ability to forbid JavaScript was always
present in Tails: Firefox / iceweasel offers this natively.
What's new in Tails 0.10 is that this is now a two-clicks thing.

Sure. I very well understand security considerations can make the
difference between \"user X uses Tails\" and \"user X uses
a stronger tool\". Please keep in mind, too, that usability
considerations can make the difference between \"user Y uses
Tails\" and \"user Y uses a weaker tool\".

Sure. I was *not* referring to ideas I would merely disagree with.
Bye \"FUD, lies and misleading statement\", I was referring to
**plain wrong facts** that have been spread about Tails,
generally with sarcastic and/or condescending tone. That is what
I call FUD, that can easily and uselessly drain much energy of
ours, and it belongs neither to what is welcome on this forum,
nor to what I'm in the mood of spending too much time on.
