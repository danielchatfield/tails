I am by no means qualified to answer this, but from what I can gather exit nodes can see the content of the stream, however that would have to be linked back to the client tor node some how.

A tor network anonymizes a client by making it more or less impossible to trace a client from the web server, so presumably the exit node also?

If a rogue exit node knew what web page a client was requesting then a request for the same page shortly after at the exit node could link the tor client to the exit node?  (But at this point why bother if it is already known what the tor client is doing.)

Ref. also the thread on identifying clients through screen resolution (etc.).
