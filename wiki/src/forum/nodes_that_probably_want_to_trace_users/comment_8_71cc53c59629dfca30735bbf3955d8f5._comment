@ the OP:

\"As I know it would be a good way to trace tor users by owning manny nodes and maybe furthermore in different countries. So if a tor users connection uses 3 of my nodes I can exactly see what he is doing - am I right ?\"

It a single adversary organization (or its information sharing allies or corporate partners) operates all three Tor nodes in a circuit, then yes, they can certainly correlate your real IP address which your traffic.  As someone already said, with more effort, if an adversary controls the entry and exit nodes, this can sometimes be sufficient to correlate your real IP address with your traffic.  

If a particular Tor circuit is using an exit node controlled by an adversary who is sniffing packets, he can see where SOME Tor user is connecting, but he should find it difficult to guess the identity of that Tor user.  And if you are connecting via https to a website which uses encryption, the adversary should find it difficult to read the content of your traffic (although if you are downloading a public webpage he can of course download the same page).

I second the link (in Comment 7) to another current thread discussing similar issues, including the possibly dangerous use of ExcludeNodes.  I agree that the official advice from the Tor Project is to avoid ExcludeNodes, but I'd like to see more discussion of their reasoning.

In general, I think when Tor users learn more about the possible dangers of using Tor, they will probably decide to keep using Tor, but will more cautious and will probably pay more attention to general computer security issues.  That is important because there are many indications from marketing literature published by vendors of \"remote forensics\" malware and from articles in journals for secret policemen that general computer security issues are probably more hazardous to human rights workers (say) than simply using Tor.
