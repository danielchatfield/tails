>Is it possible for a VPN to track its user's traffic?

Can't see how that *wouldn't* be possible.

But if using Tails, a VPN should only be able to see that you are using Tor.

Regarding ip-check.info, it doesn't use HTTP*S*, so I don't see what could stop an exit node from MITM or otherwise intercepting/injecting, thereby poisoning the purported results.
