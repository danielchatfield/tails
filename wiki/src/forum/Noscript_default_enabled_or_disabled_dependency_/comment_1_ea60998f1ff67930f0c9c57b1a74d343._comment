I see no such checkbox. I see a checkbox to enable or disable
JavaScript, though, so I'll assume you're confusing Java and
JavaScript, and were actually meaning JavaScript in this post.
(Which makes me slightly doubt you're actually doing the right
thing to achieve what you really want, but well.)

The NoScript icon tells you whether scripts on the current page
were all or partially allowed or forbidden, so it's not
surprising it displays different results depending on whether
a page is loaded or not. Also, to get useful experimental
results, I suggest changing only *one* part of the setup at
a time :)
