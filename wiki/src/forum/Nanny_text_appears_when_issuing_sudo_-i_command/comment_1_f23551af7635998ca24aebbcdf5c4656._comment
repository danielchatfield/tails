Tails handles administrative privileges differently than your typical Linux distro (or even typical Linux *Live* distro). Because of Tails shows a custom sudo lecture text, which points to the relevant documentation explaining this, when a user tries to do something which isn't allowed. How can removing that sudo lecture make anything better?
