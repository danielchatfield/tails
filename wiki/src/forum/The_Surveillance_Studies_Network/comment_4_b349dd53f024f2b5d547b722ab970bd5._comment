Yes, a forum designed exclusively to discuss Tails, this is not a general privacy forum.

> Before you concoct another paranoid hypothesis

Care to point out where I made a paranoid hypothesis?


> I do not have any connection with the book either

I never assumed you did

and that's fine, I'm not arguing that the book in question is bad, just that an advertisement for it doesn't belong in this forum.
