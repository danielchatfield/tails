@ the OP:

Thanks, great link!

For anyone who doesn't know: Susan Landau is a respected privacy researcher whose comments have often been featured by Wired Threat Level, the EFF, and other sites which often feature privacy-related information.

@ 2:

Do you know what forum you are in?  The OP was in my opinion more than justified in bringing this book to our attention.  Before you concoct another paranoid hypothesis, I do not have any connection with the book either, just interested in privacy issues long enough to recognize her name.
