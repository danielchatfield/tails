The moderator closed another thread here, on stylometry deanonymization attacks, in which an experimental software called Anonymouth was mentioned, but added

> Please, someone, *help fix the free anti-stylometry software situation on GNU/Linux*, and then I'm happy discussing how it could be included in Tails.

If I might try to rephrase:

> Calling all gifted/experienced open source software developers! The open-source software movement badly needs an anti-stylometry software package similar to Anonymouth, a package which can be incorporated with reasonable effort into the Tails Project (and others).

I echo that plea.  I can't start such a project, but I can contribute some linguistic/statistical material which could be useful.  I'd like to discuss in this forum (if the moderator will permit this), how someone like me can perhaps consider to use i2p to anonymously share material with the developers of the still hypothetical (?) project to develop an open-source Debian package something like Anonymouth.

@ the moderator: trying to be part of the solution, not part of the problem, as I hope you appreciate.
