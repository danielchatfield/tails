I see myself making a simple remaster, or spin, with each new version of Tails.

Here is what I would like to do:

1. Remove the current DE and use a simple window manager

2. Add+/-Remove certain packages

3. Add an IRC client and torrify it.

4. Totally remove all GVFS and extra kernel modules which a typical user would never use

and some other things, I saw the build page is this what I must do or is there an easier way to do it? I would like to stay current with Tails releases and not be in competition with, but compliment Tails. Thank you.
