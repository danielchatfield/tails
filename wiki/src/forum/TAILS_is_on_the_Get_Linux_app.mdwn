Just wanted to point out that TAILS is available thru the Get_Linux app, available here:

http://get-linux.net/


you can download on the webpage i guess but they also have this cool little portable Windows app for now(hopefully they'll make a Linux app later).
they have 143 different Linux OSes available currently. Unfortunately they haven't updated to version 0.13 for TAILS yet for some reason.
