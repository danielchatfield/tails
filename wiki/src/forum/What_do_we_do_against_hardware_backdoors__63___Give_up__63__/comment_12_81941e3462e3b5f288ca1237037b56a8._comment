Stating that a question related to hardware backdoors (legitimate for the average tails user who *is not* a hacker, but a user) is a moronic (quoting) as like telling a passsenger aboard a plane worried about sudden turbulences that it's none of her fucking business, that he should go learn some aerodynamics or go ask the autopilot.

Second : a hardware backdoor is most certainly not \"just a backdoor\" in a CPU core. It's a chain of defects or side effects that can be assumed to be present in statistically significant numbers (cores, controllers (esp. network controllers),...) and exploited in conjunction with one another.

Anyway, for the question's asker, please explore defcon's online archive, you'll find plenty to get started on this topic.

Topic which should really have a section in the Tails FAQ, even if only to state that it's not Tails' concern, and point to some links.
