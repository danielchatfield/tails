> Not true. Texas, Germany, Much of S. E. Asia... not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with stuff made in China of course. Much of it is excellent. But you know that already. If you want something backdoored, buy USA.

The majority of all sources say otherwise. Just google for hardware backdoor, usa government hardware backdoor, military backdoor.

> If it's a p 100 cpu you're after, there are plenty on ebay.

Doesn't solve the trust problem.

>>    Backdoor in hardware = Tails can not provide anonymity

>>>Backdoor in hardware = Software can not provide anonymity

>>>Fixed that for you! Not specific to Tails

This is absurd. Imagine a world, where we knew we are all infected with state sponsored malware or hardware backdoor. What would be the point of Tails?

Some things work so closely together that you cant say someone else is responsible.

Imagine a restaurant where a guest complaints about ill meat. You say go complain to the butcher? Not a restaurant specific problem.
