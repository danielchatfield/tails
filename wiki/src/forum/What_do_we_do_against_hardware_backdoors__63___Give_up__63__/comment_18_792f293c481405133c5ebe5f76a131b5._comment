@comment14: The answers to this round of question of yours are... in the links I took time to provide in comment 13. Please read them.

@comment15: I understand how it can be irritating to see comments such as comment14, but please, let's try to keep this place a friendly one. I suggest we (you, I, anyone else) refrain from commenting on posts where we don't feel able to reply nicely: someone else may very well manage to express the same idea as yours, in a better way, a few hours later. Thanks for helping, anyway!
