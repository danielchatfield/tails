>No. It's China. Who was the biggest idiot who put all the production into China? I tell you this is what gets us killed.

I can't post URLs here to news articles reporting that the US government keeps complaining about its servers having been hacked or compromised and they traced all the illegal hacking activities to some parts of China. Some news articles report that big US private companies have also been compromised by hackers in China.

(Please try Google for such articles)

Thanks, OP, for making us aware of the real threats posed by having hardware manufactured in China.
