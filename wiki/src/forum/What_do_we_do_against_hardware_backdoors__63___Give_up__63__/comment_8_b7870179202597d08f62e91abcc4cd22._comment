>The majority of all sources say otherwise. Just google for hardware backdoor, usa government hardware backdoor, military backdoor.

A \"Google poll\"? Must we? The majority of the English speaking conspiracy theorist nut-jobs would appear to be American then. So?

>>If it's a p 100 cpu you're after, there are plenty on ebay.

>Doesn't solve the trust problem.

Then why did you (OP) bring it up?!

>This is absurd. Imagine a world, where we knew we are all infected with state sponsored malware or hardware backdoor. What would be the point of Tails?

This is absurd. Let's not, eh? Lets try to remain in the *real* world.

>Some things work so closely together that you cant say someone else is responsible.

NOT THE CASE. Whoever's responsible is responsible. **Neither the Tails project nor the Tails community is responsible for *your* hardware**

>Imagine a restaurant where a guest complaints about ill meat. You say go complain to the butcher? Not a restaurant specific problem.

This is absurd. Let's not, eh? Lets try to remain in the *real* world.

>>The resources of this project are finite. If you'd like to produce such a page yourself however,

>I don't have the skills.

**THEN LEARN**

...and which would you rather, by the way, become skilled at something and in so doing, allow others to get on with useful things (like developing Tails) **OR** remain a moron and sap the resources of a project you **claim** to \"need\"?

\"don't have the skills\" or \"can't be arsed\"?
