>I have always avoided buying network equipment made by Huawei and ZTE.

Re. All this off-topic paranoia about not buying Huawei, the US gov says... and so on:

1. Not related to tails IN ANY WAY

2. **You** don't run that sort of equipment

3. Huawei make stuff generally better than Cisco and almost certainly *more* secure. You weren't expecting that, were you.

4. Cisco is a US corporation and the US economy is borked. US gov want the world to use Cisco crap.

As you're such a fiend on Google, Google `protectionism`

**None of this is related to tails IN ANY WAY**

Can we please keep the Tails forum to Tails. PLEASE
