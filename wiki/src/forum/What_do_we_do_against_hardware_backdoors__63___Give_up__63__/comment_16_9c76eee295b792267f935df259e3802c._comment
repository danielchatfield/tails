1.) Comments 10, 11 and 12 make quite valid points.

I have no idea how much of a threat hardware/firmware backdoors actually present but certainly, such a threat, *if present and successfully implemented*, would all-but-certainly greatly-- if not completely-- defeat the very purpose of using Tails in the first place.

2.) Regarding the question of hardware made in China: I would think that, If nothing else, *if you happen to be a dissident of the Chinese regime*, then it would make sense to be particularly concerned about anything made in that country. Wouldn't this be rather obvious?

(Likewise with dissidents of any other country for hardware made in *that* country.)
 
3.) @15: Even if your basic admonishments are in place, your tone is way too harsh. Please calm down. We all need to remember that all of us, i.e., anyone with an interest and certainly a *need* for a product such as Tails, have a common, shared interest and concern. We need to cooperate and overlook petty differences as much as possible.

4.) 
>please explore defcon's online archive, you'll find plenty to get started on this topic.

How accessible is that to a typical user with limited tech knowledge?

(I also don't see an actual link.)
