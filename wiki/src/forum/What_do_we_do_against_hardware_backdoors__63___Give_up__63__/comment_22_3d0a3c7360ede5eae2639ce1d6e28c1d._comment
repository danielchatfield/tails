@tails : thx (comment12 here). That was a gentle(wo)man's answer.

I landed on this discussion, by chance, because it was the most visible in my search results(something like any john does' : \"tails hardware backdoor issues\").

I by no means wish to be superficially critical of Tails (which has become my favorite flavor of debian, and to me this means alot), only to assert that there's a lot of FUD pertaining to HW backdoors, and that even most *decent enough* linux users like myself just begin to scratch the surface (learning) about that topic.

The less educated one is on these matters (me definitely included)... the more FUD. Dunno if the idea is even \"fine\", it just struck me as non trivially dismissible, as argued by the two main commenters in this thread (whose points i don't really get, in the end).

And I think i'll join the translation team, if only to review at first. Thx for the awesome job you're all doing, and apologies if the tone of my comment sounded/was... nooby.
