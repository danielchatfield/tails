Roger Dingledine's September status report is worth reading:

* <http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Dec-2012/msg00043.html>

I think I see some faint echoes of points which have been raised in this forum (not because he got his ideas here, but because these points are well appreciated by people who often talk with human rights advocates):

> I met a nice man who worked for a telco/DPI company that deploys its products in the Middle East. He raised a compelling argument: \"Look, you folks are the ones that mandated backdoors in the telco equipment we produce, using the term 'lawful intercept'. And now you're surprised and upset when bad people use these same backdoors? You made us build it that way!\" It certainly is easier for officials in countries like Germany to think of the world as divided between \"good\" places and \"bad\" places, but it sure isn't that simple.

> I found myself in the curious position of preparing a talk for serious crypto people, to try to give them some research topics they can grapple with, and then having a few of them derail the conversation by arguing that deployment and incentive questions are the most pressing problems Tor sees, not anonymity research questions. I think that's probably true, but it doesn't mean that crypto people are the right ones to tackle those questions. I'm increasingly pessimistic that the 'serious crypto people' have much to offer real-world security research.

Here we can perhaps go a little further:

* Spying is spying is spying; the U.S. is foolishly leading the whole world down a path leading to an endess war by all governments on all the peoples of the world, in which all citizens everywher are under suspicion by all governments at all times.

* Software developers who insist on focusing on narrow technical problems to the exclusion of all legal, social, or political background issues, are likely to wind up focusing on the wrong technical problems, or to devise tools which are outdated before they are even released.  \"Serious projects\" should try to recruit contributors with a range of relevant knowledge and talents.
