> Topic which should really have a section in the Tails FAQ, even if only to state that it's not Tails' concern, and point to some links.

Thanks for the suggestion. Currently, Tails has no FAQ. The Q&A website that will [[replace this forum|todo/improve_the_forum]] will serve as one. In the meantime, see [[how to contribute to the documentation|contribute/how/documentation]] to implement your fine idea.
