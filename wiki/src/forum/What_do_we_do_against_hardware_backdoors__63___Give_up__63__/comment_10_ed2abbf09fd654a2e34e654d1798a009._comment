Use your favorite search engine and language. That most stuff is produced in China is a fact.

If you read the first post the p 100 was used an example that even hardware which is years old can not be created at home. You can create your own bike, car, house from scratch. Raw material and knowledge is available. No one but companies can build cpus.

> This is absurd. Let's not, eh? Lets try to remain in the real world.

Just saying you should reconsider your arguments they are really strange.

> NOT THE CASE. Whoever's responsible is responsible. Neither the Tails project nor the Tails community is responsible for your hardware

Not responsible for the hardware as such but responsible for the documentation and education part.

> THEN LEARN

This is a forum. Tails is asking for feedback. I am providing feedback. 

Encouraging to contribute is fine. Please don't expect everyone reporting a problem to solve it.

When I report that the meat is ill in the restaurant I want them to fix it and not to be told that I should help the cook. Asking if I like to help is okay. They do their job and I do my job.

> ...and which would you rather, by the way, become skilled at something and in so doing, allow others to get on with useful things (like developing Tails)

Tails team working in day jobs or whatever and working volunteer creating Tails.

Everyone should work at least a few hours voluntarily if work time and family allow to create a better world. I am active in the real world activism and technicals isn't exactly my talent.

Whats your part? Hanging around in tails forum every day playing the anonymous moderator knowing better than everyone which topic is tails related and which not?

You are just filling up the forum with pointless posts about being tails related or not. Let the moderators keep care on that. You have no administrative power. Apply. Maybe they agree with your judgements and you will be promoted to the new tails related not related jury.
