You dont have the power to decide. Just reminding. You are only a anonymous no one like everyone else.

> Can we please keep the Tails forum to Tails. PLEASE

I think this sort of stuff falls way outside the scope of the project. Tails is a Linux distro providing software tools not keep the Tails forum to Tails. The resources of this project are finite. If you'd like to keep the Tails forum to Tails, produce such forum yourself however, I'm sure we'd be happy to look it over.
