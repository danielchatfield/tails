>1.) Comments 10, 11 and 12 make quite valid points.

Wrong. 

Comment 10 is just banging on obliviously trying to force something UNRELATED TO TAILS to become related to Tails by his will. A sort of modern Cannute?

Comment 11 doesn't even pretend to be offering an answer or even \"making a point\" it's pure hypocrisy and sarcasm. 

Comment 12 begins with what appears to be a sarcastic misquote and ends with a suggestion of where you might take this crap. Perhaps you should do that, as you have deemed it \"valid\"

>I have no idea how much of a threat hardware/firmware backdoors actually present but certainly, such a threat, if present and successfully implemented, would all-but-certainly greatly-- if not completely-- defeat the very purpose of using Tails in the first place.

Indeed. Perhaps you should go and educate yourself then.

>2.) Regarding the question of hardware made in China: I would think that, If nothing else, if you happen to be a dissident of the Chinese regime, then it would make sense to be particularly concerned about anything made in that country. Wouldn't this be rather obvious?

This is the Tails forum. It is for discussions specific to Tails. You seem to be pretending that this means it's an open sounding-board for ill-educated and naive conspiracy theorists. As you have been told many times already: THIS IS NOT THE CASE

>3.) @15: Even if your basic admonishments are in place, your tone is way too harsh. Please calm down. We all need to remember that all of us, i.e., anyone with an interest and certainly a need for a product such as Tails, have a common, shared interest and concern. We need to cooperate and overlook petty differences as much as possible.

You don't agree so you single that comment out for some quasi-admonishment?!

The crap you are spouting is not helpful and not welcome. IS THAT CLEAR ENOUGH?

But you don wanna believe nasty anon? [READ THIS](https://tails.boum.org/forum/)

>>please explore defcon's online archive, you'll find plenty to get started on this topic.

>How accessible is that to a typical user with limited tech knowledge?

This question is not about Tails. It is not appropriate for this forum. Please ask it somewhere appropriate or find out for yourself!
