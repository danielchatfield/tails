@ \"Tails\":

* will the Q&A website allow posters by unregistered users?  if not, a good portion of the user base may be locked out

* so there is no way to anonymously suggest additions to the documentation pages, except by posting a thread here (until this forum goes away)?

There are some worthy items on the todo list.  For what it's worth, I don't think rushing to replace this forum should be at the top of the list, especially not if the alternatives mean locking out Tails users.
