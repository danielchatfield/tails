> My best guess is that you are hinting that if I want to submit a suggested contribution to the Tails documentation, which would be a public document anyway, I might as well post the suggestion in a new thread in this forum. Is that right?

It's right I was suggesting you implement your fine idea yourself.
It's not correct I was suggesting to use the forum as a documentation writing platform:
IMHO it's a very bad tool for this task.

Quoting [[the linked paged|contribute/how/documentation]]:
\"Documentation writers coordinate themselves using our usual
[[development communication channels|contribute/talk]].\"

Your initial proposal is unlikely to be perfect, so we'll have to
give feedback to *someone*. Pick yourself a pseudonym, and then
we can get back to you. Email is about pseudonyms, which provide
a great way to achieve this need. I'm sorry this is not
*anonymous*, but it's the way contributing to Tails
currently works.

Personally, I find it efficient and enjoyable: we can build
relationship, trust, community etc. upon pseudonyms, but it's
very hard to do this with anonym contributions.

Anyhow, this is getting totally outside of this forum post's scope...
