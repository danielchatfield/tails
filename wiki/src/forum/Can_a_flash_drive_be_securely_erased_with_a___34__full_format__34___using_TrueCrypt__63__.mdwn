I created a [["guide" with questions|/doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion/discussion/]] on a discussion page of an article [the guide was deleted and I didn't save a copy]. Perhaps we could create a guide for secure deletion of flash media.

##TrueCrypt vs shred

I was thinking that TrueCrypt would be sure to overwrite every bit because it has to create a usable container but I suppose the function of writing random data to the entire partition is not so essential to the container working properly; the overwrite isn't the part that is tested by using the container. Is the shred command as certain as TrueCrypt to overwrite the entire device? Is shred actully trying to leave data on the device or is it more like writing a series of files to certain sectors then deleting them so that the wear-leveling may not fill up the entire partition?

##TrueCrypt vs other drive encryption

TrueCrypt partitions look "random" and contain no "metadata" but it requires a boot parameter to run in Tails. Does the built-in drive encryption overwrite every bit on a partition such that it could be used for quick "secure deletion" or to **help destory the burned in data** while allowing the drive to be usable? The metadata area would not be overwritten randomly but maybe this is a good comprimise for those who could use a drive encrypted this way.
