The Tails project contains Tor, which is the central program by which Tails is marketed, used, and enjoyed.

I've read comment after comment where users are told not to post about Tor here. This is wrong.

Visit any other distro's forums and the users are talking about the distro, which includes what is installed and what can be installed, they aren't told to shuffle off when they ask about a central component/feature of the distro.

I believe all posts about Tor here, so long as they are related to the use of Tails and not TBB or other methods, should be allowed - encouraged!

In addition, the Tails developers tweak Tor in certain ways, correct?

Please be more tolerant of posts containing questions and comments about Tor, so long as they are Tails related. Thrusting our heads in the sand and blacklisting Tor discussion here as they relate to Tails is wrong.

Thank you active Tails developers and users fielding questions and hosting a forum for Tails users. Happy Holidays and peace to the Middle East.
