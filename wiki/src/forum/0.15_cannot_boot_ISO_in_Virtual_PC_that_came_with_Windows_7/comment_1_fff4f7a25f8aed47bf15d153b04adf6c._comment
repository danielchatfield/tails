Virtual PC is a virtualization program designed exlusively for running Windows OS's.

It is not designed to, and will not allow you to run any non-microsoft OS's.

If you want to use tails with virtualization then I'd recommend that you download and run [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) instead.
