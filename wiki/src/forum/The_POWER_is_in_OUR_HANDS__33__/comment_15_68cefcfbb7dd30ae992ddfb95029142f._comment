The disagreement may simply be a confusion over the term \"secure-apt\". I was referring to a Debian package which encrypts the downloads:

http://packages.debian.org/stable/apt-transport-https

Anyone who thinks that in Debian stable apt automatically encrypts downloads should try using Wireshark on your PC running Debian stable while using apt to upgrade a package.
