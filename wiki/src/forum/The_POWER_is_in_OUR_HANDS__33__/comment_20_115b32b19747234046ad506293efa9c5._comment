@ Tails:

Thanks-- that's good to hear!

Different circuits: a major improvement and thanks much.

I am sure I haven't thought hard enough about this, but I expect that anything which makes it harder for sophisticated adversaries to tell exactly what versions of what debs a given \"target\" has installed is good, all other things being equal.  But of course no other things are ever equal.

@ Commentator 2:

Sorry I upset you.  Please be assured that my remark was neither FUD nor intended to spread doubt about a major security vendor.  I simply wanted to briefly mention one example the complex ambiguities of \"computer security services\" in the modern world.  Here is some more information:

From

https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab

> Kaspersky Lab is a Russian multi-national computer security company, co-founded by Natalia Kaspersky and Eugene Kaspersky in 1997...Kaspersky Lab ranks fourth in the global ranking of antivirus vendors.

https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Eugene_Kaspersky

> Kaspersky graduated from the Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, an institute co-sponsored by the Russian Ministry of Defence and the KGB, in 1987. Kaspersky then worked at a multi-discipline scientific research institute until 1991.

(The Wikipedia article doesn't explain further, but I believe that Kaspersky admits that in his first job, he worked on cryptology while serving as military intelligence officer; however, he denies ever working for the KGB.)
 
Recently Wired published a piece speculating about the extent of Kasperky's cooperation with the Russian government.  From

http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/07/ff_kaspersky/all

> Kaspersky’s rise is particularly notable—and to some, downright troubling—given his KGB-sponsored training, his tenure as a Soviet intelligence officer, his alliance with Vladimir Putin’s regime, and his deep and ongoing relationship with Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB... Eugene Kaspersky was a bright kid. At 16 he was accepted to a five-year program at the KGB-backed Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications, and Computer Science. After graduating in 1987, he was commissioned as an intelligence officer in the Soviet army. A quarter century after the fact, he still won’t disclose what he did in the military or what exactly he studied at the institute. “That was top-secret, so I don’t remember,” he says.

The article states:

> According to federal law number 40-FZ, the FSB can not only compel any telecommunications business to install “extra hardware and software” to assist it in its operations, the agency can assign its own officers to work at a business.“... Kaspersky says the FSB has never made a request to tamper with his software, nor has it tried to install its agents in his company. But that doesn’t mean Kaspersky and the security agency operate at arm’s length. Quite the opposite: “A substantial part of his company is intimately involved with the FSB,” the tech insider says.

I myself feel that it is a very good thing that at least one large computer security services firm is not under the thumb of the US intelligence agencies, and I highly value the work of the Russians who have analyzed a family of espionage/cyberwar APT malware attributed to the US and Israel.  But the FSB connection is something one needs to bear in mind when reading analysis provided by Kaspersky Labs.

Some say that nowadays even the most formidable national governments are the catspaws of the largest and richest multinational corporations, not the other way around.  I believe that both of these claims have a kernel of truth. And due to revolving doors, incestuous public/private partnerships, outsourcing of much espionage work to private companies (which are now pretty much the norm in many parts of the world), there is currently not much distinction between the private and public sectors when it comes to cyberwar and cyberespionage.  But it does appear to be true that at least in \"the West\", the corporations increasingly dominate national governments.
