I think you got it mostly right.

In Tails, Debian packages are also downloaded through Tor. With Tails 0.14, it will be even done through a different set of circuits than most other activities done in Tails. So, what would be gained in hiding some downloads of Debian packages from the exit nodes?

What would be lost is obvious though: there are no mirrors of the Debian archive available using HTTPS, so Tails would have to carry all the load (disk space, bandwidth, administrative tasks).
