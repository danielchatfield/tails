@ Comment 10:

You raise some interesting points.  I also have noticed been worried by some strangely unambitious crypto defaults in various softwares.  However, it is quite possible that the reason that Tor uses dumb-downed crypto is to ensure that the people who may need Tor most (who may live in countries where stronger crypto, or any crypto, may be harder to obtain, and who generally are not Debian gurus), are able to use TBB (the Tor Project's recommended way to use Tor).
