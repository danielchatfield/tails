@ Commentators 3,4,11:

You three (one?) seem very quick to start yelling about \"trolling\", but this is in itself indicative of trolling.

Secure-apt is offered as a Debian package which encrypts the downloads.  Have you tried using Wireshark on your PC running Debian stable while using apt to upgrade a package?  Not encrypted, eh?

If you are not just trolling and if you still disagree, then I think we need to either hear from a Debian developer or see a link to Debian Project webpage.
