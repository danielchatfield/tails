>You three (one?) seem very quick to start yelling about \"trolling\", but this is in itself indicative of trolling.

Looks indicative of understanding the topic to me.

>Secure-apt is offered as a Debian package which encrypts the downloads.

No it isn't

>Have you tried using Wireshark on your PC running Debian stable while using apt to upgrade a package? Not encrypted, eh?

Of course not. Nor should it be. This is not how SecureApt works.

>If you are not just trolling and if you still disagree, then I think we need to either hear from a Debian developer or see a link to Debian Project webpage.

*Please* stop behaving like an infant. You appear to have a functioning internet connection. If you want to learn about something then do some research.

>The disagreement may simply be a confusion over the term \"secure-apt\". I was referring to a Debian package which encrypts the downloads:

>http://packages.debian.org/stable/apt-transport-https

Packag **apt-transport-https** is not \"[secure-apt](http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt)\".

>Anyone who thinks that in Debian stable apt automatically encrypts downloads should try using Wireshark on your PC running Debian stable while using apt to upgrade a package.

I doubt anyone here but you has made that mistake. Apt-secure offers security not obscurity. You can learn all about it and this important distinction if you can be bothered.
