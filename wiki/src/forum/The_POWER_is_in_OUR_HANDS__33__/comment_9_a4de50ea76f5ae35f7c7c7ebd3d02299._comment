As far as Tor itself, over at the Liberte Linux site an intriguing and thought provoking point is made:

“...at present, Tor appears to disallow “too much” security by design:

    RSA-1024 is universally used as a public key cipher (identity, onion, connection, and private keys, and likely for SSLv3 connections as well; although long-term directory authority identity keys are RSA-3072). This RSA key size is likely inadequate against a resourceful adversary such as the NSA/CSS. RSA-1024 provides only ~80 bits of security (see NIST SP 800-57 Part 1, §5.6.1).
    AES-128 is used as a stream cipher, although this key size is not allowed for highly sensitive data protection in the government of USA (see CNSS Policy №15 FS №1).

    SHA-1 80-MSB are used as the hidden service ID, offering at most 80 bits of security against hidden service impersonation. The security might be weaker than even that, since an MSB section of a cryptographic hash does not automatically inherit the second-preimage attack resistance properties of the original hash. 

It therefore wouldn't be wise to rely on Tor's (or any other OR-like network, for that matter) transport layer security exclusively for privacy of highly sensitive communication. The Tor and I2P networks are, however, nevertheless useful as location obfuscation mechanisms.”
