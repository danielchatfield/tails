You have raised many issues, and I expect that the moderator would say that only some of these are suitable for discussion in the Tails forum.  

I have a few comments responding to issues which I think might be suitable for discussion here, by way of fleshing out some of the topics mentioned in

* Some anti-virus firms (mostly aimed at Windows and now Mac users since so far Linux users remain immune to common crimeware type viruses and trojans) have been accused of undue co-operation with their host governments.  For example, the first job of the founder of one of the biggest anti-virus firms was with the KGB (a fact he doesn't hide).  Not surprisingly, his company offers analyses of the (allegedly American-Israeli made) Gauss/Flame family, but is silent concerning Russian state-sponsored malware.  Similarly, American companies are reluctant to discuss what they know about US \"intelligence collection programs\", but offer analyses of Chinese malware.  Unfortunately, discussion of state-sponsored malware and cyberwar programs is apt to become politicized, generally to the detriment of holding an intelligent discussion.  A recent example of this might be possibly misleading accusations by some US congresspeople about Huawei and other Chinese companies which may cooperate (possibly not willingly or even wittingly) with Chinese government espionage.

* The situation with Western multinational corporations is a bit different: it may be more true to say that Western governments are the tools of big corporations like HP (which has a murky connection with \"Team Themis\", the supposedly defunct partnership between HBGary Federal, Palantir, and Berico) as much or more than the other way around.  To an increasing extent this point may be more and more valid even in countries like Iran and China which \"Westerners\" may view as having all-powerful governments which can dictate terms to companies (the truth is more nuanced, just as in \"Western\" countries).

* NGOs like the Tor Project and Tails are often accused of cooperating with intelligence agencies (usually American ones are named).   Despite the origins of Tor itself inside the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (think Seals), I think the idea of government backdoors in Tor has been fairly convincingly debunked, although there is an interesting reliable story concerning a precursor of the linux kernel to the effect that decades ago the USG may have effectively had a backdoor in unix, and then forgot how to access it!

* Security of systems using Linux with Tor (Tails is an example):  the most significant security threats to the generic Linux users are probably not keeping your system patched and cross-platform vulnerabilities in your browser, which often involve JavaScript or Flash.

You mentioned two old and crude intrusion detection packages for Linux systems.  Chkrootkit is apparently not maintained, although it may remain of some use.  Rkhunter is maintained, sort of, but does not attempt to address anything nearly as sophisticated as \"advanced persistent threat\" malware, such as the \"Aurora\" malware used recently to attack human rights workers communicating with Tibetan activists, or the Gauss-Flamer family of state-sponsored malware.

> how many Linux repositories use SSL? SSH?

Tails is closely based on Debian, and Debian packages are cryptographically signed.  \"debs\" are downloaded (by apt, the Debian package manager, possibly behind a front-end such as synaptic) as unencrypted files, but they are signed. There is also a package called secure-apt which further increases security by using SSL protected downloads.  Once Tails uses secure-apt for downloads, it should be at least as safe to obtain debs while using Tails as to use other methods of obtaining software.

> The fact it takes years until a researcher trips over a particular piece of malware which none of the antivirus companies are detecting is inexcusable.

I think I agree.  Some of us tried for more than a year to raise the alarm about DigiTask, but mainstream media only picked up the story when the CCC was able to obtain and partially reverse engineer a copy of one of their malwares.  Some of us tried for more than a year to sound the alarm about Google's wardriving Street View vehicles, but mainstream media only picked up the story when The Register finally published an expose.  The most recent \"discovery\" of mainstream media are \"catchers\" such as StingRay (a particular brand of catcher which is marketed by Harris, and which happens to be the brand preferred by the FBI and many US police forces), which is even more absurd since these devices have been used worldwide for many years, and privacy advocates have been trying for a long time to raise the alarm about the wholesale privacy violations resulting from such widespread deployment of catchers.  Oh well, better late than never.

> When Microsoft finally starts to show signs of weakness and loss of power over the OEMs, it will try and reinvent itself through crippled hardware and force others to beg at its door for access.

The US Supreme Court is hearing a major case today.  Depending upon how they rule, the court could effectively make it illegal to sell used PCs or other equipment.
