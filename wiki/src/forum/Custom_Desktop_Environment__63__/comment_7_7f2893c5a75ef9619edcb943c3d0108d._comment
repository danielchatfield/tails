I manage my passwords with KeepassX; many of them are too long & complex to remember. I've got to find a way to keep KeepassX installed or the web browsing capability of Tails is quite limited. 
Also, I can't encrypt or decrpt messages unless I can import my GPG keys. So there has to be a way to securely store them on the Tails USB stick, and import them when running Tails.
