I found detailed explaination for Ubuntu: http://www.debuntu.org/how-to-customize-your-ubuntu-live-cd

is there anything like that for Debian?
I would like also cometic changes of desktop appearance and settings in iceweasel, I would like to install tuecrypt and avoid long disclaimer, and if possible to find and install some better GnuPG GUI.
