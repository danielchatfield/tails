Hello to all,
            Love the product however I too would like to customise my desktop environment and save it, to cange it everytime I login would be rather unpractible dont you think? I don't think any users really want to compromise their Tails just personalise it thats all.
        
                                  Cheers thanx for the chance to voice an opinion.
