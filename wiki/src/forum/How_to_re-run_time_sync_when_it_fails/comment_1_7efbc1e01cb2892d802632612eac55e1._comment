> How do I re-run the system time sync from the command line when it fails? As root or not?

Try:

    sudo service tor stop
    sudo rm /var/lib/tor/* /var/run/tordate/* /var/run/htpdate/*

and then reconnect to the network (left-click on the NetworkManager applet in the systray and click on the active connection (the one with bold font)).

> How do I restart vidalia and tor from the command line after that, and again, do I do that as root?

Using the above method there's no need to do that. Tor and Vidalia will start automatically.

> Would it make sense to add a button to the 'time sync fails' dialog to re-try the time sync or at least provide a menu item to re-run this?

Hmm. Maybe.
