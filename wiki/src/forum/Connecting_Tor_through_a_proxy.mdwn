In my job I must connect to internet through a proxy, so when I want to use tor I must type in Preferences the proxy and the port and tor connects well.
My question is: 
is the connection from this machine in my job (the proxy is in the middle) to the tor network encrypted?. So, the admin of this network: can he see what I am browsing or spy me?.

Thanks a lot
