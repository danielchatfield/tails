Here's how I just upgraded my 0.11 USB stick to 0.12:

(Those steps are for upgrading ONLY 0.11 and up (read https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_upgrade/index.en.html )

1. Burn 0.12 DVD, boot from it.
2. Plug in your 0.11 USB stick.
3. Start Tails USB installer - Clone&Upgrade.
4. Make sure correct device is selected.
5. You don't need to browse for an .iso, as files will be copied from DVD.
If for some reason the standard procedure shouldn't work, you can still try to browse for the 0.12 .iso file.
6. It will tell you that your previous Live-OS partition will be overwritten, but other partitions on USB stick will stay untouched. 

After that, your USB stick is ready to boot from again and I can confirm that persistency was not touched.
If you do not trust me, wait for Tails-dev to confirm.
