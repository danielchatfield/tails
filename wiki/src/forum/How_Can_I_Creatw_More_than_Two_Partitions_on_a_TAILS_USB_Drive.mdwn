I am a new TAILS user.  I am trying to create a USB drive loaded with TAILS 15.0 and several other Linux OS's and tools.  I would also like to use the TAILS persistent encrypted partition. I've run into a couple of problems:

1. I know I can run TAILS from its ISO unsing UNETbotin, Multisys, Grub2 or a host of other multi-boot software.  Unfortunately, when I do this, the persistence feature of TAILS is disabled.

2. If I create a USB Drive through TAILS and then create a persiestent encrypted partition, it fills the rest of the drive and I cannot create futher partitions.

3. If I attempt to partition the drive outside of TAILS, (using a TAILS created USB stick described in #2), then TAILS fails to boot (even if the boot flag is active).

This may be a security feature to prevent other OS from running on a TAILS drive.  Still, I'd like to find a work around so I can keep all of my gadets on one USB drive if possible.

I've seen the tutorial on manually adding an encrypted partition, but it was pre-relase 15.0.  Will the steps allow me to integrate the encrypted partition seemlessly into TAILS the way the TAILS 15.0 "create persistent partition" will? 

Thanks for your help.
