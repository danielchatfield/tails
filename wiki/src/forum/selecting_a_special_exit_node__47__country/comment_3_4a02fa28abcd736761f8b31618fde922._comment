> The following URL shows a picture of Vidalia with the possibility/feature to Setup Relaying https://www.torproject.org/projects/vidalia.html.en

This usecase is not supported in Tails (e.g. the firewall would
block incoming connections anyway), so we disable this part of
the UI in the Vidalia shipped in Tails for the sake
of consistency.
