I don't know if this is news to anyone else, or if it's Tails related enough to be a valid post but.. here goes..

There's now a tool commercially available designed to capture encryption keys from RAM. It works over firewire & similar connections.

Obviously it's only effective if it's connected to you (running) machine while you've got the encrypted volume(s) open and the keys exist in cleartext in RAM.
