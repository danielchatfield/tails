After creating a clone of Tails to USB (via VMWARE workstation), when I logged onto Tails, I was unable to see the hard disk partitions. How can then we save our data? Just on the persistence volume that we create? 

Moreover, mainly I use TAILS to access (to see and delete) those files which I could not delete or see in Windows, e.g. Event Logs, Page file, temporary files and cache, which I had to do before taking clone/disk backup of my hard disk to USB drive for the purpose of restoring the same in future.

Is there any method to use the hard disk partitions in TAILS' new version?
