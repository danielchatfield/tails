> I'm running the live enviroment and trying to edit the tor configuration through the Vidalia GUI results in a \"cannot write to disk\" error.

I think that option isn't designed for the unix way of dealing with services, like the situation is in Tails, but it will work for the Browser bundles and Windows. In Tails `torrc` simply isn't writable by the `amnesia` user, and since vidalia is run by `amnesia` it cannot modify the file. For this to work you have to temporarily make the file world writeable (or owned by the `amnesia` user) and the same goes for `/etc/tor/`.

> Editing /etc/tor/torrc as root and restarting the tor process?

I recommend the following:

    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
    sudo service tor reload
