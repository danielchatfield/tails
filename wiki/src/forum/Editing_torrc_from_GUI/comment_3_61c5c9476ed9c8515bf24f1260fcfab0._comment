Vidalia started setting a Tor controller setting called `__ReloadTorrcOnSIGHUP` to false in version 0.2.16 (Tails 0.11 uses 0.2.17 so we're affected). From the Vidalia changelog:

    Sets __ReloadTorrcOnSIGHUP to 0 if SAVECONF failed, which means the
    user can't write the torrc file. Fixes bug 4833.

As a workaround you can make temporary (until next tor restart) changes to \"torrc\" (or really just Tor's internal settings) through Vidalia:

1. In Vidalia, go to \"Settings -> Advanced -> Edit current torrc\".
2. Make your change in the shown torrc and select your changes.
3. Select \"Apply selection only\".
4. Uncheck \"Save settings\".
5. Press ok.
