Editing /etc/tor/torrc using the sudo command, and then issuing a SIGHUP signal (for example 'sudo service tor reload') does not work anymore in Tails 0.11 although it did work in Tails 0.10.x).

When I attempt to reload the tor configuration file, this is what I get from the Vidalia Message Log:

    Notice  Received reload signal (hup). Reloading config and restting internal state.
    Notice  Not reloading config file: the controller told us not to.
