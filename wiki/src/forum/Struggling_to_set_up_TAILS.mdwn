I've gotten as far as downloading the iso, signature, and signing key.  I burned them onto a DVD.  

I have been trying to figure out how to make any of it work but I keep going in circles.  The website assumes I already know the ins and outs of Debian and Linux.

I am running a Macbook Pro with OS X 10.8.  As of right now, I have absolutely no idea what to do to make this thing work.  I have tried going through several different instructions but keep finding myself in the same place.  When I attempt to mount the iso, a window pops up telling me it is "not recognized".

Sorry for being inexperienced, but I am trying to learn.  Thanks for any help you can offer!
