I speak about vidalia icon, if I start it from applications, I get warning that vidalia is already running. so, browser show I use tor, but I don't see icon and I can't change settings, etc. it is the same in USB and DVD. so I think it was problem in downloaded iso file. USB is upgraded on Feb.25, iso file for DVD I downloaded last week but installed yesterday.
