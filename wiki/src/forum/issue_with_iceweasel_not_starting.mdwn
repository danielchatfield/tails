my tails version is 0.12.1 and signature is verified, good

in a vm (virtualbox) tails works fine

same iso on a usb key booting a i386 system result with tails not starting iceweasel 

i've tried english and french : idem

the iceweasel icon appears in the task bar, and after a while disapears.

starting in safe mode from a console gives an error :
[quote]
$iceweasel -safe -mode
Bus error
[/quote]

is it a bug ?
