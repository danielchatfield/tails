Well, y'all noob question. Things are always so obvious when you know and REALLY frustrating when you don't.

Here's what's up:

Downloaded Tails and verified integrity. I can't get the bugger to boot from the CD-RW.

Yes I have read the Ubuntu installation instructions even downloaded the individual CD burning software used in the examples. Nothin'

Burning with "BurnAware" Finally.

Burned the original,as downloaded, ISO directly, Nothin'

Extracted original ISO first then burned on CDRW, nothin'

Copied the img file(from [BOOT] directory, then the extracted directories from original image, nothin'

Copied the img file(from [BOOT] directory, then the unextracted, original ISO,  Nothin'.

Perhaps its just as simple as the wrong burning software? I've been trying the burn as 'Boot CD' option in BurnAware.

Ideas, helps anything?

Thank you all in advance.

Really could use some specific guidance here, as the Ubuntu info just doesn't do it in all instances,I am working in Windows 7.
