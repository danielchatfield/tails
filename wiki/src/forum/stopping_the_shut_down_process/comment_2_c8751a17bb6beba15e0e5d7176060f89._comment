>Does the screen instantly go dark, or do you see the usual shutdown sequence followed by wiping the memory (which puts junk on the display)?

I am not the OP.

In my case during the shutdown process, the screen shows a list of instructions against a black background. When the instructions show that I can remove the DVD or USB media, there is no junk display on my screen. My PC simply powers off.

Is that normal?
