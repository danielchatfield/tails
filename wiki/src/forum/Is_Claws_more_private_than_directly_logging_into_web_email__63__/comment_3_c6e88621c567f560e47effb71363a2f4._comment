No offense intended, but it's funny that people think of web mail as \"direct\" now. A standalone email client is actually the one that more directly \"talks\" to the mail server. When sending mail it even uses the same protocol mail servers use with each other.

But as far as privacy or security, the only thing that comes to mind is that most web mail sites require JavaScript, which many people distrust.
