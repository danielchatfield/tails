Thank you for your fast reply to my last post.  

I want to use encryption.  When I read the following page it is talking about formatting the entire drive.  

https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html

Do I need to use a completely different USB to create an encrypted partition?  If I do need a completely different USB can I just run TAILS live from CD and save to the USB?

Probably a stupid question, but I'd rather just save stuff to the USB w/ TAILS on it.

I'll try not to ask too many newbie questions, but I find this really interesting.  I'm actually pretty computer literate, this is just new to me.
