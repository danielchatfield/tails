Is this safe? 

Make an email address without using your name (maybe use tor while making email address?) using tor/tails to send the email. Would that be safe since its got no id and tor/tails takes care of the ip? Also would being on an unsecured or public network (library or fast food hotspot maybe?) be better or should you do it only on your personal network if you got one or does it matter much? Also does what browser and computer you use matter? Like is there something to do with the mac address or something like that I should worry about when using wifi hotspots or is it just my ip address that I need to worry about (not sure about it all)? I was thinking it would be best to use my own pc as long as I connect to it through something like tails or only through encryption. I don't know.
