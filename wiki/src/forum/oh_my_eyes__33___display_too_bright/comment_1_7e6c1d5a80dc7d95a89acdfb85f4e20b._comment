Tails is using a bright color theme, but I assume you mean that the whitest white is brighter on Tails than other OSes. In that case:

On my computer the keys (on the keyboard) for changing screen brightness works just fine. If your computer lacks that, go to \"System->Preferences->Power Management\" and you can adjust the brightness there.

It is 100% by default, but that applies to most OSes I think.
