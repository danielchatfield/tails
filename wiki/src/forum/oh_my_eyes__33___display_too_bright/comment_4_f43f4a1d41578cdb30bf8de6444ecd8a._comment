To answer the Tails dev question (if you don't notice the brightness try turning the brightness in Tails all the way down compared to the brightness all the way down on windows) , yes I have external keys to control brightness on my laptop. As said earlier, Tails acknownledges this by displaying the changes to the brightness meter. However the display appears almost just as bright if you turn the brightness all the way down. Likewise, when this is done from system--preferences--power management.

Would there be a difference if you turned the brightness down via terminal?
