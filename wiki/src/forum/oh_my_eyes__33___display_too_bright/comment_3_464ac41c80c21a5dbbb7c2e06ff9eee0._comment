I have a somewhat similar situation. My laptop's brightness is normally adjusted by holding Fn and pressing the left or right arrow. And Tails DOES recognize these commands in that it displays a little slider thing, but the screen remains the same (very bright) regardless.

I realize you'd probably need to know more about my hardware to be any help, and I don't have that info handy right now, except that it's a Gateway netbook, which I'm sure helps almost not at all.
