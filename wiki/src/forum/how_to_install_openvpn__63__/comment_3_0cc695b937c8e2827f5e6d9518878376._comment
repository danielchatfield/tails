Why don't you just ssh into your email instead through Tor. OpenVPN is dangerous you have no idea if the connection is being decrypted by whoever is running it or has access to the box hosting the vpn. Yes there is many historical examples of informants using VPNs to read traffic in the clear. Google 'shadowcrew VPN' set up by cumbajohnny which was in reality a federal trap.
