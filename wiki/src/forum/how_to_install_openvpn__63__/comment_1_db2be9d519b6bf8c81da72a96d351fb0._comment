You can do that in the terminal beforehand so Synaptic knows that you're wanting dependency files I believe

but
Then go into synaptic and it'll say there's a broken file. First just click reload. This will take sometime to download all the depositories, maybe 10 minutes. Hit reload again. Then either Edit > Fix Broken Packages, or it'll be self evident to know what to do next, but tors needs the repository and the directory. For this you shouldn't have any difficulty though.

What stumps me is how to deactivate Tor, connect to the VPN and reconnect to Tor. The system seems to autoload Tor on every connection so there is more difficulty/an additional step..
