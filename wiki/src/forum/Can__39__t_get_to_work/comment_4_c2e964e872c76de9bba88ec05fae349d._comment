I'm able to boot Puppy Linux from USB on my Lenovo 64 bit with TrueCrypt whole hard drive encryption. I reloaded the live CD, then reloaded the UBS flash drive. Removed DC, rebooted using flash drive, got same result. When I chose the flash drive, screen flickered, then nothing.

And I checked BIOS. USB boot support is enabled.

Any suggestions?
