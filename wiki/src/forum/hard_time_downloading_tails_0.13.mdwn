hi
don't know about other people but i have a hard time downloading tails 0.13 from location in france
first try via torrent resulted with "BAD SIGNATURE"
wich is very weird...

then two trials for a direct download from a debian laptop via downloadhelper gave an error !

i am now on third try and feeling tired of trying...

to whom it may concern or for any feedback being usefull ...

see ya
