I am a newbie and clueless. My computing skills are so-so, elementary to be exact.

Therefore could someone be kind enough to answer the following questions:

1. Does the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\" get executed every time we run Tails?
2. If it is executed every time we run Tails, what does it do specifically? Does it collect user data, location, preferences, etc?
3. Can it be deleted from the ISO before I burned it to a DVD?

Thanks to OP for printing out the source code of the \"do_not_ever_run_me\" file. But I do not understand what it does. Hence this post of mine.
