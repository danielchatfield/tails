> Could Tails explain in more detail what those testing and development purposes are?

Could you explain why do you care about this script? Do you understand that it's just text? Why are you scared of text? Why do you think that having this text in the image allows the user to do anything that they can't already do? If you don't know the answer to these questions, why do you waste the time of people who do? Why do you think that your questions regarding this script, the logs, or whatever else you find suspicious due to being completely clueless, are of *any* value whatsoever? Do you also read journalists' takes on scientific papers and posit skeptical questions that you imagine to be of any value? Did you try to actually learn anything instead of wasting time of other people, or is your attention span too short for that?
