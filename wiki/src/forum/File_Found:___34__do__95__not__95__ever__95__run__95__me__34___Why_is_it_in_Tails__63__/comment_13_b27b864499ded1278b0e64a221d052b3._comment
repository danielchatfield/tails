An appeal to Tails developers

According to comment 8:

>If you execute the script it turns off some of Tails' most high profile anonymity features - effectively turning that Tails session into an ordinary Debian-based-live-CD session.

If the above statement is true, then it poses a very great risk to users in harsh regimes where using Tails or Tor is a capital offence, punishable by long prison terms.

Suppose a user in such a regime surfs to a website where he clicks on a page, link or picture which activates a malicious script. This malicious script then runs on the Tails session, executing the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\". And according to comment 8, this in turn will deactivate (turn off) \"some of Tails most high profile anonymity features - effectively.........\"

We would appreciate it if Tails developers distribute the ISO with the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\" to users in the USA, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Ireland, etc. where using Tails or Tor is not an offense.

IMHO it is unwise of Tails developers to distribute the ISO with the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\" to the general public, which may include users from China, North Korea, Russia, Vietnam, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.

Thank you, Tails developers, in advance for not putting our brothers and sisters at risk of being caught and jailed for using Tails and Tor.
