>Does the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\" get executed every time we run Tails?

No. There's a clue in the name! ;)

>Can it be deleted from the ISO before I burned it to a DVD?

Of course. You are perfectly at liberty to build your own Tails-based .ISO - there are full instructions for doing that in the documentation. It's much easier to simply refrain from executing the script though!

If you execute the script it turns off some of Tails' most high profile anonymity features - effectively turning that Tails session into an ordinary Debian-based-live-CD session.
