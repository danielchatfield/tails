    Please explain why this file exists

    It's useful for testing and development purposes.

Please explain what testing and development purposes it is used for. Please give me a reason for the user to leave the file alone rather than deleting it with each new session?

    and why it shouldn't be deleted manually with every boot of Tails?

    If it were, it would be useless.

Useless to whom? I can't see any reason for the user to have it much less execute it.

    It appears dangerous to privacy and security IMO.

    I fail to see why. Please make your point more explicit.

It is obvious! Please make your point more explicit.
