>Of course not, what in the world gave you that idea, executing a script on the machine. whether it requires root or not cannot be done without compromising the machine first.

Uh??....I am more confused than ever by your above reply.

Question 1: What you are saying is that malicious scripts on a web page **CAN** execute the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\" during a Tails session *provided that* the machine has been compromised first. Is that correct?

Question 2: But how can a machine be compromised when we are running Tails using a Live DVD or Live USB (without persistence)?

>Yes, you could also get compromised remotely of course

Question 3: Could you list some scenarios in which our Tails session can be compromised **remotely**? Thanks in advance.
