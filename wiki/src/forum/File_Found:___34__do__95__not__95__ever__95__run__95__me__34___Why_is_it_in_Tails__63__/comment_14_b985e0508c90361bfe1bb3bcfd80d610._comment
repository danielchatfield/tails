If the attacker is root on your system, game over, regardless of
this script that adds no functionality in itself. It's just
a sequence of `iptables` commands, that an attacker could run by
hand if they have gained this level of access to your
Tails system.

So, the mere presence of this script does not put users more
at risk than they would be if the script wasn't here.
