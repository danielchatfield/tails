>I think the OP may have implicitly raised a good point

Nope. It was as crap then as it is now.

>although the way he/she raised it obviously upset another poster.

I think it's more how the OP/thread has flatly ignored comments 3, 8, 9, 10, 14, etc., that has begun to draw ire. The (trivial) \"point\" was (politely) answered a long time ago. This thread ceased to serve *any* useful function after that.

>I understand that

>testing scripts are neccessary for development of Tails

Indeed. Although it's not specifically a \"testing script\" and the developers are competent to enter those commands themselves of course. There are plenty of other development tasks for which such a script might be useful.. troubleshooting, bug reporting.. all manner of useful tasks - which *competent users* (who don't necessarily knowing how to manually enter those commands for themselves), as well as \"developers\" (who don't necessarily want to type them all the time) might like to do without. Have you stopped to think about this, or are you just enjoying making noise?

>scripts usually won't execute unless someone executes them

Usually? What strange quantum universe do you inhabit? No code is EVER executed until it is executed.

>few people who read basic English would execute a script called something like \"dont-ever-run-me\"

No. ANYBODY with a *need* for Tails will take a *cautious* approach to their security... this will include **not running *any* ** commands or scripts they don't fully understand - not just the ones named \"do_not_ever_run_me\"

This thread (like many others lately) isn't about security, it's about children playing.

Here's another important warning you might have overlooked: DON'T POKE THINGS INTO ELECTRICAL SOCKETS

>But some Tails users who may be most at risk may well have gotten a copy from another dissident living in a country where English is not commonly used, and might not understand a word of English. In such cases, the penalty for a mistake could be torture or death, so it seems to me that if it is possible to keep potentially dangerous scripts out of the release versions, just to be super-safe, it would probably be a good idea to do that.

Read the responses above. Your imaginary dissident, frantically executing all the code they can find on whatever systems they encounter, with no regard for what it does, will have killed themselves LONG before they get to a trivial little script called \"dont-ever-run-me\" in Tails! I realise you're *probably* trying to help Tails!.. but *please*.. try to *think* a bit too!

>On a related topic, I have seen some posts here (sorry, no links handy) suggesting that some Tails users may be trying to download and live-install things which potentially make their Tails systems more like a development platform than is really wise. I have the impression that quite a few Tails users still need much more education about how dangerous such additions can be.

Yes, there has indeed been an outbreak of messing around on the forum. The vast majority of the chaff is arising from people who simply haven't bothered to read the documentation. Tails' document is outstanding. Anyone with a serious interest in or need for Tails *will* have taken the time to read it. Those who don't are just timewasters messing around.

Of course perfection is impossible to attain, so there is always room to improve something... If you'd like to draft something **SPECIFIC TO TAILS** then, as is made clear in the documentation, [help is always welcome](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/documentation/)

>I believe that the best way to convey the message is by describing (authentic) examples, which gets us back to the kind of background discussion you don't want to have here. Just one more example of why it would be so helpful to so many to have a general privacy forum which allows posting by anonymous unregistered Tor using parties.

Nope. You've lost me again. I fear you may have drifted off into psychosis again. Hello?... Hello?...

This is the **TAILS** project. Documenting the Tor project is a job ([which they've already done - **very thoroughly**](https://www.torproject.org/docs/manual.html.en)) for the Tor project.
