> Are you saying that malicious scripts on a web page cannot execute the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\" during a Tails session? 

Of course not, what in the world gave you that idea, executing a script on the machine. whether it requires root or not cannot be done without compromising the machine first.

> A human would have to be physically present and has root access to execute the said file, is that correct?

Yes, you could also get compromised remotely of course, but if you were then the script would not be that important to the attacker.
