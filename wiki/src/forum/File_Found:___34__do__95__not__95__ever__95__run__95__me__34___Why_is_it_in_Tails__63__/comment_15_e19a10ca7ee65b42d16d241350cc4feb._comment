>If the attacker is root on your system, game over, regardless of this script that adds no functionality in itself. It's just a sequence of iptables commands, that an attacker could run by hand if they have gained this level of access to your Tails system.

Just to confirm that my understanding of what you wrote above is correct.

Are you saying that malicious scripts on a web page cannot execute the file \"do_not_ever_run_me\" during a Tails session? A human would have to be physically present and has root access to execute the said file, is that correct?
