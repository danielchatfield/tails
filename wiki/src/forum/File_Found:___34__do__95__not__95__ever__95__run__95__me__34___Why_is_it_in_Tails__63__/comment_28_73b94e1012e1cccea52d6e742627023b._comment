Sadly someone has \"discovered\" Tails while being cursed with a terrible combination of:

1. An exceptionally low IQ which seems to render him incapable of understanding anything he reads.

2. An unshakable faith that he's supremely clever and always correct.

3. An internet connection.

This particular thread has been a worthless display of ignorance and stupidity since OP. I can't imagine that'll change but it's clear for all to see so I'm sure it's harmless enough. Once OP tires of it he'll just silently drop it to spawn another one in an unrelated yet surprisingly familiar vein.

Please don't let him upset you. He's probably 13 and autistic. He's just a minor irritation here. Before you become too riled by all the shite, spare a thought for how his parents must feel! We've got it easy! It's probably best not to reply when first incensed by the impenetrable belligerence - such replies are likely to be unpleasant for the rest of us too... and that would obviously be unfortunate.

Keep calm & carry on ;o)
