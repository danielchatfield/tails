Are you able to toggle switch ON if you didn't make the steps 1-3, I mean if you didn't desactivate with *ifconfig wlan0 down*?

Tails ships now rfkill, perhaps that can help you solve your problem : <http://linuxwireless.org/en/users/Documentation/rfkill>

PS: I think the devs follow with attention the forum's activity. What you can do is to send them a bug report, so they will get more informations, like your material configuration
