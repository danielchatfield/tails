NO DVD player on the Chromebox, so that wont work - but I will try the other method.

I am guessing UNetBootin and USB Boot Creator both create disks in Fat or FAT32... I guess I should look at the file system that Chrome uses and figure out how to get TAILS installed on a USB stick using that file system.

Certainly open for other options though.. and thanks for the reply!
