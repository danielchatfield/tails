I haven't seen one of those machines yet so I'm only guessing at thing's it could be. 

UEFI bios ? Might have to patch tails to get it to work under the newer bioses.

Umm GPT partition maybe ? USB hardware compatibility ? Guess I'd try using the USB stick on another device to see if it would boot also. And trying another distro to run off USB besides tails.

All I got.
