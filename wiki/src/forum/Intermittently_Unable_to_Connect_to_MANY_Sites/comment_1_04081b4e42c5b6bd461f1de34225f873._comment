So, no one else experienced this?

Thankfully, it has not happened to me since but just now, at around 11:00 UTC, I encountered a similarly unsettling incident while browsing the Tails forum.

All of a sudden, after opening countless threads without incident, Iceweasel started throwing-up an untrusted SSL cert warning, each and every time I tried to open a thread: 

>The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.

>(Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)

I then tried and got exactly the same for several other https sites, including Google.

The only site I *didn't* have this problem with was `startpage.com`.

So I clicked \"New Identity\" in TorButton and, so far at least, the problem is gone.

Pretty weird, huh?
