That could be misinterpreted.  

As I understand it, the Tails Project logs an automatic visit upon booting Tails to the news page as a \"Tails boot\", but of course the identity of the user is hidden behind a Tor circuit to the Tails news page.

Please either

* acknowledge 
* correct me if my understanding is incorrect

Thanks in advance!

@ OP:

I'd like to share information on problems I have encountered in the past year using TBB and Tails, but a free and open discussion may be difficult in this forum; search for NDI to see one possible reason why.
