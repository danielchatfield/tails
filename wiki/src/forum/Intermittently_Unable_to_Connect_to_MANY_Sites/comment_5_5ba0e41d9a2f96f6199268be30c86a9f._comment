Thanks to Tails for replying.

I stopped experiencing the problem not long after making my last post, so I never bothered with a bug report.

I do still wonder how many other people experienced what I described.

BTW, any idea of what percentage of Tails users view this forum?

(and what percentage of readers and posters to this forum are *not* Tails users ?)
