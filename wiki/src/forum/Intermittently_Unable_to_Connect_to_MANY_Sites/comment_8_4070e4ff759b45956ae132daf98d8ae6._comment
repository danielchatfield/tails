> As I understand it, the Tails Project logs an automatic visit upon booting Tails to the news page as a \"Tails boot\", but of course the identity of the user is hidden behind a Tor circuit to the Tails news page.

The server (boum.org) that hosts our website logs visits (without
IP addresses we're told). Yes, this connection is made over Tor.
