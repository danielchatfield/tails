As of today:

* Tails 0.9 is the last version of Tails.
* Tor 0.2.2.34 is not the last version of Tor.

Users of Tails 0.9 are *not* affected by the security issue Tor 0.2.2.34 has for other users. [Details are there](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-December/022381.html).

Just wait for Tails 0.10 (coming soon) that won't display this warning. In the meantime, just ignore the warning dialog and go on using Tails 0.9.
