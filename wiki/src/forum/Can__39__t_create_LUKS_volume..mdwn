I have been trying to create an encrypted LUKS volume.  I have done all the steps properly.  When I have the volume created I cannot mout it, instead I get error messages that the drive is busy or some other error messages.  When I try to format it back I cant, I get the same error messages.  In windows I cant use the drive or even see it because it is in a linux format.  I cannot format it back to a windows format, so the drive becomes useless to me.  I have returned 3 HDD back to the store.  I really need help figuring this out because I dont think the store is going to let me return another one.
