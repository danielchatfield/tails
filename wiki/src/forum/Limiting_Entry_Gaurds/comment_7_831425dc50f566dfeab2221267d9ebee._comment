I believe you can add a line like

     NumEntryGuards 5

to your torrc file.

I often read man pages, so I wasn't put off by the forbidding man page which appears when you type

     man tor

into a shell.  I presume \"Tails\" will correct me if I somehow got this wrong, but it seems straightforward.  I am pretty sure you can put the line I quoted anywhere in your torrc file, as long as it is one its own line.

Also, you might look through recent Tor-talk posts for a post by (if I recall aright) Roger Dingledine mentioning a fairly new paper by a security researcher arguing that 3 might not be the best number of Entry Guards after all.
