\" Edit /etc/tor/torrc, reload the tor service\"

For everbody,mostly NoLinuxUser:
-All in Root Terminal?
-Edit torrc on the running USB-stick?Without changing permissions(chmod ?)?
-Add EntryGuard(s) and Strict...?
-Reload with something like system restart tor?

And what about users with DVD only? Tough!?
