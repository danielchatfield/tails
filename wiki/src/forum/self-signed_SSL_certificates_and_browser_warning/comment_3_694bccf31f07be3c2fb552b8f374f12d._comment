The [Wilders Security Forums](http://wilderssecurity.com), which has been mentioned at this forum in the past, uses a self-signed certificate for the SSL option they provide.

The rationale is given in [an FAQ entry](https://www.wilderssecurity.com/faq.php?faq=wilders_custom_faqs#faq_wilders_ssl_tls_use), which reads, in part:

>The main downside to self-signing is that such certificates are not automatically recognized as trusted by main stream browsers. A certificate warning message will be produced when the browser encounters such a certificate. However, most browsers allow the user to approve the use of that certificate and to remember it so that future warnings will not be displayed.

The page lists the SHA1 and SHA256* fingerprints for the certificate and links to threads where the Wilders admin explained his decision to use self-signed further.

(*Yet, Firefox only dispays SHA1 and **MD5** fingerprints for SSL certificates; no SHA256)

Comment 1, above, wrote, 
>In some cases you can use an out-of-band communication (such as phone call) to verify that a certificate is genuine. 

*When* a self-signed certificate can be verified that way, then I would think that adding it as an exception in one's browser would not be less safe than relying on the typical, run-of-the-mill CA-issued certificate recognized by one's browser.

(But Wilders makes no mention of such an option. This is disturbing.)

When using Tails with persistence enabled, will any exceptions added for self-signed certs be saved in Iceweasel? Even across reboots?

For some reason, this does *not* seem possible in *Tor Browser Bundle*, where the option is greyed-out.
