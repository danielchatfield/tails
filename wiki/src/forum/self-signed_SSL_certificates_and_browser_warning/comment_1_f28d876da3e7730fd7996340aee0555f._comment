> tails browser gives a warning everytime an attempt to visit an SSL supporting website is visited with its certificate being self-signed.

Did you first see that behavior when you first started using Tails 0.18, by any chance?

> Does using a self-signed certificate on a website necessarily indicate rouge activity?

No.  But sometimes it indicates stupidity or cutting corners in security-critical areas.  Many small webmail providers use self-signed certificates, which is insanely dangerous to their customers.

> How can you tell which warning is genuine and which is false positive?

In some cases you can use an out-of-band communication (such as phone call) to verify that a certificate is genuine.
