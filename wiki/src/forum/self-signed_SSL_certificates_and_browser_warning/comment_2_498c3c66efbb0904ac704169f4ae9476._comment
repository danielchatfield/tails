1.) *Self-signed* certs should have *always* triggered a warning (both in Tails and in any just about browser that isn't ridiculously outdated).

To the best of my knowledge and experience so far, the warning messages that are new for Tails 0.18 concern:
1.) Merely navigating from an HTTPS to an HTTP page
and
2.) Submitting form data over a non-HTTPS (and perhaps \"mixed content\" as well) page.
