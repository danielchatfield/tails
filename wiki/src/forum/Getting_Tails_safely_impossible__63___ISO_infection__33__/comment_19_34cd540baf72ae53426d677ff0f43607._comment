I am not the writer of comment 15 or 16.

>The Tails documentation suggests that helpful-minded but non-technical Tails users can assist other Tails users in this forum by answering questions, and many of us are trying to do that. You however, are trying to play moderator here, which is not your role.

I think it's high time that the forum be properly organized into sub-categories with eye-popping user-friendly GUI and a really efficient search function. What do you guys think?
