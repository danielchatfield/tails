> its kinda irrelevant whether antiviruses for Linux exist because the main point is that the likelihood of getting infected on a modern Linux is practically zero, in fact I'd go so far as to say that unless you intentionally went out and looked for malware and intentionally installed them on your system manually its practically impossible for a normal user to be infected, therefore making antivirus software pretty useless.

I agree with you as far as common criminal malware goes, but you have made a dangerous mistake by overlooking some well documented facts:

* Police agencies worldwide have for years used malware to target (especially) \"persons of interest\" using tools such as Tor; for EU standard practice see the recent UN report which quotes from the protocol for internet investigations which was developed by the Carabinieri and adopted by most EU police agencies, which explicitly states that when possible police agencies should try to insert \"police malware\" onto the target computer.  Furthermore, such procedures are rapidly becoming more and more common around the world, as more and more companies spring up in various regions (the EU, the Americas, Asia) which sell such malware.  If you want to search for information about what police are doing in your locale, try searching for \"lawful intercept\" and \"remote forensics\", two euphemisms which often appear in the marketing documents of companies which sell malware to \"the authorities\".  It is however true that the standard methods of installing police malware are the same as the standard method of installing criminal malware: social engineering, phishing emails, infected file downloads, etc.  Regarding social engineering, don't forget that intelligence and police agencies can usually force other governmental agencies to let them impersonate their own employees, in order to target the victim of some (generally warrantless) investigation/action.  So they have opportunities which criminals usually lack to frighten/trick \"targets\" into doing something dangerous.

* Intelligence and police agencies worldwide tend to follow the examples set by US intelligence and national police agencies, to the extent that their budgets permit; this is often enabled by information sharing agreements they may have, and also by treaty obligations which may force the US FBI to share detailed information on someone who (say) \"insulted\" the King of Siam via some US based server with the Thai police.  US authorities recently abandoned their longstanding false claim that they do not compile dossiers on American citizens (and never really denied that they compile dossiers on citizens of other nations), even  admitting that they do in effect possess detailed dossiers on the financial, travel, communication, legal, medical, and educational records of all citizens.  (More precisely, they have copies of all the databases they need to toss together such a detailed dossier \"on the fly\" for any person who interests one of their employees for any reason, at any time.  This includes the content of text messages, emails, and VOIP or POTS phone calls, as well as websurfing logs, username/password combinations, and more.)

* The US FBI has taken the lead in a quiet campaign to reverse the stellar victory of the pro-cryptography community during the \"cipher wars\" of the 1990s (a political battle inside the US), and appears likely to succeed in mandating \"backdoors\" in all encryption for all computers located inside the USA; this alone will have enormous implications for all web users everywhere in the world, but will also encourage other nations which have not yet enacted such legislation to do so.  Following a common strategy, they have been asking for the Moon, knowing that they will in the end get what they want: backdoors into everything but Tor.  And what is their plan for Tor?  Simple: trojan every Tor user everywhere in the world.  They have already obtained the \"legal cover\" to do that, at least under US law.  And if you live in Germany, good luck bringing the FBI before the ICC, although I hope someone will try.

You should be able to find some recent posts on the FBI's anti-crypto drive and the other issues I mentioned at eff.org and aclu.org and some other places, but if not I can try to provide links later, \"Tails\" permitting.
