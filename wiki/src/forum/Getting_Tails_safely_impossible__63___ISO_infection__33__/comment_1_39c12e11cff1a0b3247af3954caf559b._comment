OP, thanks for raising the above points.

I have only elementary IT skills but I will try to answer your points.

For me, I download Tails using a computer that I trust to be free of viruses/malware/Trojan horses etc. In this case, it is my own computer.

The moment Microsoft Windows has been successfully installed, I install a commercially well-known antivirus/malware/spyware cum firewall software.

Moreover once a week, I will use a liveUSB containing SERT (Symantec Endpoint Recovery Tool) to scan my PC for viruses/rootkits/malware/spyware etc... You may wish to use Google to find out what SERT is capable of doing.

So, OP, am I doing it right?

I must emphasize that I will never use a public computer such as the one in internet cafes or my friend's PC to download Tails.
