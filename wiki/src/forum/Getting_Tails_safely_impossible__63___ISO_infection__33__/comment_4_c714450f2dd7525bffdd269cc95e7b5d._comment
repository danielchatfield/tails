I am the writer of comment 1.

The writer of comment 2 implies that Linux OS or its variants is free of viruses/malware/spyware/adware etc. IMHO, it is a dangerous assumption.

The very fact that Symantec/Norton, McAfee, Kapersky, AVG, etc. offer tools for the Linux platform suggests that viruses/malware/spyware, etc..also target it.

Could the writer of comment 2 tell us whether he/she uses any antivirus/anti-spyware/anti-malware tool for his/her Linux/Debian/Knoppix/Ubuntu/Kubuntu OS? If yes, what is the exact name?
