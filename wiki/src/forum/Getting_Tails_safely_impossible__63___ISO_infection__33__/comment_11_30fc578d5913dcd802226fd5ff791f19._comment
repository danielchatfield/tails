> I hate to say this but you're wrong. Please have a look at the following products that offer virus scanning and removal on Linux systems:

Agian most of those products are primarily designed for removal of windows viruses, and while it might be true that some of them is designed to also look for the couple of known Linux malware that exits its a pretty universal consensus among most security exerts that you don't really need any antivirus software for Linux unless you are somewhat paranoid and is running it as a server in which case you are at a slightly higher risk of getting attacked, if you only use it as a desktop then I don't think I have ever heard any security expert actually recommend the use of antivirus software no matter how paranoid you are.

and to be honest its kinda irrelevant whether antiviruses for Linux exist because the main point is that the likelihood of getting infected on a modern Linux is practically zero, in fact I'd go so far as to say that unless you intentionally went out and looked for malware and intentionally installed them on your system manually its practically impossible for a normal user to be infected, therefore making antivirus software pretty useless.
