>because the main point is that the likelihood of getting infected on a modern Linux is practically zero,

That is a dangerous assumption. I will never let my guard down where the security of my computer is concerned.

Please have a look at the following products and tell me whether they are designed for Linux-based systems:

Symantec Antivirus for Linux 1.0

McAfee VirusScan for Linux

Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux Workstation

avast! Linux Home Edition (free to use for home users)

AVG AntiVirus for Linux (free to use)

Comodo Antivirus for Linux (free to use)

For your information, avast!, AVG and Commodo for Linux are free to use.
