>>because the main point is that the likelihood of getting infected on a modern Linux is practically zero,

>That is a dangerous assumption. I will never let my guard down where the security of my computer is concerned.

No it isn't. It's common knowledge among the technically aware that the amount of malware targeted at GNU/Linux is a ***tiny*** proportion of that which exists \"in the wild\". In fact, it's unclear if there's ***any*** GNU/Linux malware \"existing ***in the wild***\". That doesn't mean \"don't be viligant\" or whatever you've inferred, it simply means the ***likelihood*** of getting infected on a modern Linux is ***practically*** zero.

>Please have a look at the following products and tell me whether they are designed for Linux-based systems:

No.

They are all designed to detect (and remove) **Microsoft™ Windows™** malware even though they run on a GNU/Linux platform. Think about it - it makes sense!... Suppose you have to remove multiple unknown infections from multiple **Microsoft™ Windows™** machines. You'll need a computer of your own, of course. Your computer will have to be running an OS, of course. Do you a): attempt to install and use cleanup tools from within the afflicted machines, b): run the same piece of shit, Mickey Mouse OS as all the infected machines on your own machine and attach the infected machines or their drives to your system - while preying that none of the rife malware finds a way onto your machine or c): as b) but running **a grown-up OS** on your system with tools to detect the crap which runs rife on ***the other*** (toy) OS? It would appear that enough people choose c) to support a healthy selection of commercial tools designed to do exactly that. Who'd have thunk it?
