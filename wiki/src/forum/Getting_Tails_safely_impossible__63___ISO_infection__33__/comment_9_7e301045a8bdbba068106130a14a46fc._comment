I hate to say this but you're wrong. Please have a look at the following products that offer virus scanning and removal on Linux systems:

Symantec Antivirus for Linux 1.0

McAfee VirusScan for Linux

Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Linux Workstation

avast! Linux Home Edition (free to use for home users)

AVG AntiVirus for Linux (free to use)

Comodo Antivirus for Linux (free to use)

>Also you do realize that Tails itself is also a Linux OS right?

Yep, but I do use the free avast! Linux Home Edition to scan every Tails distro for viruses before burning it to DVD or USB thumb drive.
