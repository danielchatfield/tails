Back to the original point, there are plenty of Linux magazines with CDs attached - most of which will run from the CD itself.  So if your computer has a CD this would enable you to download and burn a Tails distro to a USB drive or using as mentioned above the 'toram' boot option to CD.

If you don't have access to Linux magazines there are Linux CD suppliers who should be able to help.  I note there are quite a few people who will supply Debian as more of a community service than for profit as well.
