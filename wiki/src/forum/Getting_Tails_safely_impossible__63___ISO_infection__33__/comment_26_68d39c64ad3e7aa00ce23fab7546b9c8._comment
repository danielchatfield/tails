@ Comment 24:

Why the recurrent abuse of the Tails developers?  I share some of the concerns you (?) have expressed in numerous threads, but some of these posts suggest some sort of inept disruption campaign targeting this forum.  

If anyone really thought that the Tails developers were in league with our adversaries, it hardly makes sense to say so here unless you are trying to kill the project.  That's not what you really want, is it?
