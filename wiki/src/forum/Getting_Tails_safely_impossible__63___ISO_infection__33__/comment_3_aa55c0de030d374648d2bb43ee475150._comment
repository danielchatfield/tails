I wrote Comment 2, and just realized I forgot to issue an important warning:

If laptops are available for rental in your area, you might be tempted to rent some hardware to perform checks or even to download.  But that is probably about the worst thing you could do because it is said to be common for rental companies to install keyloggers and other spyware on their laptops.

Regarding buying used equipment: you never know where it's been, so this also carries multiple risks.  If you can afford a new laptop bought from a reputable dealer, that might be less risky. Or more; newer machines might well be more likely to acquire more sophisticated malware even before being shipped from the factory.  Even for well-funded governments, it can be very difficult to assess the relative dangers.

In \"Supervision\", a new book on the surveillance state by John Gilliom and Torin Monahan, the authors seem to say that

* resistance is futile
* futile not so much because you are fighting powerful and malignantly intelligent adversaries as the NSA, but because you are fighting overwhelming economic forces which result in a constant, ever-growing hunger on the part of all organizations for more and more data about each and everyone one of us (our communications, our travels, our DNA, our brainwaves, our physical and mental activities in public and inside our own homes, our presumed propensity towards dissent or indeed towards any thoughts/actions which might be objectionable to some adversary, and more)
* nevertheless, while we live we must resist, every day, in every way we can

I agree with the last two points.  However I believe that resistance is not futile.  Unfortunately, the reason why not is that those same overwhelming economic forces are also leading straight to the inevitable destruction of the global economy and of our modern trans-national techno-society. Which means, unfortunately, that most of us can expect to starve or die in some other nasty and time-honored low tech fashion.  Assuming we aren't first gassed or shelled to death by our own government as it struggles to control bread riots.  

So we should resist to honor the human spirit, to satisfy our innate desire for human dignity, while also being aware that despite the actions of ourselves and of our adversaries, we are all headed straight for that darned ole memory hole.

Corporations and their governments always seem to act as if they truly believe they are immortal.  But they aren't.  I think everyone actually knows this, but is amazing how rare it is to actually factor it into our daily lives.
