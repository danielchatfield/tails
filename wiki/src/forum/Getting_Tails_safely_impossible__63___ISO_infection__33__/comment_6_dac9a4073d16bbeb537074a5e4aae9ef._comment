Something to bear in mind about asking specific posters (even \"anonymous\" ones) about their personal habits is the fact that activists know that investigators often target us for personal attention, and they are usually trained to 

* impersonate a friend of the target, or otherwise misrepresent themselves
* identify and exploit weaknesses of their \"targets\" (a word which is sad to say increasingly apppropriate in its other use).  Among these is the very human weakness of wishing to help a fellow human being.

I think such tactics are despicable, but moral qualms have never stopped a secret policeman yet.  Or have they?  Spooks, speak up, tell us your story (if you have one) of the time you declined to do something \"efective\" because the ver thought turned your stomach.  Aw c'mon, we're all anonymous here, right?  You know you want to.
