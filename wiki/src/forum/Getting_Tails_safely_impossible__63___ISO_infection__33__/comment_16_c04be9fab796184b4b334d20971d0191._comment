You obviously have not been following the privacy-security news or posts at the EFF Deeplinks blog or ACLU Blog of Rights.  If you are Tails user, you probably should, for your own safety.

The Tails documentation suggests that helpful-minded but non-technical Tails users can assist other Tails users in this forum by answering questions, and many of us are trying to do that.  You however, are trying to play moderator here, which is not your role.
