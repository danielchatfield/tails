I have a few questions regarding this..

I've noticed one script named tails-security-check located at usr/local/bin that auto-connects to a feed once internet link is established. 

Additionally, once browser is open it goes immediately to home page: https://check.torproject.org/?lang=en-US&small=1

My concern is that such auto-connections would create a distinguishable browsing pattern.

In my case traffic analysis attack is an issue.

Questions are as follows:

Are there any other scripts that run upon connection other than tails-security-check? If yes what are they and how to permanently delete/disable them? Note: I tried to delete tails-security-check but there is no valid permission.

Is there a way to save browser home page as blank?
