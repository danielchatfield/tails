>downloading a bunch of youtube vids is a waste of TOR's bandwidth. 

While I appreciate the concern, I'm not sure this is that simple.

1.) It would only be a *waste* of bandwidth if the videos weren't necessary. Sometimes downloading certain videos could be truly necessary for some reason and not merely for entertainment.

2.) According to the official Tor documentation, the more people using Tor at any given moment, the more protection it provides to every user.

Thus, there would appear to be a tradeoff at play: More robust anonymity but slower vs. less robust anonymity but faster.

3.) One thing people with fast connections can and probably should do is to limit their transfer rate for any downloads of considerable size.
