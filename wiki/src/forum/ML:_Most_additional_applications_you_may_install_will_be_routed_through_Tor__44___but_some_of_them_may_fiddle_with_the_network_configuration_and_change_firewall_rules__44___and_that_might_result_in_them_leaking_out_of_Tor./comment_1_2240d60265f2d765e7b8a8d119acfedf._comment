>Without using Wireshark or related tools, why not change the value of \"WarnUnsafeSocks\" from 0 to 1 inside /etc/tor/torrc ?

Can I make the change after I have downloaded the Tails ISO using PowerISO for Windows? I can open up the Tails ISO using PowerISO, make the suggested change and save it back as Tails ISO.

I use Microsoft Windows 99% of the time.
