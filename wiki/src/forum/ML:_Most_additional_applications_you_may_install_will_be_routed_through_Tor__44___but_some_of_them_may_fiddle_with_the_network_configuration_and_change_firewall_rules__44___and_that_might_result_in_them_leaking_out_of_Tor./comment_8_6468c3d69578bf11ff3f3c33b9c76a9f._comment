> The reason why the unsafe browser exists is that a lot of people were complaining about the fact that it was impossible to use Tails on public Wifi hotspots where you were required to login or accept some user agreement before you could access the network freely since the Tor browser would not connect to anything without Tor, and you couldn't connect to the Tor network before you logged in.

That makes sense, and is a more direct description of the purpose of the \"unsafe\" browser than something I remember reading in the documentation.  So thanks.
