I'm unable to use my printer because in order to install the drivers, I require lsb to be installed. I get this error upon using the Package Manager:


    The following packages have unresolvable dependencies.
    Make sure that all required repositories are added and
    enabled in the preferences.
    ----
    lsb:
     Depends: lsb-core but it is not going to be installed
     Depends: lsb-graphics but it is not going to be installed
     Depends: lsb-cxx but it is not going to be installed
     Depends: lsb-desktop but it is not going to be installed

The recomended driver within Tails does not work. What repositories should I add in order to make sure lsb has the correct dependencies for Tails?
