Been increasingly getting the above error -- could be something to do with uptime (currently running at over 4 days).  It is not to do with the number of tabs open - the above was a freshly run FF with only the one tab open.

A lot of webpages also displaying as though missing a stylesheet, rendering the page as though it were HTML 1.0.
