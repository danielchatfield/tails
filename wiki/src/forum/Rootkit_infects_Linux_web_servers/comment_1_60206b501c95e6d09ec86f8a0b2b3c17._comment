No mention of the infection vector yet... but a line:

>The rootkit adds the line insmod /lib/modules/2.6.32 5-amd64/kernel/sound/module_init.ko to the /etc/rc.local script, ensuring that the malicious module is executed each time the system boots. 

Makes me think this might be more a case of breathes over-sensationalist \"journalism\" and less big scary \"root-kit\" after all!
