> Does anyone know if/how Tails would be affected if booted on a system infected with the recently discovered \"Rootkit.Linux.Snakso.a\" rootkit?

I'm unsure what you mean. Tails is completely independent of any other OS present on a system it boots on, so Tails will be completely unaffected from any such infection. It's another question if Tails is booted in a VM with an infected host.

That said, this rootkit is apparently 64-bit only, and since Tails is 32-bit only, Tails is immune from infection.

> The malware module was specially designed for the kernel version 2.6.32-5-amd64, which happens to be the latest kernel used in 64-bit Debian Squeezy

Another reason, I suppose, for Tails itself to be immune from infection, since it runs unstable kernels, not those from Debian Squeeze.
