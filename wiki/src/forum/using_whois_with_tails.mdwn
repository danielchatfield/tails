I got this from the terminal in Tails:

"whois XXX.XXX.XXX.X
WARNING: tsocks is known to leak DNS and UDP data.  If you had torsocks we would use that."

...I was just poking around and following my curiosity. Is it safe to use the whois command with tails or should I prefer a webpage based alternative instead?
