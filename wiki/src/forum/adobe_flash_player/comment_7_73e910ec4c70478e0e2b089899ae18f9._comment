I tried the 
amnesia@amnesia:~$ sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree

then from add-on in the browser i can shockware flash as a plugin and i clicked enable

this did not get youtube vids to work and when i re-boot the plugin is lost

Tails must come up with something that works on youtube vids and not just the html5 vids becaue a lot of people do little else than veiw vids all day long and expect multimedia even at the prices of security in the form of shared objects/ flash cookies

seems like lots of things in tails are not persisted and it takes far too long to keep having to setup items before you can use the system
