\"Stupid to host a exit node and your home/university campus/work wifi\"


If creating exit node in workplace and educational institutions is not safe, where the hell people run exit node? Yes, agreed that it is risky to create exit node at home, but what's the problem if we install TOR in every computer and set up exit node? Don't u think that we will get many new nodes this way and no responsibility can be fixed on any person.
