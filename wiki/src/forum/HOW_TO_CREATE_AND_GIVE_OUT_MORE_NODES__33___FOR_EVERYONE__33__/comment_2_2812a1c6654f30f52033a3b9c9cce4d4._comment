In my campus, a firewall called cyberoam has been installed and each and every employee has been given a username and password to use internet. 

Procedure is: who wants to use internet, will have to open web browser. A login page will appear from something like //192.186.1.....//cyberoam....

Now we have to fill in our username and password to browse the websites. What we do is recorded at hte campus server alongwith browser detail and time stamp.

If we have to download something, we must keep the browser window logged on, else no application will work, because browser login runs the internet.

Now i want to run TOR, WHAT SHOULD I DO? It doesn't run as all the proxies and known ports are blocked?

IF I take there my bootable USB, won;t it demand login detail? I don't think that internet will work in the campus.

Cyberoam is the world'sbest firewall and they have even offiially delcared that they have blocked tor, tails, johndo, freegate, proxies etc.

IF YOU GIVE ME A WAY OUT TO BYPASS IT, I CAN RUN THE TOR MAKING RELAY OF EACH COMPUER SITUATED IN COMPUTER LAB. tHERE ARE TOTAL 10000 COMPUTERS (INCLUDING 439 IN HOSTELS where we have full access). If I make relays from 439 computers via TAILS USB OR BOOT CD or using TOR BUNDLE, can we give to the whole world so many relays for their use?

Reply me urgently so that I may issue instructions to all my friends to do the same in their respective colleges and campuses.
