It would be a shame to be forced to add rules on this forum..

So *please stop SHOUTING, [search the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki.cgi?P=), [the web](https://startpage.com/) and [think about](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html) before posting.*

Anyway, what about including a 'Run Tor as relay' option in Tails greeter, in the Tails' [[kiosk edition|todo/kiosk_mode/]], or [[server edition|todo/kiosk_mode/]]?

It's quite easy now to acces to internet connections with a huge bandwith, it could be interesting to think about a way to turn Tails in a easy way to share this.

A few ideas:

1. Tor relay
2. Tor hidden service host
3. Torrents seeder (potentially [[untorified|todo/add_support_for_free_wifi_hotspots/]]?) 
4. Encrypted remote storage, for example [Tahoe-LAFS](https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs)
