I believe the \"stupid\" remark from above writer related to running an exit node *on an open wifi*. Imho it is never good to run anything Tails related over open wifi, it makes you too vulnerable (for example traffic monitoring).

Another point about \"intelligent packet inspection\" and consequent enforced policies made me wonder.

As I understand from 28C3 \"how governments have tried to block tor\", so far all \"smart\" tor traffic filtering has failed? Correct?
