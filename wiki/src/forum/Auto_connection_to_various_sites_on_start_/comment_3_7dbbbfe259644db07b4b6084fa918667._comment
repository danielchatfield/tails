We do have the Tails Documentation page which acts as somewhat of a Tails wiki, but it's true that it is lacking info on a lot of topics that are fruqently asked on this forum, also sorry if my first post seemed a bit aggressive, It's nothing personal, I was just a bit tired of that qustion since it's a question that seems to have been posted here quite frequently lately.
