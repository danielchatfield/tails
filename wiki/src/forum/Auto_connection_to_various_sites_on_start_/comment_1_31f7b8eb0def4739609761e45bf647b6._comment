This is like the 6th time this has been asked on this forum, please use the search button next time.

Anyway, to actually answer your question, Tails connects to varius random websites on start to get accurate time info that is uses to properly synch the computer clock to GMT, this is something that needs to be done for .onion services to work proeprly.

It should be noted that all of the connections go through Tor so it's not like Tails is making connections to random website over clearnet.
