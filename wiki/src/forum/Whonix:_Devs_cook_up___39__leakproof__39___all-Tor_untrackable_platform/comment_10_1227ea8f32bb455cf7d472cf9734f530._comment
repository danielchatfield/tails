Stealing VM Keys from the Hardware Cache

Research into one VM stealing crypto keys from another VM running on the same hardware.

    ABSTRACT: This paper details the construction of an access-driven side-channel attack by which a malicious virtual machine (VM) extracts fine-grained information from a victim VM running on the same physical computer. This attack is the first such attack demonstrated on a symmetric multiprocessing system virtualized using a modern VMM (Xen). Such systems are very common today, ranging from desktops that use virtualization to sandbox application or OS compromises, to clouds that co-locate the workloads of mutually distrustful customers. Constructing such a side-channel requires overcoming challenges including core migration, numerous sources of channel noise, and the difficulty of preempting the victim with sufficient frequency to extract fine-grained information from it. This paper addresses these challenges and demonstrates the attack in a lab setting by extracting an ElGamal decryption key from a victim using the most recent version of the libgcrypt cryptographic library.

**This is why OpenBSD devs on the mailing list relentlessly flame anybody claiming VMs by Xen or virtualbox provide any sort of seperation or supposedly increase security. Another reason is the layering of new bugs on top of the already mess of arch that is x86**
