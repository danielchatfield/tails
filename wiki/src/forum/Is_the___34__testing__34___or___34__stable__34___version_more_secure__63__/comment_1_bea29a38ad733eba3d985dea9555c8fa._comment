>Does the testing version of Tails have more security patches? 

Well, by *definition*, any latest *testing* version will always be *newer* than the latest *stable* version, right?

So, since patches are *continually* released...odds are...(do the math) 

>Is it likely to be more secure?

*If* a testing release doesn't have any critical security bugs that are severe enough to outweigh what is unpatched on the stable version...

But that won't be known until some testing is done...

So, basically, using a testing version for any thing beyond *testing* is taking a risk; making a gamble.
