So the check that is done when Tails starts only tells us when a new \"tested\" version has come out, they don't release a new version as soon as major holes are found (or publically published)?

>So, basically, using a testing version for any thing beyond testing is taking a risk; making a gamble.

... and the \"stable\" version is taking a greater gamble because that one has holes that are well known?
