Alright so I'm wondering if this is possible. I'm using a 4gb flash drive and I was curious If you could set it up so that there would be encryption on the whole usb which would have to have the password entered before the os boots up. So essentially The flash drive would be encrypted and after password entry then tails would run. Sorry if my wording is poor on this. However thank you to anyone who can answer this!
