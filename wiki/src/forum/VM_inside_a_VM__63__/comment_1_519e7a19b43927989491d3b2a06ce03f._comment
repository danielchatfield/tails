*\"On the Mac I have a Debian 6 VM running in VMWare Fusion. I do control this VM
and can do anything with it.\"* -> From a security / privacy / anonymity
point-of-view, you don't control this VM much more than you control OSX and
VMWare. See [[our virtualization warning page|support/virtualization]] for
details.

*\"what should I be concerned about, security-wise, and how do I minimize those
concerns?\"* -> If any of the two hosts systems writes cleartext swap on disk,
the Tails' \"amnesic\" property is lost. For the rest, see the aforementioned
documentation page.

*\"There's got to be a way to secure Tails in this VM onion, right?\"* -> Sorry, I
don't understand your question.
