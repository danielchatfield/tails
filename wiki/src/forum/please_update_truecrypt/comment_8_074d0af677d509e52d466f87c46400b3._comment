>Do any of the respected cryptographers recommend using \"multi-layered crypto\" or any other similar nonsense that you mentioned?

Why do you care? Why is \"multi-layered crypto\" presented as a quotation, when it is not? What is the purpose of this strangely vacuous rhetoric? You are happy with LUKS. Probably in its default configuration. That is wonderful. My heart is filled with joy for you. Now please, go back to sleep. Nothing to see here.
