>Can you stop with the childish narcissism please? You are on a public forum, so you are trying to advocate a point. Do any of the respected cryptographers recommend any of the features that you suggest? If yes, please link to the relevant opinions. If no, then users who value their privacy shouldn't use such features, and your requests about TrueCrypt should be ignored.

Dude, I genuinely don't care about your argument. The OP was simply enquiring if tc would be updated in t-11. A singularly reasonable inquiry in my view. Someone jumped in with the usual \"you don't want to be using x you want to be using y\". You? As far as I can see that's the only advocacy presented here. Utterly unsolicited at that. If you have a sincere interest in the (long and at times distinguished) discussion of the various costs and merits of cascades and the like, then you have google and the whole world at the tips of your fingers. I suspect you don't. You seem far more interested in what others use... or, even more suspiciously, shouldn't be using!

Why do you persist? The only unsolicited rhetoric here has been yours. The only factual error here has been yours. When that exploded you switched to name-calling. So far I appear to have been branded a narcissist, kindergarten, childish (at least twice), etc. Why? Why do you feel compelled to go on attempting to undermine me? To what end? You're really that desperate for **everyone** to stop using truecrypt and **all** migrate to LUKS? Even though there's never been even a sniff of a weakness in truecrypt's cunning open source implementation of those venerable primitives? Why? Why do you care what I use? Why are you trying to subvert someone's perfectly reasonable thread about truecrypt? This is all so weird and unnecessary.

Obviously I'll not be replying to this again. There's clearly no point. I suggest we both leave this thread to the OP and pertinent responses. You don't want anyone to use truecrypt. Yes, I hear you. I refer you to my original comment. Nothing has changed. If you really must persist in this vein, then I suggest you start a new thread, perhaps entitled \"I'd like everyone to stop using truecrypt and switch to luks\"
