Thank god. You do it your way and I'll do it mine. Personally, I couldn't give a fsck how *you* keep *your* data. Xor it against an infinite repetition of your password if you like. Now if only you'd stop trying so desperately to persuade/corral *me* into keeping *my* data *your* way, then we could all get along swimmingly.

Let's not hear any more nonsence, eh?
