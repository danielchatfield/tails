Maybe people who have data hidden in a TrueCrypt container can begin to migrate these data onto a LUKS partition, no?

LUKS (for Linux Unified Key Setup) is now the standard for encrypted filesystems on GNU/Linux operating systems. So you can access your encrypted data from any Linux distro on which cryptsetup is installed. To do that, you can use cryptsetup as root, or pmount or udisks as any unprivileged user. OK, cryptsetup and pmount are commandline tools. Udisks too, but it provides facilities to do it in a graphical way. It is perfectly integrated with the most common desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, LXDE), is open source (under GPL), and actively maintained and developped.

NOTE: and even, in some emergency cases, and if your LUKS partition contains a FAT32 filesystem, you can access your precious/hidden data from any version of Windoz with FreeOTFE: <http://www.freeotfe.org>.
