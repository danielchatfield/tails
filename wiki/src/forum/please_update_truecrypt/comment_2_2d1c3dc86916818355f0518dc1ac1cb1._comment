Personally, I'll *never* be migrating to LUKS.

The truecrypt design and ethos is extremely sophisticated yet still \"transparent\". Its absolutely inspired design layers and compounds many diverse and extremely well tested primitives to deliver a system with an outstanding margin.

LUKS on the other hand forces you to put all your eggs in a single cryptographic basket, which it implements in an obsolete manner. Archaic, naiive and obsolete by comparisson and perhaps by design.

I often wonder why these GNU tools always insist on depending on a single ancient NSA endorsed primitive... the wickedly inadequate/unfit MD5/SHA digest family is a particularly fine example. What sort of chretin would design a *new* system around something as rotten as MD5? Still, *wonder* is all any of us can do. Wonder and **not touch with a bargepole**.

If tails makes it any more difficult to use truecrypt, I'll be more likely to migrate to Parted Magic!
