As the \"OP\", this is what I think about all the truecrypt vs LUKS things:

I mostly do things on my own computer, on an extremely safe Windows 7 (no logs, no usage tracking ever; yes it is possible, not easy though) + using Truecrypt for some data (not the operating system). Sometimes I use Tails when I need more security with an internet access or when I just need Linux. So Truecrypt is a nice & easy program to use across different OSs.

I recently found this: https://www.privacy-cd.org

Ubuntu Privacy Remix. It's an operating system providing a secure workspace. No internet access, no hard disk access etc. It also has Truecrypt so a very nice solution. I can use my Truecrypt container between Windows, Tails, and UPR easily. This is why I keep using it.

If you look at the website, you will find the doubleboot iso consist of UPR + \"Tails\".

I think carrying a DVD or USB stick with both of them is great. But note that, the iso doesn't have the latest Tails version and also you may need to update some files in the \"isotails\" folder manually (you can use WinMerge to compare). I did it and works great. Just plug-in the USB and choose between these operating systems. Tails for internet access, UPR for the rest.
