I recently found this: https://www.privacy-cd.org

Ubuntu Privacy Remix. It's an operating system providing a secure workspace. No internet access, no hard disk access etc. It also has Truecrypt so a very nice solution. I can use my Truecrypt container between Windows, Tails, and UPR easily. This is why I keep using it.

If you look at the website, you will find the doubleboot iso consist of UPR + \"Tails\".

I think carrying a DVD or USB stick with both of them is great. But note that, the iso doesn't have the latest Tails version and also you may need to update some files in the \"isotails\" folder manually (you can use WinMerge to compare). I did it and works great. Just plug-in the USB and choose between these operating systems. Tails for internet access, UPR for the rest.

What's the best way to update to the latest edition of tails, or/and how do you dual-boot them? When attempting it would just go to tails. I take it there's a command prompt? Do you have to reset tails to access UPR (resetting), what commands should one use?
