> If you have a sincere interest in the (long and at times distinguished) discussion of the various costs and merits of cascades and the like, then you have google and the whole world at the tips of your fingers.

Internet discussion of children like you, perhaps. I have an education in cryptography, and have never heard of such discussion in research circles. I asked you to refer to established research, and you failed. I suspect there isn't one.

> I suspect you don't.

I suspect that you don't have any actual education on the subject.

> You seem far more interested in what others use... or, even more suspiciously, shouldn't be using! Why do you persist? The only unsolicited rhetoric here has been yours.

I presented short questions and arguments. Your suspicions are irrelevant. You presented long useless rhetoric in the style of high school discussion club.
