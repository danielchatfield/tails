You are using a PC running Windows, correct?

Sounds good

How confusing. It seems there is a discontinued certificate manager and crypto GUI for KDE (another desktop which can be used with Debian instead of Gnome) called Kleopatra, and a GUI related to gpg4win which is also called Kleopatra.  I guess you mean the second but have no idea how it works.

That might indicate that you did not in fact import the key into your gpg keyring.

I second the advice to use the command line.  If you can fire up a shell you can just (carefully!) paste the commands given in the Tails documenation into your shell and hit return/enter.

Be very careful to keep your GPG keyring encrypted (or even on a seperate single use storage device you keep on your person) when you are not using it.  Unfortunately the GPG default is to keep the keyring in a default location.  The secure keys in your own keypairs are hashed but this still leaves you open to attack by anyone who can access your hard drive (such as a border crossing guard who threatens to arrest you if you do not boot up your computer so he/she can search/image the hard drive and/or search/image the RAM).
