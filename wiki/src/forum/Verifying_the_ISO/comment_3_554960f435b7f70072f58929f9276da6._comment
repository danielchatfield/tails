>I imported the signing key and then put the sig into the input file and I put the iso download into the signed data. Is this correct?

Did you try this the other way around? I wouldn't be surprised if \"signed data\" turned out to be a misleading grammatical error intended to convey \"signature data\" or something similar!

I \"third\" the command line motion all the same. Quicker and easier than firing up a GUI and fiddling with an embarrassment of fields, settings and buttons!

Don't worry too much about the closing paragraph of comment 2! It's way off topic. You needn't even posses any private keys! ...but if you did, as I do, you might still consider it well meaning but pointless nonsense
