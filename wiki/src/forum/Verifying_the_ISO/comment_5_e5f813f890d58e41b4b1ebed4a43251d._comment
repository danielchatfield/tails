>Don't worry too much about the closing paragraph of comment 2! It's way off topic. You needn't even posses any private keys! ...but if you did, as I do, you might still consider it well meaning but pointless nonsense

Not *complete* nonsense. If you *do* have private keys you *should* keep them encrypted (as they are by default). Certainly off topic though.... and the complaints about \"default location\" reek of mindless paranoia. \"Security by obscurity\" anyone?

Apart from that. Very good. Carry on.
