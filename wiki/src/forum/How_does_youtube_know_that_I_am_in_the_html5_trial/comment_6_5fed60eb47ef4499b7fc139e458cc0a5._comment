Via Tor, nothing is 100% safe, unless you verify checksums and/or gnupg signed files, even then you'd want to use SSL to access the checksums and/or signed files and try with several different exit nodes at different times of day to verify the download is correct.

With YouTube, you don't have that luxury. But, if you must download with blind trust through Tor, try:

# Youtube-dl

# http://bitbucket.org/rg3/youtube-dl/wiki/Home

or

# Clive

#http://clive.sourceforge.net/

Do not install any extra browser plugins, especially not Flash. And do not trust/load html5 videos in your browser.

use the proxy option available in either with the correct proxy port #.
