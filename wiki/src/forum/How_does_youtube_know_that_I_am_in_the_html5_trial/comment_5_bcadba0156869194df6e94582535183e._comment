What is safe? If you want to download videos from youtube you could install unplug. It is basically a group of rules for extracting videos from websites.

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unplug/#beta-channel
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/unplug/versions/

All versions should be safe ip-wise to use with tails, especially the 2.051beta which is being developed with tor in mind, but since it is a browser add-on it could screw your user-agent. I do not know if the installed tor-button can protect you in this specific case.
