I think that \"file open error\" means that the path to the file you want to check is incorrect.

You first have to browse to the folder where the .ISO and .PGP files are.

For example

`cd /home/YOU/Downloads`

Then: gpg --verify tails-i386-0.1**8**.iso.pgp tails-i386-0.1**8**.iso (Note the 0.1**8** instead of 0.16)

Do you think something could be improved in the [[documentation page|doc/get/verify_the_iso_image_using_the_command_line/]] ?

Cheers, tom
