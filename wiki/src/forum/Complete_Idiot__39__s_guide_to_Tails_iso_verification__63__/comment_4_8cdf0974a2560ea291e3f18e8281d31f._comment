Thanks! So after downloading the three files to the Debian desktop, I just open the terminal, and type these two things into it, one after the other?

gpg --import tails-signing.key

gpg --verify tails-i386-0.16.iso.pgp tails-i386-0.16.iso

And that will do it? Just like that, no further modifications?
