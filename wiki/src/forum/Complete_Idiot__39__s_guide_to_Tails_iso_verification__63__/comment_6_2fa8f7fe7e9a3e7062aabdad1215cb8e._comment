So you are using Debian as your OS.

Please surf to this page: https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#verify

Scroll down to the line which says: Otherwise, read our instructions to check the ISO image integrity

Click on the green-colored link which says: Using Linux with Gnome: Ubuntu, Debian, Tails, etc.

Some text will be displayed.

Follow the instructions.

That's all.
