>I can move the cursor with the laptop touchpad. But it seem that touchpad tap function is not working when I move the cursor over the 'Application' or any of the pulldown menu.

System > Preferences > Mouse >Touchpad 

Check \"Enable mouse clicks with touchpad\"

>2. How to I control the desktop pulldown menu with the keyboard?

Tab, arrow keys and shift.

Are the touchpad *buttons* working?
