Wired magazine is reporting that as part of the so-called "six strikes" anti-piracy program, Comcast is now messing with users computers.  From:

     http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/02/comcast-browser-hijack/

> Comcast is to begin hijacking browsers of its internet subscribers who are detected of repeatedly infringing on public file-sharing networks 

Today browser hijacking, tommorrow rootkits (recall Sony?) and keyloggers.

I myself am not even using file-sharing, but this is obviously the thin end of the wedge, and we must expect that companies like Comcast-NBC-Universal will soon be hijacking browsers for other alleged "infractions".

Does anyone know how the Comcast hijacking works?  Does disabling Javascript prevent it from working?
