> Is there anyway to tailor it , loosen the grip up?

Sure. To open the firewall for incomming TCP connections on some ports, run something like:

    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn -m multiport --dports ${PORTS} -j ACCEPT

where `${PORTS}` is a comma-separated list. For a Tor relay `${PORTS}` should contain `ORPort` (usually `443` or `9001`) and possibly `DirPort` (usually `9030`).

However, I still wonder why you want to run a relay in Tails when there's much better solutions like Tor-ramdisk. Also, remember that you'll lose your onion key (your relays cryptographic keys, which is the same as its identity) after reboot unless you make `/var/lib/tor` [[persistent|doc/first_steps/persistence]] (by specifying it as a [[custom directory|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#index10h2]]).

> Doesnt it effect I2P as well?

Sure, but I2P can run splendidly behind a firewall even without port-forwarding just like a Tor **client**, but unlike a Tor **relay**.
