> Just cant seem to get the TOR Relay to work at all.. Any ideas?

Tails drops all incoming connections, so this is not surprising. There are better options for running Tor relays than Tails, e.g. [Tor-ramdisk](http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdisk). For the record I have a vague memory of a paper describing an attack against Tor clients that also run as Tor relays, so don't do that.

> Is IPtables used to take care of all the traffic routing? Ive noticed few app's dl'd , installed. no proxy config has been needed and yet piggy backs onto tor. 

This was the case in Tails version prior to 0.10, where all traffic was sent through Tor using iptables. We [[decided to drop that behaviour|todo/the_end_of_transparent_proxying__63__]], so what you describe should not be the case any longer if you have updated Tails recently (which is *highly* recommended).

> How does that work?

Please see our [firewall config from Tails 0.9](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/etc/firewall.conf;h=27b3d47fb2624ebd624ccaa4286d0424a149b31b;hb=977e76bed29269eea7e8a1c8c5c6b430e4c24304) (line 65 is what's interesting, and note that Tor's `TransPort` is configured to port 9040 in `/etc/tor/torrc`).
