No need to disable NoScript globally, you only need to whitelist the video:

1. go to youtube
2. go to the video page you want
3. if this video is available as HTML5, instead of the \"you need flashplayer bla bla\" message, you get a nice HTML5 player with a crossed S letter (the symbol of NoScript) at the top left of the video area.
4. Right click on the video area, go to NoScript -> Blocked objects, allow the blocked object.
5. the playback should start.
