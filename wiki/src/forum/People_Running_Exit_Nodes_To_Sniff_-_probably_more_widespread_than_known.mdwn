>"For the past seven hours my computer has been running as a Tor exit node and sniffing whatever is sent out or received in on ports of interest (80, 110, 143). All of the data recorded ended up being on port 80. It seems people use Tor for little more than web browsing. What's just awful though is that they don't seem to be browsing anything that's the least bit sensitive.
