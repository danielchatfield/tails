>Rule of thumbs: always try without leaving the Unsafe Browser opened first.

Suppose I need to have a small pop-up window opened to keep the access alive, which means the \"Unsafe Browser\" is opened.

Next, I launch Iceweasel. I am able to tell the two open browsers apart.

I start using Iceweasel to surf the internet, use Pidgin for chat, I2P for mail, etc....

Questions:

1. Are the communication packets on Iceweasel, Pidgin, I2P, WhisperBack, etc torrified?

2. Are the communication packets on Iceweasel, Pidgin, I2P, WhisperBack, etc. leaked to/captured by the \"Unsafe Browser\"?

Thanks in advance for your reply.
