>Before I ask my question, I would like to state that I have gone through the relevant posts on this forum and the links to two articles: https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/unsafe_browser/index.en.html and https://tails.boum.org/misc/unsafe_browser_warning/

**Scenario**

Suppose I am in an internet cafe whose customers need to log in to its captive portal first before they can have internet access.

I do the following:

1. I insert the Live USB into the PC's USB slot and boot the computer from the USB flash/thumb drive.

2. To log in to the captive portal, I launch the \"Unsafe Browser\".

3. I input the login details.

4. I ensure that I have internet access.

5. I exit the \"Unsafe Browser\".

6. I launch Iceweasel to start my so-called anonymous web browsing.

Question: When the \"Unsafe Browser\" exits, won't the internet connection be lost as well? I mean, won't the computer lose its internet connection?
