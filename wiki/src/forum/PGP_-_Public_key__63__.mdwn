Hi there

New to using PGP and i'm having a little trouble- I've followed the instructions:

System -> Preferences -> Passwords and Encryption Keys
File -> New
-> "PGP Key"

and successfully generated a new key. Having exported the key to the home folder and opened as a text file, I've obtained:

-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)

followed by the rest of the block.

There doesn't appear to be a public key block. Am I supposed to use this private key block as my public key?
