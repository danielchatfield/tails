can we still use button New Identity? I clicked it several times in last 15 minutes and I have all the time the same IP. beside it, torstatus.blutmagie.de is freezing 10 seconds before it show result. 

the same IP is problem because when I use several different email accounts at the same provider, admin can see very easy that all these accounts belong to the same person. it is the same when we visit deep web forums, etc. so, i believe that users should be able to change IP address manually. beside it, we can be connected with bad/spying node and we can not change it...
