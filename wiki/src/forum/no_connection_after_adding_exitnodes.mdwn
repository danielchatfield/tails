Hi, today I upgraded USB and when I try to add ExcludeNodes in torrc file, firefox loose connection. even it is written tor connected in Vidalia control panel.

I do as I did before, gedit /etc/tor/torrc and then I add ExcludeNodes 80.237.226.74................ 

but this time it is not functional.
