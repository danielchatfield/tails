I will be happy to get 0.10 :):):) 

is it possible to include wuala for linux? wuala is online secure storage (but I am not sure if installation of software demand Java or just Javascript). CryptoMX and OpenStego or some other stenography softwares would be good too. I would like that tails has more than pgp, there are other types of encryptions (to encypt voice, etc) and hiding encrypted text in pictures. 

CryptoMX is a collection of encryption, hashing, conversion, and steganography tools. It will work on any OS with a JavaScript capable browser. OpenStego is for including encrypted files into pictures.

and in iceweasel options it would be good to switch off saving of passwords. and add-on called cipherbox can give us possibility to make online encryption (secret message inside of your blog, for example, only person with cipherbox and password can see message and decrypt it). 

I think tails can improve itself with more encryption tools, so, users have bigger choice.
