 When i booting Tails from USB and want to start using Tor I always get those messages:         

The server at check.torproject.org is 
taking too long to respond.
        

        
        

 1) The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
    moments.
  2) If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
    connection.
  3) If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
    that Iceweasel is permitted to access the Web.
