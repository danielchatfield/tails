I've been having ongoing issues with TAILS 10.0. The problem is that Tor searches for connections and either fails to authenticate a circuit or fails to find a circuit. It seems like the only way to restart it (which so far is the only method I've found to fix the issue) is to restart TAILS. 

The messages are always regarding failed authentication certificates, asking me to contact someone, or failed connections because it can't find a circuit, or that the clock is not in sync. Anyways, I'm on a wireless router, but that doesn't seem to be the issue because it's actually using the internet.

Anyone have any idea how I can resolve this issue so Tor isn't so scetchy?
