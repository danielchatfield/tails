I spent an hour getting it all set-up because I thought that is part of what persistance was about...     all gone   =(
I see it mentioned that synaptic programs all need to be \"reloaded\", does this mean they are hiding somewhere in my persistant folder?  I find nothing there...
After I download and use a synaptic, can I store the product of that session and find THAT after downloading the appropriate program again?  (and needing to reset preferences    =(
OK, you might say that I need a different distro of linux at this point, but I like TAILS, otherwise    =)
thanks for any comments about this!
I really do appreciate that it is a LOT of work to create this, and I'm very glad it exists!
