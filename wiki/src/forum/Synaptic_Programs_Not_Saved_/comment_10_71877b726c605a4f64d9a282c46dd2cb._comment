and there it is!
This is a really good distro, I like the look/feel/action
AND
this is the best, most effective, successful help section I have ever asked a question in    =)

I'm surprised that the downloaded programs are in the main scetion instead of the persistent section... AND I LIKE IT THAT WAY ...
and I might just have to expand the main section if I get LOTS of programs downloaded, but I think it is probably already big enough at the default size...
You are really good at all this   =)
