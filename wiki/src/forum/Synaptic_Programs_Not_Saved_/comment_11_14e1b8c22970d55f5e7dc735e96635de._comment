for those who read this later...
I had to tails usb sticks, I used gparted on one of them to resize the main partition on the other so there would be more room on that main partition for extra programs.

It did not work the way I had hoped, next time I attempted to boot the modified usb it told me \"missing OS\"...    besides, there really IS enough room there in the original configuration  =)

Once again, great program, great execution in creating it, and awesome support help!
=)
