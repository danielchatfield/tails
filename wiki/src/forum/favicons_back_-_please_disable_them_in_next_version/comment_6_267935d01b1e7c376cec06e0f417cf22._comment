> Not quite the same as infection from a favicon, but perhaps close enough to illustrate the potential danger

This example merely illustrates that there may be untrusted, dangerous content loaded by a web browser, and that web sites can be easily hacked when admin'ed without security in mind. That's how things are, and Tails won't change it. The task of a web browser is to deal with that state of things, and disabling favicons won't help much.

Let's go back to the topic, if anyone has relevant information to add, or close it, else.
