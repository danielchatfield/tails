What you describe has happened many times to me as well.

Usually, the synchorinazation seems to finish within several minutes.

I don't know why the browser opens before the sync is complete and before the Vidalia icon has turned green.

Once the Vidalia icon has turned green, however, you shouldn't have a problem with reloading the check.torproject.org page or going to any other URL you wish.

There were a few times, when the sync just hung indefinitely, and I had to exit Vidalia and then restart it from *Appplications -> Internet -> Vidalia*

If all else fails, you may have to shutdown and restart TAILS, as I had to do once or twice. But thankfully, that should be quite rare.
