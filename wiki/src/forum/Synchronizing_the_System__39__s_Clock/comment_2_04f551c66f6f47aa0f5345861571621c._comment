When I boot up my TAILS USB, I have my router turned off while I make changes to the /etc/tor/torrc file and some other system files while in root account.

Before I exit root, I issue a date -u MMDDhhmm command to set the UTC time value which you see in the upper right-hand main menu bar to the left of the shutdown icon.

This helps (usually) to speed up synchronization of the system clock and Vidalia and the Iceweasel browser launch soon afterward verifying that Tor is properly established.

If things seem to get stuck, I will enter the root acount, and stop and restart Tor with the following two commands in sequence:

    /etc/init.d/tor stop
    /etc/init.d/tor start|restart

That is what I had to do today to get unstuck even though the date command properly set the UTC time (I use an atomic watch which is sync'd to figure out when to hit ENTER for the date command).
