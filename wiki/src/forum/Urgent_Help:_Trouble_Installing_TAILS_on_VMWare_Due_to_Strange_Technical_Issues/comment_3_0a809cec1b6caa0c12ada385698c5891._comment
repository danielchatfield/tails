- Use VirtualBox instead of VMWare. VMWare is closed source proprietary software, and hence not supported as third parties cannot review and verify VMWare actually is secure and free from backdoors.

- And don't use Windows as a host OS, for same reasons. Best is to not run Tails in a virtual machine at all. Boot your computer from the DVD instead.
