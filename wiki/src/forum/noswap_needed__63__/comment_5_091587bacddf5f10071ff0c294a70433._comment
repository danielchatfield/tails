>Tails is unconditionally connecting to its servers on each boot

Not quite true. Each Tails session checks its status with the Tails server once, the moment it is first connected to the 'net by the user. This is done anonymously, by a secure connection relayed across the Tor network. Thus the session is able to determine whether it is (potentially dangerously) outdated and, if so, warn the user and recommend immediate disconnection. This has been explained to you many times. It is an *important* security *feature* wouldn't you agree? Do you wish to suggest a better way to accomplish this essential task?

>the project is not dead.

No. Clearly most people can understand this then.

>Tails could add boot menu settings persistence (for example) in a small hard drive portion, and you would probably say it's fine and justified.

What are you talking about?
