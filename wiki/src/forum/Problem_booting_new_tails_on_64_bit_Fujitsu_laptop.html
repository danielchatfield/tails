<p>Hi</p>

<p>The new version of Tails doesn't want to boot for me. 0.11 worked just fine. After successfuly negotiating the boot menu it whirrs away for a little while then hangs at a text mode screen with the message:</p>
<p><code>(process:248): GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (0)</code></p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
