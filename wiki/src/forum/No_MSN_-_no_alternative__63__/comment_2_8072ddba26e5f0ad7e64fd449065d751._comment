I have some question as above. 

MSN (Now Windows Live) is very commonly used. I believe the reason it is not an option in pidgin is that it requires SSL setup??


On this page: http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Protocol%20Specific%20Questions#WhyisntMSNinthelistofprotocols

\"Why can't I log into MSN?

You probably did not compile Pidgin with SSL support, or the SSL plugin failed to load. The MSN protocol requires the use of SSL, which Pidgin provides by either GnuTLS or the combination of NSS and NSPR from the Mozilla project. See these notes (http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/FAQssl)  to get SSL up and running.

Why isn't MSN in the list of protocols?

The MSN plugin won't load, but I have Mozilla NSS or GNUTLS or both!

See these notes (http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/FAQssl) on getting SSL up and running. \"

I'm not really sure what this all means or implies, but is setting it up to enable MSN possible?

Regards,

Adam
