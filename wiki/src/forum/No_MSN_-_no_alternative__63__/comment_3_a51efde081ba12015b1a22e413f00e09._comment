This has nothing to do with SSL.

Security holes are discovered in the Pidgin MSN plugin on a quite regular basis.
It looks like this particular piece of software does not meet the security level we are trying
to provide with T(A)ILS.

We, T(A)ILS developpers, cannot afford releasing new images every time a security issue is discovered in this plugin.
That is why it has been disabled.
