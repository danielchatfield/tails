op here

did not disable image loading ... just booting up tails without changing anything ... I could
not see where in iceweasel to check for a favicon setting (couldn't find this in plain old
firefox either)

I realize now the dashed line box is the same one that appears on the left of a blank tab opened
up in FF so I realize now that's where it comes from ... I guess it's fine then as I can see
the padlock and the cert down below, just really surprised me not to see the padlock right
away on left of addy bar.
