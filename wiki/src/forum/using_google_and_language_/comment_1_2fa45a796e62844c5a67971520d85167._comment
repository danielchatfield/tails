In soon to be published Tails 0.10, the default search engine will be Scroogle in any language.
Hope it will suit your needs.

Google Docs will work fine in Tails 0.10.

\"Some sort\" greatly depends on your threat model. Unless you don't
specially trust Internet service providers, be them cloudy or not,
encrypting client-side seems safer. So it may not depend that much on
the service provider.

Using service providers that are more friendly to Tor users would
probably help. If it's not an option, get Google to stop causing such
problems: there's nothing we can do about it in Tails.
