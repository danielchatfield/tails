Thanks for the info. It seems I can now login to google easy. However, google docs has limited functionality for me. (using tails 0.9 still). I am able to access the google docs interface, but I am not able to upload files or use any features of the text editor when you create a new document, spreadsheet, etc. I thought using google docs moblie could fix this. Neverless, it did not. 

If you don't have a way to get the text editor working, that's fine I'll upgrade to tails 0.10 eventually.
