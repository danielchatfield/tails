I'm totally new to tails and i've no experience or so with linux, the only thing i managed to get it working was to burning tails to a dvd, afterwards i inserted the dvd and rebooted my iMac. Tails was booting up itself, however i want to go back to my own mac os x. 
I believe that i need to eject the dvd, so i can run my own mac os x, however i can't eject it at all!
I've tried to hold down the option key (failed), also tried to hold down the mouse button while the imac is starting (failed aswell). 

Isn't there a simple option to boot my own choice rather than ejecting the dvd? Which i can't eject anyways.

Please help, remember that i've no experience with coding etc

Thanks in advance guys
