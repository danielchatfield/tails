Before you run off to buy BitCoins, how much do you plan to donate?

A *minimum* amount equivalent to **one hundred Euros** per donation per time would be most welcome.

As you are probably well aware, the Eurozone crisis is still ravaging the livelihoods of many poor Europeans and youth unemployment rate is very high (averaging 30%) in some countries hit hard by the crisis.

In the US, about one hundred thousand jobs might be lost through the US Sequester as a result of the inability of the ruling Democrats to compromise with the opposition Republicans on the budget.
