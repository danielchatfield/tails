Hello, 0.14 is great, thanks all! 

Some questions:

How do I best reach the World Wide Web, step-by-step, through I2P with the Iceweasel browser? 

Should the Tor Button be disabled/uninstalled prior? 

I note that Foxy Proxy in the browser Extensions does have available some preConfigured settings for I2P so, what settings to choose?  

As  Tails is currecntly configured, what IP address will show up in the 12P router directory (NetDB)when started in Tails 0.14 using the default settings? 

Would it be a good idea to add a Iceweasel profile for I2P in Tails? 

Last question, Is there a way to enable spell-checking in and proofing in Open Office? Thank you.
