ok, I'm new to this "boot from USB" kind of operating system and again memory usage in itself. I know that using a Solid State Drive (SSD) only works for the about the first hundred times a cell is written over, eventually the memory corrodes and beings to corrupt and fail. Does using my RAM memory to Dual-Boot cause any kind of corruption if I boot Tails repeatedly?
