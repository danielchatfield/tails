\"Tor blacklisted speech on Tails forums - shame, shame, shame!\"

\"Blacklisted\"? Is that intended to be a contentious, sinister sounding or otherwise manipulative way of saying \"unwelcome\"? All off-topic rantings and ravings are unwelcome here and rightly so. As I'm certain you're aware. The \"shame, shame, shame!\" is on you.
