No. **You are wrong**.

If you'd like to talk about Tor, that's perfectly reasonable. I think there's even somewhere maintained **specifically** for Tor Talk. If only I could remember what it's called, I'd post you [a link](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk).

**[tor-talk - all discussion about theory, design and development of Onion Routing](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk)**
