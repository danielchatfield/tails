\"Anyone interested in a forum for Tor, please see\"

Yes. Let us all visit bug ticket pages separate from the discussion and watch them go nowhere!

Go read Tor's ticket page for a forum, they appear to have no straight forward plan, even after several years of project development. Wave us again to other pages so the subject is ignored and ticket pages left to age or closed.

Tor is a critical, central part of Tails. People should be allowed to discuss Tor here as it applies to Tails! The majority are not going to follow obscure bug tickets and mailing lists, they want simple forums, and this one is decent enough so far, at least it is better than what the Tor developers have given us, so thank you for these forums, Tails developers.

Another issue I have is the shuffling off of the discussion regarding an old version of OpenSSL and NetworkManager included in 0.15. Tails even warns you about OpenSSL when you launch it, while TBB strives to keep OpenSSL current, for good reasons - and has no warning messages about OpenSSL because they keep it up to date.
