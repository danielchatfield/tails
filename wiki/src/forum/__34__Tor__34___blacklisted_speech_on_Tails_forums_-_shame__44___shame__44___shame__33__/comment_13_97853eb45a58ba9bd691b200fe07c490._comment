>@ the user who has \"had enough\" with threads he doesn't like:

Which of us is it you consider to have \"had enough\"? At whom is your (somewhat ironic) little talking to addressed? I say ironic because I don't think your post is any more helpful than any of the others! In fact it seems counterproductive: The solution isn't that we all ignore O/T threads because you dislike Tor-Talk. The solution is that you find somewhere appropriate that you do like.
