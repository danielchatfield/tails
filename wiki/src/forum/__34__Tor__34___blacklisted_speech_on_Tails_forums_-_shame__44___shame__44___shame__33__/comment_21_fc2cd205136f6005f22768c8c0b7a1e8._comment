I don't think this discussion is going anywhere useful for Tails users.

Please:

* If you want to discuss Tor, see existing Tor communication channels.
* If you want a Tor forum, see the tickets linked above and help... or wait.
* If you want to discuss Tails, welcome here.
* If you want a better Tails forum, see [[todo/improve_the_forum]] and help... or wait.
* If you want to discuss anything else, either find a better place to do so, and create it if needed.

I can understand time passes and communication channels don't get better as fast as you would like, but in case it's not obvious: the main consequences of discussing at length why the current tools are suboptimal (with the same bunch of well-known and already agreed reasons), is:

1. demotivating the people who are working to make these tools better;
2. wasting their time, which further postpones the tools improvements we would all like...

Please take all this into account if you want to help.
