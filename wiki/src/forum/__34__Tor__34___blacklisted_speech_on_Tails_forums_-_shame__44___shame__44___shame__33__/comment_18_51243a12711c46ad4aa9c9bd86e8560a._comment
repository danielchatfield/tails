I think you should ignore threads which you think are O/T.  Let the moderator moderate.

Several posters have said that they have had no luck in finding such a thing.  Including the moderator!  But there is at least one thread in this forum discussing the possibility of urging groups like EFF, Chaos Computer Club, to possibly collaborate to create a moderated privacy forum which allows anonymous posting without registration.

@ poster suggesting sockpuppetry:

I sympathize with some things you said, but I don't think such accusations are helpful.  Even if a developer occasionaly posts as \"Anonymous\" instead of \"Tails\", that could be do to human error, not to mal intent.
