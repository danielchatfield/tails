>>The solution isn't that we all ignore O/T threads because you dislike Tor-Talk.

>I think you should ignore threads which you think are O/T. Let the moderator moderate.

Are you an amateur hypocrite or a seasoned connoisseur of hypocrisy?.. because... if that was a fluke... then WOW! Awesome job. Real exhibition quality stuff.

>>The solution is that you find somewhere appropriate that you do like.

Several posters have said that they have had no luck in finding such a thing.

Diddums.

Perhaps they should put some more effort in. Whatever: NOT TAILS SPECIFIC

>Including the moderator!



>But there is at least one thread in this forum discussing the possibility of urging groups like EFF, Chaos Computer Club, to possibly collaborate to create a moderated privacy forum which allows anonymous posting without registration.

>@ poster suggesting sockpuppetry:

>I sympathize with some things you said, but I don't think such accusations are helpful. Even if a developer occasionaly posts as \"Anonymous\" instead of \"Tails\", that could be do to human error, not to mal intent.

>OP is a loser who needs to grow up. someone from TAILS should just delete stupid threads like these that clog up the forums.

Quite... but then the little fuckwit just squawks even louder!..

*OMG! It's a conspiracy! [Tails is an NSA/MI6?MOSSAD/Whatever conspiracy](https://tails.boum.org/forum/File_Found:___34__do__95__not__95__ever__95__run__95__me__34___Why_is_it_in_Tails__63__/#comment-d25ffacd548b692d7cf41604e89a57d5)! I wewwy wewwy clwely discovered a backdoor in Tails!!! OMG! OMG! ..but when I reported it they just deleted my post from the forum! OMG! OMG! OMG!*

I suppose we just have to put up with the braindead little shit(s) and presume all this crap is actually well-meaning!.. at least until someone comes up with [a better solution](https://tails.boum.org/todo/improve_the_forum/) ;)
