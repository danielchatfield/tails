> So you happen to have an obsession with Tor. Whatever. Take it to the Tor community or see a psychiatrist.

Insulting people like this doesn't help to grow the Tails user base, and I for one find this offensive.  Please remember that the developers ask people to use this forum to ask questions and (if you know the answer) to try to help with explanations.

The problem as I see it is that the Tor Project team has chosen not to provide either

* anonymous bug reports like whisperback
* a Tor help forum with anonymous posting similar to this forum

The Tor-talk mailing list is not really for seeking help but for developer-level discussions, and it is anything but anonymous (since an email-mailing list).
