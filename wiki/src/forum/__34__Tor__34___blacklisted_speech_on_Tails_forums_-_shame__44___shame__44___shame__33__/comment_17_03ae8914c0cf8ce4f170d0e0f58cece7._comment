>Tor is a critical, central part of Tails. People should be allowed to discuss Tor here as it applies to Tails!

>Sorry, we don't have the resources to host and manage such a forum.

LOL it has nothing to do with resources at all, not in the replies i've seen attacking people discussing Tor, or telling them to take it to tor-talk.

What's really shameful is, on tor-talk, when someone was discussing tor in tails, they were told to go to the tails forum, followed by some tails guy posting to tor-talk with some type of testing request.

so where should we post if we want to talk about specifics of tails, which includes tor which is central to tails? good question, no good answers.

clearly unless you're kissing ass by posting 'prayer to tails' posts and other such 'tribute', you aren't wanted.

i believe there's a number of sock puppets here posting under anonymous when they should man up and post as tails every time.

welcome to the sock puppet gallery here at boum.org, love it or leave it!
