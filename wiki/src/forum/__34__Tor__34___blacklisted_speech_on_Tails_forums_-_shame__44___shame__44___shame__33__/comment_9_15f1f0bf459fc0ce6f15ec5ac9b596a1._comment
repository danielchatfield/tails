@ the OP:

> Please be more tolerant of posts containing questions and comments about Tor, so long as they are Tails related. Thrusting our heads in the sand and blacklisting Tor discussion here as they relate to Tails is wrong.

I share your frustration, but I think \"Tails\" is in a difficult situation here and we need to try to tolerate moderation decisions we don't like, just as (I think) the moderator here has so far been somewhat tolerant of some discussions (while shutting down others).  I think the solution is to ask the Tails developers to try to urge the Tor project to make anonymous discussion with the Tor community feasible, so that people with a question about Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) will not feel that they have no alternative but to try to ask their question here.
