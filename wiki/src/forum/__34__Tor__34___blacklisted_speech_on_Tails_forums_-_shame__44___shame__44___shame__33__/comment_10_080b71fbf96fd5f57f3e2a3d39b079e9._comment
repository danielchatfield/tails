@ the user who has \"had enough\" with threads he doesn't like:

You know that we all know you can just move on to another thread, right?  Please leave moderation to the moderator.  I think your role here as a non-moderator is to answer questions if you know the answer, or otherwise to read and learn from those who know the answer and are willing to help others by answering questions.

If you are unwilling to just ignore threads here which are not what you consider to be appropriate, why not help address the underlying issue by helping to lobby the Tor Project to provide their own discussion forum?

Again, the Tor-talk mailing list is inappropriate for the kinds of discussions which would benefit the actual user base of Tor, rather than the developers.  If you skim the archives of the Tor-talk mailing list, it is quickly evident that the discussions consist of developer-level technical issues.  But in any case the really critical drawback is that a mailing-list is about as non-anonymous a method of communication as anything I can imagine.

@ everyone:

Let's all try to keep our tempers.  Remember that sowing discord is a method often employed by the enemies of communities like ours who seek to disrupt those who seek freedom of expression and anonymity on-line.
