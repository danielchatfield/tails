\"resulted in a text-mode \"boot:\" \"

The same here with 0.14 RC2 and a little older Universal USB Installer(1.9.0.9)on Windows 7.Cannot get a newer Universal USB Installer,maybe can get it very later.
Press Return don't change this. When typing in / i get:
'Invalid or corrupt kernel image'.
Typing in 'isolinux.bin' Error says:
\"ISOLINUX 4.02 debian-20101014 ETCDisolinux:Found something at drive=80 isolinux:image checksum error,sorry...
Boot failed:press a key to retry...\"
->Press ->no reaction.
.iso was verified and seems OK.

Would an actual Universal USB Installer version helpful solving this?
Have not tried with burned .iso on DVD.
