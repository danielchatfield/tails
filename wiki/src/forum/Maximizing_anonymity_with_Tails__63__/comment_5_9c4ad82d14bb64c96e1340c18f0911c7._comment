-> There's nothing you can do. The ISP can simply see that traffic is comming out -> from the \"pipe to your house\", and no amount of IP/MAC spoofing can change 
-> that if anything it just looks suspicious). You can, however, hide the fact 
-> that you are using Tor from your ISP by using Tor bridges (or a VPN).

Does that mean, the ISP is normally only filtering connections to all the known Tor relays and does not at all a \"deep packet inspection\" in ordert to detect Tor-traffic?

Thank you!
