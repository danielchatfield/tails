well, obviously i am not mac spoofing myself, so that i will not understand my other self connected to my router. I am just thinking of deniability. For example, if i connect to my router with a wire, a policeman coming to my house will tell me 'it was you', if i connect wirelessly with a different mac than my cards original, i could say some hacker got into my router, check the mac. However i am not sure what constitutes a charge for something, just the IP should be enough to charge somebody with whatever.
You didn't comment on my 'conspiratorial' senario. Common sense would indicate that infiltration and occupation of any and most if not all of anti-system activities on any and every sector and level of life has been either attempted or attempted+succeded by the system's watchdogs. So what would you think if you were in my place? What would you think if you were in an intelligence operative's place?
I am not of course accusing you of anything, how could I? I m just asking my common sense, this simple question: From the post-war times communist and leftist groups had been infiltrated by authorities, or were actually SET UP by the authorities from the beginning, as a real-world honeypot. A honeypot to trap and mislead idealists, or even worse, a counter operation to serve their own power games (operation Gladio). The same applies to everything unfortunately. And they wouldn't \"mind\" that a tool exists that makes hundreds of thousands around the world, stay anonymous? No doubt they would mind, so there is only one possibility: THEY created the tool. Turns out that this is indeed the case, according to the sources. So if i am not mistaken, at the present time, two possibilities exist: 1. THEY still run things, this is the bad senario. 2. you have convinced THEM that they can USE the tool too, to handle their common business of spying and categorizing people and thus can keep it alive. Am i right?
Also, i watched a video from Germany in youtube, a guy with a pony tail gave lecture about Tor and censorship. He kept talking about his epic fights with the Chinese gov geeks and their attempts to block Tor from their country and the same with Iran. So one can't help but make the connection: this guy is acting as if there is a special war with Iran... coincidentaly that is the SAME attitude the official US state has at this moment! Not very reassuring, is it? He was telling that about 5000 people use Tor in Iran and 10000 in China or something, and i am thinking wtf, what is this guys problem, 10000 Chinese among the billions of Chinese, 5000 Iranians among the ..how many, 100 millions? What the hell, is he ..payed to make more Chinese and Iranians use Tor? I mean, i don't really care and i dont want to get political, but what the fuck, if the Chinese as a whole, CARED about what western online news say, then Tor users should be about at least 500 million chinamen! But 10000??? And in the end of the lecture he said something about him later going to talk to some policemen in Germany and that he always loves to talk to police and some such things! Wtf??? Is this a joke? If i was a policeman and a Tor developer came to talk to me about Tor, i would most likely wish to punch him in the face, for providing the tool for internet users to circumvent laws in their browsing... so what other reason would there be? To teach police how to succesfully spy on people using Tor and such, instead of catching real criminals in the REAL world (like for example, the bankers and politicians who are currently driving the west into a deep recession)?
