I burned a number of drink coasters trying to get bootable cds from Tails isos using the GUI tool on Mac.

The following way is foolproof. Open a terminal, cd to the folder where you downloaded tails and and type:

$ hdiutil burn tails-i386-x.xx.x.iso

Done.

This follows on my other recent post answering someone who needed to burn the iso to a usbstick on Mac.
