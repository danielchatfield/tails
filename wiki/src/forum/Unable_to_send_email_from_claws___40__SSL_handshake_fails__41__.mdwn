I have setup a hotmail account and entered its settings successfully in claws so that it recieves email (pop3), however when i go to send it, with the following settings:

apop disabled (claws wont retrieve mail with this enabled)
SMTP auth set to 'login'
authenticate pop3 before sending enabled
use SSL with pop3 (for sending and recieving)

have also tried with with 'use nonblocking ssl' enabled and disabled. I get this message with SSL enabled:

* Connecting to SMTP server: smtp.live.com ...
*** SSL handshake failed
*** Error occurred while sending the message.

If i set it to use STARTTLS instead it tells me im attempting to connect over an unencrypted connection, then it fails. I dont know what else to do.
