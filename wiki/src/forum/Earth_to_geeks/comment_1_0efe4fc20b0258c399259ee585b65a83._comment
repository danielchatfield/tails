When I want to mount an luks encrypted container...

I click aplications ...System Tools... Disk Utility.

then I select the media (usually usb) and click on the encrytped partition, and then the key that says unlock.

It has never failed me, and frankly it is so easy I would have never considered it to be a problem.
