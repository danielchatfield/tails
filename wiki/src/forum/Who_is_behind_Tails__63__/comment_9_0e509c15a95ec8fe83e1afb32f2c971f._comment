A real person, with a real name, has something to loose. Their professional reputation and honor.

Who is more likely to betray? Someone you have name + address + picture or someone you know nothing about?

In any fields, everywhere: Anonymous people are much more likely to do stupid things than known people.

For example I trust Bruce Schneier and Phillip Zimmermann to tell what they feel the truth. I trusted PGP Inc while they existed but never trusted symantec/Google/etc.
