This is good and bad.

You can either trust,
- A reputed company, which might be compromised by NSA etc.
- A well known good person (name). This person can be attacked by NSA etc., kidnapping his child, forcing to collaborate.
- Anonymous people who could be either good guys, who are safe from NSA etc. or could be the NSA etc. itself.
