> We Tails developers have something to lose as well. The identities we use for Tails development are also involved in other projects. For instance, some of us are Debian developers. Of course, if we indeed are NSA agents those things are just a means to our ends (owning you) and hence nothing to lose. So yeah, fair point. Any way, I'd like to claim that accountability (which you're talking about) is a weak basis for trust since the damage has already been done once it kicks in, so everyone that has used Tails up until that point would be screwed.

> Actually I'd almost want to stretch as far to say that it's better that we don't give you our identities and fool you to trust us based on accountability. The human mind tricks us when identity gets involved since it was built for a simpler world than the one we currently live in; we automatically develop trust for an entity as soon as we can put a face on it and believe it's no longer unknown and (hence) a threat, and this is what sharlatans and con men constantly exploit (social engineering if you will). Pseudo-scientific pop-psychology aside, I claim that it's far better to remain rational and cautious and build real, sound trust based on on verifiable claims and public scrutiny.

I really like this answer. The anonymous developer representative sounds very educated. I bet some of us here are used to anonymous forums and discourse (and some of us even familiar with anonymous boards and \"lack of discourse\"). I feel reply to OP by so-called \"developers\" was insightful and critical. I support Tail Dev's claim whether or not they state who they say they are. Unless counter-arguments with claims can be responded (with someone having evidence and knowledge in this domain), the argument Dev makes seems valid.
