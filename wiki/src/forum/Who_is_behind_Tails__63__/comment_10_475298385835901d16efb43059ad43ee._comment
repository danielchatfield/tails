> You must not use that source code to build Tails. You simply have to add a few lines which you never publish and bake it into a binary and boom, compromised.

It's still entirely possible (albeit much work) to verify that we haven't done this:

0. Get the [list of packages installed in Tails](https://tails.boum.org/torrents/files/tails-i386-0.12.packages).
0. For all the Debian packages in the list, download them (e.g. from <http://snapshot.debian.org/> since they may no longer be on the main APT mirrors) and compare the cryptographic hash sums between the packaged files and those included in Tails.
0. For our own packages, well, they are all written in scripting languages so you can just read the source directly from the files inside of Tails.
0. Investigate remaining (i.e. unpackaged) files inside Tails, like application configurations, tiny scripts etc.

Once [[our APT infrastructure|todo/APT_repository]] is in place it'll eventually get easier to build your own Tails with exactly the same packages as any given Tails release we distribute. Then you can just compare one of your own build's contents with the one we ship (comparing the hashes of the images directly won't work since `mtime` etc. will be different for the files inside). This procedure could easily be scripted (and we could provide you with such a script, I suppose) and then it becomes almost trivial to verify that a given Tails release is indeed built from the sources we claim they are.

We Tails developers have something to lose as well. The identities we use for Tails development are also involved in other projects. For instance, some of us are Debian developers. Of course, if we indeed are NSA agents those things are just a means to our ends (owning you) and hence nothing to lose. So yeah, fair point. Any way, I'd like to claim that accountability (which you're talking about) is a weak basis for trust since the damage has already been done once it kicks in, so everyone that has used Tails up until that point would be screwed.

Actually I'd almost want to stretch as far to say that it's better that we don't give you our identities and fool you to trust us based on accountability. The human mind tricks us when identity gets involved since it was built for a simpler world than the one we currently live in; we automatically develop trust for an entity as soon as we can put a face on it and *believe* it's no longer unknown and (hence) a threat, and this is what sharlatans and con men constantly exploit (social engineering if you will). Pseudo-scientific pop-psychology aside, I claim that it's far better to remain rational and cautious and build real, sound trust based on on verifiable claims and public scrutiny.
