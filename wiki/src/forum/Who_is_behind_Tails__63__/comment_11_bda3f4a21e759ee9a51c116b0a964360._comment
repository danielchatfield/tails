I don't think anyone ever verified Tails that way. Otherwise we could read something about it and they would have published their scripts. So it comes back to blindly trusting anonymous developers.

You should post those instructions to the wiki. Encouraging people to verify Tails is a good thing.

Automating the verification process should also be in your own interest. Once someone hacks the build server or download server it's nice to know if you can from your local machine check if everything is still alright.

By the way \"list of packages installed in Tails\" why it's guaranteed it's the same file on the CD? It supposed to be just a help to get most packages verified and than care about the rest?

I like your answer very much, very good answer.
