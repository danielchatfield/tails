> Unless counter-arguments with claims can be responded (with someone having evidence and knowledge in this domain), the argument Dev makes seems valid.

The argument has two parts: attaching a name to the developer identity doesn't bring much for an otherwise known developer (true), and that “verifiable claims and public scrutiny” are good enough for judging the project's quality (in my opinion, false in this case).

I, for one, don't care about developers' names, but I would like to know how knowledgeable they are (and I don't see a reason not to trust their answer). For instance, I suspect that none of the developers have relevant formal education or programming experience (not referring to scripts writing here). There is value in such credentials, however much young people without said credentials might want to believe otherwise.

In addition some questions posed in this thread and later brushed off by Tails developers (in a way too reminiscent of classic butthurt) have merit. For example, if the reason that Tails is implicitly supported by the Tor project (listed on the website, dedicated blog posts, etc.) is personal relations and social interactions, then there is no reason to assign such support any meaning — because then the reason for Tor's popularity (sound research, myriad of publications, famous researchers and developers) is unrelated to Tails' popularity (association with Tor and Debian).
