See the tails-dev mailing-list archive, you'll get a bunch of names.

> May I ask for your reasons to stay anonymous?

Speaking for myself: I don't feel like justifying me.

If you want to know why they signed our role key, please ask them :)

> And I wonder why torproject.org trusts you?

I suggest you ask them :)

> Do they know you in person?

This is none of your business, is it?

> It be nice if you could answer these questions without removing your anonymity. It were interesting if you could offer at least some information.

I don't get what would be the advantage of replying all these questions.
Can you please clarify?
