The trust page is of no help for this question.

Your source code can be 100% clean. I believe it is high quality.

You must not use that source code to build Tails. You simply have to add a few lines which you never publish and bake it into a binary and boom, compromised.

That is where it comes to trust. These kind of things can only be avoided if you know the distributor (=Tails) in person. Or you can play Russian roulette and have still a 50/50 chance.

But if the Debian and the Tor folks know the person(s) who holds the signing key, that should offer some trust.
