lol. How can one relate identity to trust?
Trust is totally different aspect and not related to identity.
Its so difficult to even trust one's husband to be faithful, what the hell would you do by knowing the name & location of a developer/company. how will you build trust with that much information? Do you 'trust' say.. Google? Facebook? Twitter?
