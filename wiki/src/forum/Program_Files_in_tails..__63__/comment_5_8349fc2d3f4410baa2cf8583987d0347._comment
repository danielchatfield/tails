>I load up tails. I click on Computer. I click on the main drive. I click on program files. I see program files that match programs on my main system.

I see. I think.

>I click on the main drive..

At this point you are prompted to enter the Tails session password which you created at the greeter?... if so.. Then at this point you are *mounting* the filesystem on the internal HD of your machine. The internal HD is where your computer stores permanent data such as your OS and personal files.



>I click on program files.

You mean a directory (aka \"folder\") named \"Program Files\"?.. If so..
That name is part of a system filesystem structure exclusive to windows, It suggests that you are in fact browsing a windows filesystem - presumably that of your primary OS

>I see program files that match programs on my main system.

They don't really *match* the programs on your main system... they *are* the programs on your main system... Tails doesn't intrinsically know what you have installed on windows... you are using Tails to mount (the point at which you're being prompted for your password) and then browse the files on your system volume. You are actively using Tails to explore your other OS files... this can be *very* handy for virus/disaster recovery and the like, especially when your windows will no longer boot. Anyone can use *any* live OS medium to do this, provided they have physical access to your machine and can set it to boot from their external medium. e.g. NetBSD, PartedMagic, Grisoft's AVG CD, Ubuntu, Open Indiana, BartPE, Backtrack... even microsoft's own \"recovery tools\" CD... to name just a drop in the ocean.

The implications of this are the raison d'Ãªtre of Truecrypt, LUKS, etc...
