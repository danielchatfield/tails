Thanks.

I'm the OP. Panopticlick tells me I'm one in aprox. 410,000, this seems pretty bad.

I'm reluctant to ask this because it's a step back in usability, but wouldn't it be possible/better to artificially set monitor resolutions in Tails to a few common ones, depending on the ratio of the native resolution ?

And perhaps provide a way to use the native resolution for those that want it, at boot ?
