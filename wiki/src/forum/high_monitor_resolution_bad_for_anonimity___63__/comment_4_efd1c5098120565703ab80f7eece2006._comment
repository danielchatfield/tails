Tor and Tails should warn about resizing the window or going full screen. The following tests didn't usually show results without javascript. Is javascript necessary to detect any of these things? 

All of these values can be changed by resizing the window (if javascript is enabled):

Width 

Height 

AvailHeight 

AvailWidth 

Full screen window? 

Test yourself at <http://browserspy.dk/screen.php>

Also DPI and Logical Resolution:

<http://browserspy.dk/resolution.php>

Why aren't there clear warnings about resizing and/or javascript?

If you disable javascript and you don't resize, can you use a high resolution monitor without making your fingerprint more unique?
