Apparently the browser window should resize itself to 50 pixels multiples automatically, but it doesn't seem to work for me.

Resizing the window (but keeping the high resolution) to 1000x600 is much better : I go from 410000 to 5000 in Panopticlick !

So if limiting the resolution is not option, could Tails be configured to launch Iceweasel with this window size ? Has anybody tested to find what is the most \"anonymous\" window size ?
