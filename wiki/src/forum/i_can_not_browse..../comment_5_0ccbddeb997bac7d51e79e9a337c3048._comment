Hi, ath5k poster! Please don't hijack threads with unrelated questions, it makes it hard to follow discussions.

We have seen problems running wireless adapters with the ath5k driver on Lenny's kernel. Such problems are solved by upgrading to the Squeeze kernel. So: please wait a bit, in a few weeks (maybe two months) a new T(A)ILS release will be based on Squeeze, thus supporting far more hardware devices, especially wireless adapters.
