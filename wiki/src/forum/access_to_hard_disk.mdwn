On my computer, I have partitions on my disk. One for windows (I believe some Gos), on other for shared documents(100 Go) and one for ubuntu (140 Go).
It is not normal that when I use Tails, I can have accessibility to the both first partitions and also permissions to modify and create directories or files. Only the last is protected.
