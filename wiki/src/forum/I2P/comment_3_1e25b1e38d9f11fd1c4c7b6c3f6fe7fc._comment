I dont know any Russian and the machine translation I read was barely comprehensible, so I'm not entirely sure which concerns are raised in that forum thread. A word that was repeated several times was \"external elements\", which I assume refers to html elements (e.g. images) located on the open web in an html page fetched over I2P. Such a page could leak your real IP address to the server admin (if she/he has the access logs of both the I2P host and the open web host) but only if you use a really stupid I2P setup (e.g. you only use the I2P proxy for *.i2p, everything else gets direct Internet access).

In Tails such \"external elements\" would be fetched through Tor, so you wouldn't reveal your IP address. So while this wouldn't deanonymize you it very well could be a strong indicator that you are a Tails user since our Tor + I2P setup may be pretty uncommon.

If there are any other concerns, please post them here or link to sites describing them, but this time in *English*.
