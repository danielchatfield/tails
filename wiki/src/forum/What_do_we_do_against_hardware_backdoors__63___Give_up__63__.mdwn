[Yes. Hardware backdoors exist in reality.](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sps32/ches2012-backdoor.pdf) (pdf) Just read the abstract. [You can choose a online pdf viewer.](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=www.cl.cam.ac.uk%2F~sps32%2Fches2012-backdoor.pdf)

Tails assumes hardware to be trustworthy. Isn't that a bit too easy? Will that still work in a few years?

We can't all create our own hardware. Do you know anyone who can build at least some old shitty like Pentium 100 mhz?

Clever people can make linux distros. (Tails)

Only big companies could build shitty system like Pentium 100 no one wants to use anymore nowadays. Only very very few companies build our modern systems. Where are they produced? China...

If at least our own secret service would place backdoors in hardware. No. It's China. Who was the biggest idiot who put all the production into China? I tell you this is what gets us killed.

What will we do? Watch it do nothing give up? That is what I watch at the moment.

The problem of hardware backdoors is too difficult to solve for clever people. Hardware backdoors are the end to all anonymity tools?
