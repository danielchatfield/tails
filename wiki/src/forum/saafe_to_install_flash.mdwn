first of all ultra warm hearted props for this distribution. if you going real, thats your choice. very good dev-peops, very very good!

sorry to ask here but i didn't find any forum for tor (little bit strange cause quite complex those three letters...)

is it safe to install flash for Tor-Browser?

anyway i give it a shot and try it here.

i want to be able to watch flash with tor-browser-bundele or a linux tor installation using firefox.
is there any chance to reveal my real IP?

and one thing: why do you install open-office? its soo big and there are snall alternatives which work the same way and it would fit on a CD. im just alittle upset to need to burn always on dvd because of 100MB to much for  acd. and its aláºƒays open-office which comes in my mind. but anyway i understand, cause some people need office. but in my opinion could it be the snmaller alternatives like abiword and so on...and it would fit on cd. om enough, thats it.

thanks alot
