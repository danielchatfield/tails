Hi, 

thanks to the developpers of tails: this is such a great project!

One thing I always missed however is the lack of a convenient tails solution on Mac hardware: the natural way of booting a tails live USB thumbdrive doesn't work.

Macs are well known to have problems to boot from USB anything else than OSX itself; they also seem to have a very non standard efi implementation; AMD graphics hardware was especially problematic.

However: yesterday I tried to boot a fedora 18 live USB stick, released a couple of days ago, -- and it worked perfectly. This is a real breakthrough, its the first out of the box USB boot on Mac hardware I know of.

I simply downloaded their Fedora-18-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso and dd'd it right onto the thumbdrive: my macbook pro 8,2 booted perfectly, with the right screen resolution, almost everything worked out of the box, I ended up having a beautiful fedora desktop.

Can someone from the tails team check what fedora did efi- and graphic driver (modesetting)-wise. I imagine that for someone competent it should be easy to reproduce their technique for a tails live USB drive!

This would greatly benefit a lot of mac users, up to now reduced to suboptimal solutions in using tails.

Thanks to everyone for your help and input.
