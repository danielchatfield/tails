Where in the boot sequence did this happen?

Was it before the root user password menu was presented to create a root user password during boot up, or before that?

If you did not create a root user password for the root account - is that what you normally do, or do you always create a root user password as part of the boot up sequence.

The reason I ask is that root's user id is usually 0 which the message clearly calls out as unknown indicating that it may have not been created (I assume).

My best guess is that the root account's user id (0) is necessary in order to  enable MSI-X, and if it was not created, then it would fail.

Please correct me if this is not the case.
