> Where in the boot sequence did this happen?

After a choice \"Tails/Tails (safemode)\" the screen got grey for a second, and then black and first two lines of errors appeared for a fraction of second. And then a black screen with \"loading tails\" and a bar bouncing left-right-left-etc appeared for next approx. 30 second. After that the remaining error line appeared and computer hanged.

Before. The greeter screen never appeared. The computer hanged before the loging screen.

Wow! Yes, it did matter. I normally create root user password. So my fix was: I plugged Tails USB again to one of my other computers and started Tails without creating a root user password. And after closing Tails in the other computers, I put the Tails USB again to my Toshiba laptop. And it worked! :-)

So I guess, my Tails USB stick saves the information about my previous logins - even on other computers. Is it a safe solution (from a privacy point of view)?

Thank you for you questions. They inspired me to find a fix to my problem. Tails boot now on my Toshiba laptop.
