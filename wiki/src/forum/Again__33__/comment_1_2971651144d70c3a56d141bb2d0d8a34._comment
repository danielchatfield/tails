> Again Failed to snychronize the clock!

I am very sorry this happens to you again, but you apparently do know we *already* are well aware about the problem and have gone ways to fix it in the next point-release, so... What kind of good do you think reporting it again, without any kind of debug log or useful details, can do?

We have not decided a release date yet. *Soon* should be correct.

> Thank you!

You are welcome :)
