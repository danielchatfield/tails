A \"java\" is installed as a requirement for I2P but you sound like you want a browser plugin.

>theres a page i want to go to using Tails that uses flash but its not high bandwidth videos

If your Flash object doesn't require Internet you might download it by going to Tools > Page Info > Media, although the object may not be visible without Flash installed. Tails doesn't support VirtualBox but maybe you could run it without allowing the unsafe browser to access the Internet.
