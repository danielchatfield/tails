As Tails points out I think flash can circumvent Tor - however if an anonymous encrypted Internet connection is not a concern, I have flash install itself prior running the unsafe-browser (i.e., in the same chroot jail), presumably also a Java browser plugin could be installed.  To watch a flash video I just run the unsafe browser.

Post back and I'll open a chat room and take you through this (I'm not sure Tails would appreciate the code being posted).
