@ the OP:

Sure, it's a pain to download and burn a copy of the latest DVD iso once a month, but no-one is making anyone use Tails.  If you are using Tails, you probably have a good reason for using Tails.

Frequent security patches and continual development is a very good thing, overall, in a privacy-enhancement tool.  The minor annoyance of making a new DVD once a month or so is neglible by comparision with the advantage of, you know, staying alive on the Internet.
