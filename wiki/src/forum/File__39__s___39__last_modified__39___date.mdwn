hi

first of all, im sorry for the (probably) noob question and for my english

as far as I know, tails is supposed not to write any information on a computer's hard disks except what you explicitly ask it to write, 

but recently I noticed that, when I mount a truecrypt file hosted container and modify a document in it and dismount it, the container's "last modified" date changes, why? isnt tails supposed to write ONLY what I explicitly write, which would mean leaving the last modified date untouched (as if the container file hadnt been modified)? 

and besides that, what else can be leaked when I work with a tc file hosted container that is in the computers hard disk?

thanks
