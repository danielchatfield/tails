Thanks for the prompt reply.

I would suggest adding a note about this to the relevant page.

I used what came with Ubuntu* 10.04.4, which, according to Synaptic, is:

(**and I suspect I am far from alone in that, since TAILS is intended to be easily usable by the typical Ubuntu user.)

**gpgv 1.4.10**

Description in Synaptic:
>GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool

>GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.

>gpgv is a stripped-down version of gnupg which is only able to check signatures.  It is smaller than the full-blown gnupg and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to make the signature are trustworthy.

So perhaps that explains it.
