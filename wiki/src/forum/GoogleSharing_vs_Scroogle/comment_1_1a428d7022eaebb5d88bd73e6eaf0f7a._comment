Have you tried to use GoogleSharing over Tor?

My own experiences were fairly unpleseant: Firefox/Iceweasel completely freezes everytime it needs to access one of Google services. That's for about a second or two, but it is really really annoying.

Those tests were made a few weeks ago, I don't know if the code had changed since.
