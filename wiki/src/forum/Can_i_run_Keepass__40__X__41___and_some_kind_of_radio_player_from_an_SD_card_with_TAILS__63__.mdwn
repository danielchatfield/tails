I was just wondering, most of the time i could get by with just a browser, some kind of password manager, and a radio player app similar to RadioTray - if there was a portable one that i could run from an SD card. So, i would like to run TAILS from a Live CD or USB and then have these other few programs from the SD card.  Can i get some opinions on the advisability of this and any suggestions for a radio app as it seems RadioTray has some dependencies.  I don't do any interesting web surfing and don't live in a country with an oppresive gov't (yet), just gets old that the criminal tracking + profiling companies seem to think its okay to violate everyone's privacy for their profits, without even asking.
