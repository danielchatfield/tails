> What is not supported?

Changing Iceweasel settings is not supported.

> Why do the NoScript settings revert to the defaults each time Iceweasel is restarted?

If you find a way to implement the Iceweasel profile pre-seeding without this restriction, you're much welcome to bring us a patch. We didn't spend too many hours researching such a solution, since the current implementation works fine for the supported usecase.
