Is there a way to get Tails to run entirely in a computer's RAM?  The operating system is under 700 MB, so size is not an issue.  I was thinking of this because of the long loading times when using Tails on a CD.  If Tails were to transfer the entire content of the CD to RAM upon startup, that would solve the problem of the long (and loud) time it takes to read data from the disk.  Is there already a way to do this (e.g. using a command, changing a setting, etc.) or is this a new feature that would have to be implemented in a future update?
