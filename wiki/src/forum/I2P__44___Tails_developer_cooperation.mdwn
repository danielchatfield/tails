In 3 days, I2P v0.9.3 was adopted by 43% of users and currently grows at ~1% per day. That's a fast adoption time and in the world of cryptography I imagine up-to-datedness is important, although, not as important as robustness.

Since an I2P Dev posted here to explain how I2P works, I'm assuming Tails is a worthy market for promoting the ap2pn(Anonymous P2P Network). Is it possible for I2P to inform Tails of a pending update/new dependencies some time beforehand so the Tails devs can weigh the option of delaying a release for a few days and ensuring optimal network interaction?
