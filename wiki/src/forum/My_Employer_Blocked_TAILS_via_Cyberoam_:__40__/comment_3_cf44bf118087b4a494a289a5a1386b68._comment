Is there some rule against using anonymous proxies at your work? If you are certain that they already know then what's the harm in asking your tech support for help? If you are willing to risk doing something you believe your boss would not approve of, why not see how far you can go without being fired? Sounds like a shitty job anyway, maybe you can expose your boss as a control freak and plant the seeds of dissent. If you get fired, can't you collect unemployment? If you want to keep your job, kiss ass and do your investigations on your own time.
