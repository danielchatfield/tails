Please state the approximate size of the ISO file on the \"Downloads\" page.

Could Tails developers also include SHA1 checksum as well? I know that Tails put up SHA256 checksum on its website but SHA256 checksum verifiers are few and far in between. SHA1 checksum verifiers are plentiful on the web.

Moreover, Microsoft publishes SHA1 checksums extensively for its downloadable software for its TechNet, MSDN and other Volume Licensing subscribers.
