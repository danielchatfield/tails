Openvpn is already distributed as a Debian package, so if you want it you can just install it using the synaptic package manager, rather than downloading it from the website.

But Openvpn won't let you use pptp based VPN.

Still if you want a way to configure your pptp connection in a more user-friendly way, it seems you can install `network-manager-pptp` and `network-manager-pptp-gnome` (also by using synaptic). It should provide a GUI way to configure your VPN connection through the network manager applet.

Beware however that using pptp VPN with Tails might not work, we haven't tested it, and tails' firewall might just drop this traffic.

Beware also that pptp VPN has some known vulnerabilities and isn't considered as really secured.
