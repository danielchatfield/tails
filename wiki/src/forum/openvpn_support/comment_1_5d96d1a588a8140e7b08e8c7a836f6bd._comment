I have been looking for a live CD with a preinstalled vpn program so I can use Skype. I haven't used my free 24 hour trial of Patriot Internet vpn service because Patriot Internet uses pptp. Learning how to insall pptp using command lines is too complicated for me. I haven't found a pptp package. Does openvpn come as a deb package? Can openvpn be substituted for pptp?
