Can somone please anonymously post how a Relakks VPN can be added to the Tails connection? It would be very much appreciated in order to have a private and secure connection. One can't understand how to add VPN when the configuration button is not automatically included in the download. How does one use the Synaptic to include a VPN appropriately to make a connection. Would be truly blessed to have someone answer...

Peace.
