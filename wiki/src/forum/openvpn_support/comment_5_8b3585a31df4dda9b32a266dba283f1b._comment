The [[FAQ of Relakks|https://www.relakks.com/faq/qna/]] tells you to use PPTP under Linux, so I guess that the same things as above are true. Not that I never used Relakks nor PPTP through Tails.

However, be aware that Tails and Tor already provides you with a way to hide your IP and stay anonymous online.
