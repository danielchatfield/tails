Linguistics Identifies Anonymous Users

"Researchers have examined writing styles to identify previously anonymous carders and hackers[1] operating on underground forums. Up to 80 percent of users who wrote at least 5000 words across their posts could be identified using linguistic techniques. Techniques such as stylometric analysis[2] were used to track users who posted across different forums, and could even be used to unveil authors of thesis papers or blogs who had taken to underground networks."

Writeprint

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writeprint

"Similar to fingerprint, Writeprint is a term proposed by some forensic linguistics researchers to denote a set of distinguishing stylometric characteristics of a written text (writer invariants) such as "vocabulary richness, length of sentence, use of function words, layout of paragraphs, and key words" which allow one to identify its author (if it is written by a single author).

Metaphorically speaking, a writeprint is like a digital fingerprint. It is suggested that writeprints could provide forensics experts with a new tool for identifying criminals in a digital medium."
