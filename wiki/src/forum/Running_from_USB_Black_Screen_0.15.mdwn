I created a Tails live USB from the live DVD (it would never load properly when creating it with the universal usb installer). Tails will start up properly, goes online, and then the screen goes black. There are no error messages, just a black screen, as if it went to sleep. I am not able to get it back, unless there is a key stroke that I am unaware of. I have seen similar issues, but no solutions. Any help would be great, thanks!
