I installed the original Tails using \"Universal USB Installer\" from pendrivelinux.com on a Windows 7 machine as recommended in the documentation for people who cannot burn a live DVD.

I followed the steps as described in the documentation:

https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/windows/index.en.html

This worked and Tails boots with no problems and all of the other programs in Tails function perfectly.

The only problem is trying to use Tails USB Installer to clone and install itself to a 2nd USB.
