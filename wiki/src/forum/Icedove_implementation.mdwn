Hi Guys and Girls,

I was wondering whether or not you've configured Claws Mail to receive and send through tor. Because if not, well i would like to have Icedove implemented. Not only that it gives you far more ways to be configured, it is also possible to let it connect through proxies and i just love Thunderbird/Icedove it's a pretty handy email client.
