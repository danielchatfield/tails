In PIDGIN, which can be configured easily with TOR, there is no option of pictures sharing which is used routinely. Hence we have to use YAHOO MESSENGER for our conversation with the members of our anti-corruption and anti human trafficking group because it is better to share images instantly over yahoo rather than uploading them onto filesharing sites.

A computer operator working for us told us to use proxifier to proxify yahoo messenger and asked us to use the settings that I am attaching here in the image format.

Kindly check and reply if these settings are safe.
