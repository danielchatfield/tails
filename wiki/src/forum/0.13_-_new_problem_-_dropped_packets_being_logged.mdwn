In Tails' previous version, I never saw any of these, now, they appear just a few times but enough to make me curious and become annoying.

In 0.13 I'm seeing a lot of this:

SRC=127.0.0.1 DST=127.0.0.1 DPT=53

and a few of these:

SRC=myIP DST=aTorNode DPT=443

they're being dropped so I shouldn't care, but I also noticed large changes to the iptables configuration with 0.13 when I:

$iptables -vnL.

why the big change in iptables configuration and why are these entries appearing in my logs?
