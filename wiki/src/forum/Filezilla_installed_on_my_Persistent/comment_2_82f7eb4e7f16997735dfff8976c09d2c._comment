>Is it wrong to do this? 

No... but... you should be very careful when installing internet using apps into Tails as they could leak your IP address. Some things I'd take time to consider:  1. \"Active\" vs \"passive\" connections. 2. NAT - if you're behind one you'll almost certainly be on a common private IP address so, with Tails excellent firewalling, the risks will be *largely* mitigated.

Filezilla is a first rate FTP client but, given the nature and purpose of Tails, I'd be more inclined to \"make do\" with the default tools than to risk my anonymity for the pleasure of using something *a bit nicer* ;o)
