It can be difficult to infer intent from a single forum post.  I was interpreting the OP to suggest that the OP-er has no ambitions to create another distribution, but only wants to try to learn how to verify for himself or herself that his or hers Tails is working properly.

But we need to let the OP speak for himself or herself, since we are both only guessing.

(English is not yet a very anon friendly natural language, how awkward.)
