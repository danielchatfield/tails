Please note that we are not talking of \"the average Tails user\". We're talking of someone who is trying to reverse-engineer the Tails firewall by looking at the `iptables` output instead of reading the design doc or looking at the nice `ferm` configuration file. This seems an unusually hard task to tackle by someone who has apparently never heard of RFC1918, hence my redirect to documentation and homework :)
