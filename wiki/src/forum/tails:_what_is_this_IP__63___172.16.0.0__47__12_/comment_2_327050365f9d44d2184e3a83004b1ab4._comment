172.16.0.0./12 indicates a range of private IP addresses on one of the designated private networks on the computer running Tails.  

Supposedly there is no way in which packets sent on private networks can escape to the internet (absent setting up a NAT gateway), but it seems there is a loophole by which private IPv4 addresses can *also* be valid external addresses.  I don't understand that so I'll leave it to others to comment if they know more.

The Wikipedia article

      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network

lists the ipv4 ranges which are reserved for private subnetworks on any computer.  The best known is probably 192.168.0.0/16.  For example, consumer grade routers often assign themselves standard local IPs such as 192.168.1.0 and then use DHCP to assign local IP addresses to any computers on your LAN.
