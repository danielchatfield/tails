I am afraid we have not scheduled the next version yet.

To be honest, our resources are very limited and we are lagging behind
more often than we would like. Also, it's clear we have been
accumulating some [[broken windows|contribute/roadmap]] for too long.

On the other hand, we have good plans to tackle these issues and
streamline some of the Tails development process so that it is
sustainable. [[Contributing|contribute]] is more than welcome in
any case! :)

> I am a monetary donater you do.

I wonder who you think you gave money to, because until now, the Tails
project has not been open to receive donations yet. Or did
I misunderstood what you meant by \"monetary donater\"?

Thanks a lot!
