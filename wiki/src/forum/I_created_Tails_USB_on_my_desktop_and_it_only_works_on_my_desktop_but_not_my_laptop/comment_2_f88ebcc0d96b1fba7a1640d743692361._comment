If your laptop is setup to boot USB before hard disk in the boot order table in your laptop's BIOS, then if it hangs (as you say), I would try (no guarantee it will work) to hold down both the Ctrl and Alt keys with left hand and with right hand tap the F7 key.

Commonly, I get a Boot error message on a black screen when booting the TAILS USB, and this (Ctrl-Alt-F7) works to continue the booting process for me on my desktop.

Give it a shot to see if it also works in your situation on your laptop.
