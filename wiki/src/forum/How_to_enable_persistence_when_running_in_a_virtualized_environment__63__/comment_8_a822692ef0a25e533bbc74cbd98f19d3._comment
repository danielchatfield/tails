> How to enable persistence when running in a virtualized environment? 

Nothing special from Tails' perspective, but to get there you need certain features in your virtualization software:
* support for USB storage (either completely virtual ones, or real, physical ones that you forward)
* boot from USB storage
Then you just follow the same steps as you would with real hardware, e.g. first boot from a Tauils DVD, install Tails to the USB drive, eject the DVD, reboot.

> Ideally I would like to run tails from a CD image under a virtual machine and link the running instance to a seperate persistance store.

If I understand you correctly, this is not supported (at least so far; see: [[todo/persistence:_support_DVD]]).
