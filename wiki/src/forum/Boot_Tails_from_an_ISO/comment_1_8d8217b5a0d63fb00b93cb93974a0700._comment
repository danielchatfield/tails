Thank you.

However, I'd like to make it clear to every potential user of this unsupported installation method that:

1. The resulting system may, or may not, behave like Tails; differences might be subtle and hard to spot.
2. The resulting system won't be supported by the Tails team. In other words, you're on your own. (Sorry, we cannot possibly support every possible way of installing something that ends up looking like Tails.)

Cheers!
