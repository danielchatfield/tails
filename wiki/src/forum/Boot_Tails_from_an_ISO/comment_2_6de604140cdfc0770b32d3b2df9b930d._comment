Hi,

> The resulting system may, or may not, behave like Tails; differences might be subtle and hard to spot.

You can find a first list [here](https://tails.boum.org/forum/USB_multi-patition__47__multi-ISO_with_Tails___91__Guide__93__/) (of easy-to-spot and not subtle differences).

Moreover, the given tutorial from *rmprepusb* is at least outdated. The GRUB4DOS documentation gives other virtual disknames to map an .iso file without need to rewrite the fourth partition or the partition table! I think this is a very bad tutorial, because it applies the same method for all distros, without taking specificities into account. And... GRUB4DOS is it still maintained?
