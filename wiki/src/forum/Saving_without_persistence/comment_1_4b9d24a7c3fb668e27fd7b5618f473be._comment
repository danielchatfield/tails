Hi,

the user (its login name is amnesia) folder uses the RAM. For
sure, you can create or download files in this folder, but as
you seem to understand, this will be lost at shutdown. 

With Tails (or any other Linux or BSD LiveCD) running from a
LiveCD, there is no way to save something permanently in the
user folder, unless remasterising the .iso image and burning the
new one during the old one is in use (the running session) - and
as far as I know, this is not possible (I can be considered as
an advanced user, but not an expert).

Only the half of the RAM can be used by the temporary filesystem
used by the system and the user to create new files (the system,
for example, can create files in /var/log). If the total amount
of RAM is less or no much more than what is recommended by Tails
developpers (if I recall correctly, its ~750MB), yes, this would
affect the speed (it can even happen that the system freezes).
