Goodness. What an impressive collection. Paranoia, supposition, non-sequiturs, FUD, politics, information, misinformation, disinformation, rhetoric, etc... a veritable pot-pourri of sentences all rolled into a single US-family-sized rambling [narrative](http://diatribe.urbanup.com/2948381). Should be something in there for everyone. You've even managed to embed a little antiquarian US propaganda, along with the obligatory reference to \"the late Aaron Swartz\"! Epic! All with little to *nothing to do with Tails* but carefully tagged onto your usual this-might-look-like-it-has-something-to-do-with-Tails introduction/induction. Have you thought of channelling your energies into a **more appropriate** vehicle? Politics? A blog of your own?
