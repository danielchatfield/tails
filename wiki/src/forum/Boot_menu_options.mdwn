Can someone please provide a full list of boot menu options and what each one does?

I took a look here: tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/index.en.html#boot_menu

Boot options are not all included in that page, such as the one for truecrypt and "toram" options. Furthermore, the mentioned page doesn't provide any explanation for boot option commands.
