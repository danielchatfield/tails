How did you created/installed your Tails USB?

>If you have started Tails, version 0.11 or later, from a USB stick, you can create a persistent volume in the free space left on the USB stick **by the Tails USB installer.** [[Source|doc/first_steps/persistence]]

So if you have another USB stick, you can try to install Tails, from your actual device, to this other USB stick, and then activate the persistence.

Good luck!
