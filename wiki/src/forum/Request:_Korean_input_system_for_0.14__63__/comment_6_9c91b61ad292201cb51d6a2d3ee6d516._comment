SK government wants to track down a particular Tails users from SK and let's say they get the FBI to cooperate. FBI raids tails.boum.org servers in Seattle. They go through the logs and manage to get a list of all IP addresses from SK. SK police go through each entry(OS/browser fingerprinting techniques mean a sufficiently motivated adversary might even be able to determine WHICH version of Tails you're using), issuing subpoenas to SK telecom or whatever, until they track you down.
