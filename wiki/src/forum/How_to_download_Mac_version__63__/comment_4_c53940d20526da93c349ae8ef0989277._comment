I have a 2011 macbook pro, I can boot from DVD but the USB + refit method fails. So if you have a 2011+ mac your probably out of luck too. I found loads of threads about problems booting on mac but no real progress in the last year in solving the issues unfortunately.

Tails - Reading one of the previous threads where a guy called Rod described that the implementation of an EFI bootloader is a potential work around for allowing the USB to boot from reFit on the 2011+ Macs, Did you read this and if so do you think it is a viable solution for you guys to implement an EFI bootloader when creating the tails bootable USB stick?
