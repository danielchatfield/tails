Tails does not support \"old\" (powerpc) Mac hardware. Newer (x86) Mac hardware is more or less supported by Tails, no need to download a special version. You may have a hard time having it boot: Apple hardware is a pain to support, none of us has any, and we rarely get enough input from users to actually do anything about it.
