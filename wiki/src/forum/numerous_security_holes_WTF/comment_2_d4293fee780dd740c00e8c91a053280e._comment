>So you seem to be saying after a short while every release of Tails gewts full of security holes and my anonimity (and my life in some cases) is at risk if I DONT UPGRADE .

No. Virtually all software is \"full of security holes\" all the time. It's just a list of the ***known*** holes which came to light and were plugged during the latest development cycle. Have you read them? They're always *mostly* obscure and/or irrelevant anyway.

>It seems to undermine the very reason Tails exists and worries me a lot

I concur. The phrasing strikes me as a bit melodramatic/counterproductive too.
