Comment 13 raises an issue that I've wondered about all along.

Since:
a) new Tails releases do not (and probably cannot) keep up with \"numerous security holes\", etc., 

and,
b) Manually updating packages within a given Tails release is not recommended or supported

Is it not the case that within a very short time, any given release of Tails becomes vulnerable to \"numerous security holes\"-- at least some which may be, \"pretty serious\"?
