Ok thanks, that is what I thought, it is the phrasing that I was really questioning, I'm aware that software has \"holes\" that get addressed as they are discovered, Its the melodramatic use of language in the notification to upgrade that phraks me a bit, but then maybe saying it that way grabs peoples attention and gets them to upgrade rather than leaving it and becoming vulnerable
