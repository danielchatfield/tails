>the issues fixed in 0.14 are quite real, not merely \"potential\". Some of them are pretty serious.

In that case, shouldn't you be issuing warnings *as the \"pretty serious\" issues are discovered*, and not first once the next release has been announced?

Is it not the case that by the time the new release is announced, the \"pretty serious\" issues in the previous release have been known for quite some time?
