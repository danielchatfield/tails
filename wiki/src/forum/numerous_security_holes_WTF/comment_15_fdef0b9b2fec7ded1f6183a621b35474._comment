>Is it not the case that by the time the new release is announced, the \"pretty serious\" issues in the previous release have been known for quite some time?

Sometimes. They slowly accumulate with time. This is why the Tails team monitor the Debian security announcements, as well as various other channels. It plays an important role in development, timing of new releases and is the reason each new Tails session must (securely and anonymously) check against a Tails server that it is presently deemed safe to use. You can monitor the Debian bulletins *yourself* if you wish. They are published publicly. Tails is based on Squeeze.

Yes. That is, in part, why a method for \"[incremental upgrades](https://tails.boum.org/todo/incremental_upgrades/)\" is being developed.
