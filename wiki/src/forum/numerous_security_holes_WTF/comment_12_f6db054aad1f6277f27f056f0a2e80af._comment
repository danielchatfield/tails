I'm fine with replacing \"security holes\" with \"vulnerabilities\".

On the other hand, the [[issues fixed in 0.14|security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.13]] are quite real, not merely \"potential\". Some of them are pretty serious.

I'm unsure, in the end. Other opinions are welcome. Perhaps this discussion should be moved to tails-dev mailing-list.
