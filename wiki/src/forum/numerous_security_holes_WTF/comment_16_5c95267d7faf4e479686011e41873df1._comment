I notice that liberte linux has far fewer updates, the last being from 2012. I understand that Tails is debian and liberte is hardened gentoo. Can I assume that hardened gentoo requires less updates than debian or is liberte flawed for having far fewer updates than tails? Yes this is a forum about tails, but in deciding to choose tails I need to look at why it does things differently
