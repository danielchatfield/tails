Please clarify:

* Are you addressing the Tails developers?
* Are you referring to announcements of problems in Tails 0.13 which were fixed in Tails 0.14?

Fixing security vulnerabilities is a good thing, in any software.  Fixing information leakages is a very good thing in anonymity-promoting software.  Open discussion of problems and fixes is a very good thing too.

As a rule, regarding computer security generally, almost all experts agree that the biggest threat comes from failure to keep software patched.  For most websurfers, failure to keep browsers, Java, Javascript, flash players patched is especially bad.  This is probably true for Tor surfers too.

(For people running web servers, or hidden services, different problems may come to the fore.)

In short, you should probably download the latest iso image, verify the authenticity (using the Tails signing key to verify the signature of the latest iso image), burn the iso image to a DVD, and possibly create a persistent volume on a USB stick, as soon as a new version of Tails becomes available.  Continuing to use an old version of Tails could be hazardous.
