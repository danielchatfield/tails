The phrase \" numerous security holes\" is ubiquitous in the Debian Security announce mailing list whenever IW/xulrunner are updated.  I think everyone should understand this to mean that the Tails developers worked hard to find and fix all the serious vulnerabilities in the previous edition.

It seems almost inevitable that each new edition of anything complicated will have new and unforseen bugs/vulnerabilities.  The important thing is that developers find and fix them promptly, and then it is up to the user community to promptly adopt the most recent version.

To avoid a possible confusion: Tails is closely based on Debian unix, whereas Whonix is closely based on Ubuntu unix.  Debian employs a system in which the \"stable\" version is older, but security patches are promptly made available, so for Debian, older versions (if fully patched) are generally more secure.  But this model has been challenged in recent years by Firefox adopting a more rapid release cycle; Firefox ESR is too recent an innovation to appear in Debian.  For this reason, Debian advises Debian users who use Tor with IW/Firefox to download the latest Tor Browser Bundle (TBB).  Using the latest Tails should also be good.  In other words, modern browsers are so complicated and so heavily attacked that they deserve to be treated specially, even if this means going outside the invaluable Debian package management system.
