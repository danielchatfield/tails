Everyone has probably seen this but for those who have not, this was one big problem with DuckDuckGo. I'm the one that requested Tails use ixquick.com (startpage.com) and dump Google, and now it seems we have the same problem. At least startpage.com supports privacy when google capitalizes on no privacy. 

A new identity a couple of times didn't work for me. What about changing the proxy settings as suggested? Would this be an ideal combination of Startpage and tor? We could use Startpage to search and surf the proxy results and then go out of its proxy by clicking unproxy results when we want to interact with the web through Tails. Secure?

This is the startpage.com message:

Are you using Tor?

Welcome to Startpage, the world's most private search engine.

    We do not store anything about you — not your IP address, not your search queries
    We encrypt all traffic — using HTTPS, so even your ISP canâ€™t snoop on your searches
    Our privacy protections are third-party certified — we are the only search engine with third-party certification
    The E.U.'s privacy organization has certified us — no other search engine offers EuroPrise-certified privacy, and our systems are regularly audited to confirm this compliance 

Occasionally, Startpage may not return results with Tor.
This happens when many Tor users are searching through the same end node, and Startpage cannot determine whether the searches are originating from automated screen-scraping programs.

Here's what to do when this happens:
If you use the Tor Browser Bundle:

    Switching to a new Tor identity is easy and fast: click the green onion icon next to your address bar, then click "New Identity", and try your search again. In some cases, you may have to switch identities more than once for this method to work. 

Or, if you use Firefox and the Torbutton:

    For a more permanent solution, you can instruct Firefox to use Startpage without its proxying. This is safe because Startpage encrypts your searches and does not store any personal data. To do this, go into the Firefox Options, click the "Advanced" tab, click "Network," then click "Settings". Then just add ".startpage.com" to the "No Proxy for" field and click "Ok". You should now have no problem using Startpage with Firefox and the Torbutton! 

We apologize for the inconvenience! We support the Tor project's privacy mission and have dedicated ourselves to delivering a private and secure search experience. We'd love to hear from you; Thanks for supporting Startpage and Tor's mission of a search engine and Internet that honor your privacy.
