After a quick look, it seems to me Tails does not ship the GNOME friendly userspace tools to manage bluetooth. As far as I can remember, we've not thought through nor discussed what it would involve / require to do so, and what kind of risks it may open. That's why I just added a [[todo/support bluetooth?]] page to our TODO list.
