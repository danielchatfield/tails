It stands to reason that before long there will be a message about which ever version you are currently using


Now that I know the software I am using contains inevitable "numerous security holes", can someone please explain how this effects security online?

Can an adversary of power simply find the vulnerabilities before Debian and exploit them on mass, resulting in TAILS being an open book for such as  government and local police force ?

Can a vulnerability be selected from a previous release and explain how TAILS users could have been effected while they were (previously) using the software (worst case scenerio)
