Am I reading this right? Is Tor, and by extension, Tails, pointless against a "global adversary"? 

Surely, at least some of us would like to protect against intrusion from "global adversaries" and everyone else, I would have to think.

In the Tails documentation, it says:

"Tor doesn't protect you from a global adversary"

And goes on to say:

"A global passive adversary would be a person or an entity able to monitor at the same time the traffic between all the computers in a network...

It is part of Tor's initial trade-off not to address such a threat..." 

But wouldn't threats like that have the potential to be the biggest of all?

It seems to me the USA government, China, and the UK, if not others, at least qualifiy as having the resources to be a "global adversary".

Since the Tor Project admits not even "addressing such a threat", are we really just like a bunch of kids playing spies, thinking we are doing something, while in reality being just a joke to the (ever more police state) powers that be, who could probably "pwn" us at any time?
