It's hard, if not impossible to draw one-size-fits-all conclusions on this topic.

It all depends what web sites you're visiting, what external resources their pages have your web browser fetch, how much you trust these websites owners and administrators (+ external resources' ones + the SSL cartel) more than the random exit node administrator.
