OP's main, most important question can probably be boiled-down to:

*Can Tails/Tor be used to visit NON-SSL (HTTP) with any reasonable degree of safety?*

Or, put another way,

*If a site doesn't support SSL, is it basically out of the question for the Tails/Tor user, for all practical intents and purposes?*
