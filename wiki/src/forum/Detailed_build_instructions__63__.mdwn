Is there any chance of getting detailed build instructions for Tails? I want to be able to make my own using an encrypted root USB setup and have full control over it. 

It would also let me understand Tails better. 

I've tried Liberté Linux and don't like what they did to make root hard to use and am worried Tails is going in the same direction. Liberté doesn't even have vi! I want enough information so I can make my own build.
