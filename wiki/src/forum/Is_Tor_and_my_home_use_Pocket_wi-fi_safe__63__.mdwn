Might really be a stupid question,

So I have two laptops and one I use only for tails to access deep web and the other one for family use. They are both connected to this pocket wi-fi and I was wondering if its safe to use tor thru tails with the same connection where my family and I are sharing personal information online.(like email address, bank account and etc...)
