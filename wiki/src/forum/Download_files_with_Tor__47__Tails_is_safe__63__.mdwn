Will a source website know my original IP when I download a file using Tor/Tails? (Can be any file like .zip / .doc / .pdf etc.)

And what about uploading files in general? Does the original IP leak when uploading?

I know that saving a .doc or .pfd file and opening it directly while being online is NOT safe because some files can phone home. But what about just downloading it? So only 'Save file as'. Can only downloading the file with Tor also reveil the original IP?

Thanks 4 your answers!
