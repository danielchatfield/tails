Both Tails and Liberte Linux has extensive firewalls. Tails' firewall blocks all incomming Traffic, and [[only allows Torified traffic to exit the computer|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement#index3h1]].

If you ran this in Tails your accessed <grc.com> through Tor, so the results you see are for the Exit node you were using at the time. You are anonymous when using Tails, remember. :)
