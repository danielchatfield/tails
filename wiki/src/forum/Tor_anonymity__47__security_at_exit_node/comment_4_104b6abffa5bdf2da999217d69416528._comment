>email via an email client has SSL/TLS for communication with the email provider (i.e. to encrypt your login details)

So using SSL/TLS for both incoming and outgoing email encrypts only the username and password, not the text?

Is that the same for a webmail service that uses https?

If that is true, then the only way to encrypt text in an email message, whether by webmail or email client, is by using something like OpenPGP?
