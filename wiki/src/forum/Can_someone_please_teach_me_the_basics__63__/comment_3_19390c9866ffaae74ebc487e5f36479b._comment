if you are total newbie to anonymity then try vidalia or tor browser on your existing os. You can get it from www.torproject.org

Dont use tails without understanding how it works, its pros & cons. It uses Tor for anonymity. Almost all tor exit nodes are blacklisted by major companies. So, you might face problem using google services, bank interface, etc.
Also, you might attract unnecessary suspicion from authorities as exit nodes are shared by tor users. So, use only after proper understanding of tor network.
