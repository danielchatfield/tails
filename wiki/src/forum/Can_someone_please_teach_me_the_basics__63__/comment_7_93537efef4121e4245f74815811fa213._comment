I would like people who affirm things like \"Almost all tor exit
nodes are blacklisted by major companies\" on the Tails forum to
back such affirmations with facts, because:

1. It does not match my own experience at all: I've been using
   many services run by \"major companies\" over Tor for years, and
   have been blocked due to using Tor pretty rarely.
2. I think it is a disservice made to the Tor network, and hence
   to Tor users, to take the risk to scare people away with such
   slightly exaggerated statements. Which is why I used the
   word \"FUD\" initially.

This being said, reading the whole thread again, I agree
I overreacted somehow, and I apologize.

Cheers!
