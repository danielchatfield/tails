I suggest TAILS take a long hard look at some of the comments made in this forum  signed with its name. I think a lot of damage is possible to the \"TAILS\" reputation. I look at this post as a good example of what I don't like in TAILS commenting. 

My opinion of the previous blog is what appears a genuine attempt to help. 
Tails can start by choosing more appropriate words to use than \"FUD\" 
Besides the fact that it's not an actual word I find it inflammatory and unhelpful. 

Perhaps TAILS could set an example in \"Clarity\" by first clarifying what it is that they want clarified.

Most of all I would ask that TAILS set an example as to how comments should be made, constructive and informative.

 If there is a comment which is believe to be inaccurate, a simple statement of the correct facts should be sufficient.
