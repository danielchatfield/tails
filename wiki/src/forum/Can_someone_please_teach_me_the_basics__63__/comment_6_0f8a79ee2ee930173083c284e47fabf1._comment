True, but overall, Tails coments are quite considerate and not at all problematic.

While not dimissing your points, I would like to point that some latitude is always helpfull, as Tails moderators are people and people are not perfect.

And they give us Tails :) for which I am very gratefull :) 

Still there is room for improvement in all of us, no doubts about that. And we should always strive to make our coments better, more helpfull and less afected by the frustrations of life :)
