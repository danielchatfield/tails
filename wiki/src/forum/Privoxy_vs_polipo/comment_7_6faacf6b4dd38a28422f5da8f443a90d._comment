Polipo breaks downloads above a certain size, even if you amend its caching settings to try to fix this.  It's a fucking broken program.  Since there is some potential advantage in having applications bind to localhost (and hence using a loca l proxy), and Privoxy is tried and tested with Tor a zillion times, then really is no good reason to not implement Privoxy.
