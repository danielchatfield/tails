If you want to be 100% sure you have a genuine tails version then yes.

Then i can compare those images if they are all the same.

While doing that would certainly heavily decrease the chance that the download you got was compromised it would still be theoretically possible to replace all of the mirrors files which would make that technique not work, that is extremely unlikely though so you'd be pretty safe doing it that way.

It is also theoretically possible for an ISP to monitor your connection and serve you a maliciously modified version of tails regardless of where you attempted to download it from, this is again though extremely unlikely and only mentioned to note that it is theoretically possible to do.

Actually the cryptographic signature method would still be helpful because any change to the iso file would remove its signature and therefore make it not validate.
