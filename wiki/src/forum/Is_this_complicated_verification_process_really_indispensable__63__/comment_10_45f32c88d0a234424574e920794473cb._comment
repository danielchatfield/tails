>Yes, I'm lame...

Not lame. Indolent. Indolent and insolent.

>I could not find a single mention in your post of establishing trust in the TAILS signing key.

[RTFM](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html)

>Without legitimately establishing such trust, how much better is verifying a signature than the method described by the OP?

You could, if you were *genuinely* interested, establish your own trust by a process of [correlation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html#index1h1) perhaps combined with similar correlation of and then verification with the Debian keys. Something you couldn't do with anything as crude and temporal as a naked release digest.

>OP here

>All right then. What have we got here: some philosophy about the probability, one moderate butthurt, and a discussion containing some magic spells.

[You](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Checksums_for_0.14_RC2-_Let__39__s_Compare/) must be the only person on this forum who didn't know exactly where you were going with this. Right from your opening post.

>Still dunno what cryptographic signature is for, and how it and other two items link with each other (PGP key and the ISO image).

>But I guess..

Well what a surprise. Flatly ignore what everyone's kindly explained to you and push on in error and ignorance.

>Wish me luck.

Oh dear no. I'm afraid I can't do that. I can't bring myself to wish \"the troll\" any such thing. *Glioblastoma* will have suffice?

I wish you Glioblastoma.
