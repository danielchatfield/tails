@comment 2:

I could not find a single mention in your post of establishing *_trust_ in the TAILS signing key*. 

Without legitimately establishing such trust, how much better is verifying a signature than the method described by the OP?

Or even than simply using the sha256 hash provided by the TAILS devs on this site?
