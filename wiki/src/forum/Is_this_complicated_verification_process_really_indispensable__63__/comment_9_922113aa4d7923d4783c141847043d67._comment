All right then. What have we got here: some philosophy about the probability, one moderate butthurt, and a discussion containing some magic spells. Still dunno what cryptographic signature is for, and how it and other two items link with each other (PGP key and the ISO image). But I guess that the main difference between the standard verification process and the one which I proposed is that you don't have to deal with many ISOs but just a small keys which you can easily compare and (if you are lucky) you can get confirmation of their authenticity from the first hand. Comparing ISO images may require more time and effort but seems that eventually ends with a similar result.

The best what I can do is to obtain few ISOs via TOR and see if they are the same, and visit some internet cafes and (if possible) burn the DVD on the spot, so the files cannot be changed later whatever will happen. If I will end with couple of identical DVDs it will be fine. Of course there will be still a tiny possibility that my ISP will redirect me to the fake file every time or my viruses will change them after downloading and that there is a huge conspiracy plot which allows to get only fake Tails in the whole country. Such plot would easily fail since all what is needed is for example the one who will find out (during the standard verification) that the PGP keys are fake. Since I didn't saw the proposition of \"alternative verification\" before I assume that everyone was verifying Tails normally to this time. Taking this into consideration (and that I don't live in North Korea) I can say that probability of getting fake Tails in this way is not greater than being hit by a meteor or winning a lottery. Since I can sleep well not concerned about the meteors and I don't count on winning $1000000 in near future I think I can accept this level of safety.

It may not be the best way but seems rather simply and not sophisticated, and what is simply is hard to screw up. Alternatively I could follow the instructions doing things i don't understand. But I guess it's better to know what you are doing. Maybe there will turn up someone willing to sacrifice his time to convert these instruction into lame-readable form, maybe not. At this time I'm going to get Tails in the primitive way.

Wish me luck.
