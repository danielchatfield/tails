This is a repeat of my post of the 29th April.

If any one can help me this matter please do.

Am grateful any advise suggestions



I have downloaded v11 manually installed onto a USB stick booted up Tails and then installed (via Tails USB installer > Clone and install) on to a 2nd USB stick. 

Closed down.

Successfully rebooted Tails from the 2nd stick. Am now in Tails v11 from the 2nd stick. Started Application > Tails > Configure persistent volume. Wizard comes up.

Entered the password and confirmed and let it run. 

Creating the persistent volume comes up and then "Failed org.freedesktop.DBus.error.noreply Did not receive a reply."

Have tried many times with the same result.

I can strangly delete this volume (which the error message said that creating had failed) and if I do so can still rebook into Tails using this second stick. If I just close down then cannot boot from it (as noted in documentation)

I would really appreciate any help at all this matter.
