I am trying to download t from the library fearing all this internet stuff like isp's and stuff. I'm not exactly sure what I'm scared of with downloading it out in the open or doing stuff without t but I feel like just incase I do all this stuff. I'm not very knowledgeable about the technical stuff about networks and computers but it seems to be a concern so I'm concerned and have been paranoid for a while now. Wish someone could help me with my fears to at least get them in order so I know what I'm even fearing and what to do about it but anyways (I'm not a full adult by the way). 

I guess my concern with downloading it at the library is I'm doing it because I fear the isp concern (live in USA if that helps) but another thing is I connected my flash drive to the computer and it auto downloaded the driver so is there some sort of mac address tracked now or something?
