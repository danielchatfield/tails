I have used DownThemAll, a firefox addon download manager and essential for downloading larger files, 30mb plus, as one as able to resume. I install it once tails is running from inside Iceweasle, It does not stay installed and has to be re-installed each time I use tails but it doesn't take long so no problem. 
My question is , is it safe to use DownThemAll, ie, will it be running through tor by default as I assume.?

Second question, are there any plans to include a download manager in tails anytime soon, like uget in liberte linux. It would be very useful addition.
