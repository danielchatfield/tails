if it doesn't contain Tor 0.2.2.39, I won't use Tails' new version, and neither should you because:

\"All of the available bundles of Tor have been updated for the latest stable Tor 0.2.2.39 release and the 0.2.3.22-rc release. These releases fix a remote crash bug found in Tor and all users and relays are STRONGLY encouraged to update immediately.\"

let's hope they use the newest stable version, then, unless they want this remote crash bug (and anything else which could be wrong in previous versions) to exist in their new release!
