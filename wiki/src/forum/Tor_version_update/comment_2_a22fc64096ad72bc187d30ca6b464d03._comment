Hello! Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of Tails! :D

You don't exactly \"install\" Tails - it's a \"live\" system with *optional* persistence.

If you'd like to test the forthcoming 0.13 release, you can snag a copy of rc1 [here](http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/testing/)

The final release should be along imminently.
