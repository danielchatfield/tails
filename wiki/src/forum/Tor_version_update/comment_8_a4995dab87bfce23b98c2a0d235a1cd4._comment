>I think the reason they wait so long to patch security holes in Tails is so the authorities can take advantage of it for awhile, why else would they wait so long to give critical updates?

\"security holes\"? \"critical updates\"?

There's a possible remote crash (i.e. DoS) attack against the version of Tor in the current Tails. Hardly what you assert though.

Please justify your aspersions.

>I swear everytime I start tails its always connecting to the same nodes caoscomputerclub, bigboy, ect located in germany the US and UK, ect how is this supposed to be anon if its always connecting to the same nodes, like the list is the same nodes over and over again in the view network panel,even if I restart tor or restart tails always the same nodes? why doesn't it mix it up? but this only happens with Old Tor versions, so im thinking it is a security issue that is being taken advantage of.........

Nodes are selected by performance. Better performing nodes receive greater patronage from all the network, not just yourself. The algorithms which accomplish are, like all of Tor, under development. If you would like to present a thesis regarding this design, perhaps you should address your concerns to the Tor development community.
