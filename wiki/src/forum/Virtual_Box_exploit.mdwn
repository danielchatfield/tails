If I ever came across a malicious website while browsing the internet using Tails inside Oracle's virtual box. and if said website contained an exploit to break out of virtual box, would this type of attack require an Iceweasel exploit FIRST and then a VM exploit, or would it be possible for an attacker to break out of the virtualization environment directly?

Also, can exploits affecting other oracle products be used against Virtual Box?
