I am able to connect without having to make any changes.
Running
 
 root@admesia:/home/amnesia# ssh dell@angelxxxxxxx.org
 dell@angelxxxxxx.org's password:
 Welcome to Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-32-genericpae i686)

 Last login: xxxxxx
 dell@angelxxxxx:~$

SO I don't think it is the SSH.  However seeing a TTL expire usually means you are in routing loop.

HTH.
