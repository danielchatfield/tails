From the linked forum thread:
> 1) End Nodes are vetted before being allowed on the network. This is down through a series of checks. While the main source is open the end nodes would be closed source and ONLY those version (which generate a unique ID/Key) can act as an end node.

These seems to be the main \"improvements\" over the existing Tor network. So what does it mean? It only pushes the trust from the exits to the operators of this new, \"improved\" Tor network. From a cautious user's perspective this doesn't solve anything as you should never trust neither the exit nodes nor the path between them and the destinations. You know the mantra: always use end-to-end encryption and authentication (e.g. https, SSL/TLS, GPG etc.)! It remains true in all situations, and giving the users a false confidence/trust in the network simply damages there security. Remember: \"it is only that which you trust that can hurt you\".
