Interesting link. Link referred Redphone. Redphone encrypts calls on  Android phones. I do not understand how Redphone could be used with TOR. It would be wonderful if Tails included a VoIP which could call phones. I read Skype has a back door.  Only live  CD distros I found that have Skype preinstalled are PCLinuxOS, Extix and Mepis. However, these live distros do not have TOR preinstalled. I do not know how to download and install a program to a live CD.  Puppy has links to Skype and TOR but  they are not preinstalled.

Does anyone know of a live CD with preinstalled GNU Free Call? I recommend Tails to include GNU Free Call in their next upgrade.
