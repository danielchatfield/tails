You misunderstand,

the entire thing is open source EXCEPT the keys that allow for end nodes to be end nodes. this way ONLY vetted users can be end nodes. To become vetted you must under go a process. There will be a version that will allows any one to be an end node (for those who don't trust us). This version will still have the other improvements.
