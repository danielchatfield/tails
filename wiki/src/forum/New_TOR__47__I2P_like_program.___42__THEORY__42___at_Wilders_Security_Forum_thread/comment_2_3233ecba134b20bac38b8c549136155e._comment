I replied to your post in that thread and thought I would post it here too:
I Will definitely keep that in mind. I personally love TAILS and use it all the time when I need to surf anonymously . What I mean by RedPhone is a similar VOIP service. The service would something like: http://zfoneproject.com/getstarted.html

It encrypts the entire conversation using the OTR protocol and RFC 6189 -- ZRTP: Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP created by Phil Zimmerman. They also use a unique anti-MITM technique where users compare a challenge and response displayed on the screen.

I hopping to integrate something like this into the network. That way the calls would not just be encrypted but also completely anonymous and nearly impossible (if not impossible) to trace back to the source(s).
