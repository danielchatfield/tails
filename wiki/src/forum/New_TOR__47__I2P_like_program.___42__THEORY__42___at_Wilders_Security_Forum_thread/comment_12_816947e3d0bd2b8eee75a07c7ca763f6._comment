Every VoIP software system has backdoors or the ability to be compromised easily. The only solution is a vocoder box with hardware encryption for true end to end, nothing else can be trusted especially Skype. Backdoors galore.

Redphone and TextSecure, and all the other encrypted apps Moxie Marlinspike/Thoughtcrime labs released are all dead since twitter bought them. Can't even find them in the Android store anymore it's proprietary software and undoubtedly filled with NSA backdoors. Proprietary corporate encryption < free software not aids riddles by NSA
