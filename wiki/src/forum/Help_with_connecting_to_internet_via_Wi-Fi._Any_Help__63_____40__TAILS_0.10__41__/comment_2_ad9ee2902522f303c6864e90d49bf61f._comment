Thanks for the response but i decided to run it on my MacBook and it works perfectly. :)

Could you please help me to install the tails-i386-0.10.iso on an USB Stick such that there are 2 volumes \"tails_os\" and \"other\"? I want to boot from \"tails_os\" and be able to save files on the volume \"other\".

Thank you for your time :)
