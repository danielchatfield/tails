Quick and Dirty, since this is off tppic, AND, if I understand you correctly that is :D

The in-addr.arpa resolution works like this. Suppose you have a local C class network - say - 192.168.1.10. Reverse it: 10.168.192, and add \"in-addr.arpa\". You'll get something like this \"10.168.192.in-addr.arpa\"

If I understand you correct you have two 192.168.x.x routers behind each other. It seems both are using the same ip range for automatic ip distribution (to a pc). This may cause a conflict between DNS and reverse DNS on both routers, which seems to be \"corrected\" with a \"seperate\" reverse DNS trajectory.

First you might check the ip range to be distributed by your routers. Depending on the brand you might find a setup menu where you can define an \"internal\" LAN address range. Like - say - 192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.20

Try looking at the DNS chain in your network from pc to the \"internet\"

Say your ISP DNS addy is 8.8.8.8. On the WAN side of the FIRST router you point to 8.8.8.8. On the LAN site of the FIRST router you make your DNS - say - 192.168.2.1. On the WAN side of the SECOND router you point your DNS to 192.168.2.1. On the LAN side of the SECOND router you must pick an \"out of range\" DNS address, say 192.168.3.1, and let the pc use that last DNS address.
