I think the Tails documentation should include at least some introductory info on the threats of BIOS and other hardware/firmware threats (rootkits and other malware that can infect routers, video and sound cards, etc.). Some idea of who needs to be concerned, means of detection and prevention, etc.

This is because (as should be quite obvious) the whole purpose of using Tails would be defeated if it were to be used on a system compromised by one of the aforementioned threats.
