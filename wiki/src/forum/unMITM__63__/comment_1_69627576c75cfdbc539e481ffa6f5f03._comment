A man-in-the-middle can happen thousands of miles away from your computer, or as close as your neighbor. When the attack starts, or it's duration is everyone's guess.

It is somewhat possible to detect it, by verifying the website https certificates. Same for the GPG / PGP keys. It may be wise to disconnect when \"weird\" details are shown.

You might consider avoiding all \"clear\" traffic by using specialized add ons or tools.
