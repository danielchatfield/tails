> Is there something that can work as well when the machine is MITM compromised? Is there anything we can do to unMITM if we suspect our connection is MITM compromised?

If it's outside of your control... No. Your ISP can/could MITM you every day and you could do nothing. You can maintain your message contents encrypted (gpg) but anonymity becomes difficult once you are targeted.

Do they target you directly or do they run the MITM against everyone?

Best thing you could do would be using a different connection.
