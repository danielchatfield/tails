Thanks for the comment, Anon. I'm not sure which \"specialized add ons or tools\" but one reason for wondering is the following:

C:\Windows\system32>tracert www.google.com

Tracing route to www.l.google.com [173.194.39.17]
over a maximum of 30 hops:

  1    <1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  router.room [192.168.2.1]
  2     9 ms     7 ms     8 ms  1.192.65.10.in-addr.arpa [10.65.192.1]

There are two routers here, one behind the other. the one directly connected to this box is 192.168.2.1, and the other address is 192.168.0.1, but that hop 2 above is strange. Pings to both 192.168.2.1. and 192.168.1 work fine, though when trying to access the furthest router eariler, it wouldn't let me and it was necessary to reset it so 192.168.0.1 would work to access it. There is more to the tracert:

I don't think I've ever seen so many in-addr.arpa before if ever. Could something be trying to reverse DNS and log the addys?

There is more.

So what is 1.192.65.10.in-addr.arpa [10.65.192.1]?

Anyone? Thanks.
