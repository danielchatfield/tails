> Does this mean the fingerprints are identical? I thought this way technically unfeasable.

The short answer would be \"no\".

But there's no such thing as *the* fingerprint of a web browser, be it TorBrowser or Tails' current web browser. The closer you look, the more identifying bits you get, and the smaller the anonity sets.

So, at *some* scale, the answer is \"yes\", and at some other scales, the answer is \"no\". Next thing to do: [[todo/evaluate_web_fingerprint]].
