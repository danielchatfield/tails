I am really awed by the discussion here but honestly it just confuses me.

For a noob like me, all I wish to know is whether the website that I visit will be able to obtain the following information:

1. My current location, ie. country/city/town
2. My MAC address, even though I manage to change my MAC using sudo macchanger
3. My ISP
