The following icons are present on a standard Tails desktop using Windows XP camouflage:

* My Computer
* My Documents
* My Network Places
* Recycle Bin

As far as I can tell, they all have the corresponding icons from Microsoft Windows XP. Hence I fail to see the issue you're talking about, so can you please elaborate?
