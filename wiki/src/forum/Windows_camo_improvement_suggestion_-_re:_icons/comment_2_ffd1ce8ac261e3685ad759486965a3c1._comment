I think that the author was referring to the icons in the system tray, not the desktop icons. The system tray icons are the same as in a Linux GUI, which puts a big hole in the windows camouflage fa√ßade. Also, I noticed that the Start menu was very different from actual Windows. I think that the menu should be modified a bit to resemble a Windows XP one. 

I'm just sayin'.
