I can confirm that Tails 0.13 is the first release since Tails 0.10 that I was able to boot successfully on a late 2010 MacBook Air with Mac OS X 10.8.2 installed. I've used one USB flash drive with rEFIt, due to FileVault disk encryption, and one USB flash drive with the Tails image created by UNetbootin.
