I've tried with 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 and couldn't get it to boot either.
I came kind of came close once with refit or some other boot manager, but then it failed at some later point of the boot process (debian boot progress bar just froze).

I've talked to the Tails' developers about this, they know of our Mac troubles, but can't do much about it because their time is very limited. Please, someone with expertise in both distro development and the Apple world, join the devs to help them.
