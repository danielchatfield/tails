eh, i get similar on a Samsung netbook fwiw.  i used XBOOT to make a USB with only TAILS on it and the last few days it worked fine then today first 2 attempts at boot left me at that screen that has buttons for YES NO START iirc and the screen starts blinking and the cursor freezes.  This could be a problem to Samsung netbooks specifically though as i've had similar problems in ubuntu before.

tried a 3rd time today and it booted fine. i think if i just used a CD instead of a USB that it might always work though because i've had similar problems with Clonezilla on XBOOT (works fine the first time but not too well after that)
