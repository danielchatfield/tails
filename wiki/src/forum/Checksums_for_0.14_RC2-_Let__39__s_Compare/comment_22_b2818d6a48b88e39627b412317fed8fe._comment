>this is in Tails-iceweazel btw

It isn't clear to me exactly what you mean here but I hope you realize the following:

1.) You cannot verify a given version of TAILS (or any other distro)  from *itself*. 

You can only verify an ISO (or any other type of file) from an *trusted* operating system-- i.e., an OS that you installed from an ISO that you had verified the authenticity of.  

2.) The actual verification process itself does not involve a web browser.
