Go out into the  street and ask a 100 people to do 1. They won't have clue what your talking about. It needs to be : 1. download this , 2. then this, 3. do exactly this etc.

\"Using Linux with Gnome: Ubuntu, Debian, Tails, Fedora, etc.

You need to have the seahorse-plugins package installed. If you're not sure or want to install it, under Debian, Ubuntu or Tails you can issue the following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install seahorse-plugins

The development of seahorse-plugins has stopped. It hasn't been ported to Gnome 3. It is no more available on Debian starting from Wheezy and Ubuntu starting from version 11.10, Oneiric Ocelot. If you can't install it please try verifying the ISO using the command line.\"

I tried to do the above originally. The terminal commands downloaded a ton of stuff and I ran out of RAM. dead end.

So this time, left that out (never really knew whether it wwas needed anyway - this is in Tails-iceweazel btw), but the second stage (verify signature) gives a different dialogue box to that depicted, with only option to save; the example given is not the save option. 

Bollox! better things to do.
