The procedure basically boils down to:

1. Install any software capable of verying OpenPGP signature, usually GnuPG. *This only needs to be done once.*
2. Import the signing key in the keyring and establish some level of trust to it. *This only needs to be done once.*
3. Download the image and the signature.
4. Use OpenPGP software to verify that the signature is correct *and* has been made by the aforementioned signing key.

It's hard to see how those four steps could be hard to understand. If you have concrete suggestion on how to improve the documentation, they are welcome!
