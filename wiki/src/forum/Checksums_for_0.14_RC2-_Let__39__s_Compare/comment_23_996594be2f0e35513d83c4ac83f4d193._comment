>Bollox! better things to do.

I understand your frustration but you must realize the importance of verifying the authenticity of a download such as a TAILS ISO:

-using a compromised/trojan version of TAILS can be worse than not using TAILS at all

-if an ISO file became corrupted while downloading, it will not function properly when installed
