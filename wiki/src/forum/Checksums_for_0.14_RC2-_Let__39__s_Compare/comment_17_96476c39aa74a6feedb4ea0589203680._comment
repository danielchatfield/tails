I've tried to understand this process for days. Part of the problem is the instructions aren't sequential. You jump sideways to other links with partially irrelevant material, half the time I don't know whether somethings an alternative or part of the sequence and my brain overheats trying to hold all this info in, in parallel. I tried doing it in Tails and ran out of memory (the laptop, that is :)). The Mac version required fixing the OS, (no thanks). And in windows, I couldn't import the certificate into Kleopatra - \"imported : 0\". Wondering if it's because it's a notepad file. I saved it as '.gpg'
