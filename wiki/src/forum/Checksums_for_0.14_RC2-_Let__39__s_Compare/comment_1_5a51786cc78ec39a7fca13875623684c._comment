So why are you wasting your *and others'* time FFS? 

>But they can be somewhat useful as one of several indicators....and since no method alone can truly be 100% failsafe, etc....

This is incorrect. What you persist in attempting to do on this wiki is of **NO** value. No, \"no value\" isn't quite accurate. What you persist in attempting to do is **a danger** to anyone else who doesn't understand or can't be bothered to verify their downloads correctly. You are just some halfwit pushing [snake oil](http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/snake%2Boil?region=us&q=snake+oil). Please stop!

>(If a consensus is built and someone finds their sums differing from the consensus, then it would be cause for concern)

No it wouldn't. It would do **nothing more** than illustrate the obvious: That what you keep doing is **moronic**. Learn to use PGP and/or [RTFM](https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#authenticity-check)
