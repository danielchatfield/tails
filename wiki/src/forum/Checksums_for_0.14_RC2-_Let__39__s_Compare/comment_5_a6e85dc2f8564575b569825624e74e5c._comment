OP here,

1.) First of all, **I** have not made any \"previous posts of this nature\", etc; the post that begins this thead is the first such post \"of this nature\" regarding checksums that I have made to this forum.

You both have obviously wrongly *assumed* that I am one or more other individuals. 

This is something I've noticed quite a bit of here lately: people finding certain similiarities between different posts scattered throughout the forum and then not only *presuming* but actually *asserting* (and rather boldly at that) that said posts must all be from the same author. This despite the fact that nearly all of the posts here are made under the same \"Anonymous\" handle.

So you can kindly keep your condescension and presumptiveness to yourself, thank you very much.

2.) Next, contrary to your indignant insinuations and accusations, I never stated or even *implied* that *anything* could be a *substitute* for properly verifying a digital signature, much less checksums posted by random anons to a forum such as this. 

(It would seem that appreciating *nuance*, *subtelties*, \"shades of *grey*\", etc., is not one of your respective strong suits.)

3.) Regarding your assertions that checksums (cryptographic hashes) for the ISOs have absolutely *no* value or usefullness whatsoever, I would point-out that none other than the TAILS devs themselves obviously do not agree: On the very page that \"comment #1\" linked-to, the **official TAILS instructions** for verifying the download, one finds the **sha256 checksum** for the ISO of the latest (final) release of TAILS. (see further down below for more on this)

4.) Regarding \"comment 1\"s  disputation of my specific statement,

>(If a consensus is built and someone finds their sums differing from the consensus, then it would be cause for concern)

I must say that I seriously doubt that you actually believe that this would not be the case.

To illustrate and clarify what I meant:

Let's say there were to be even as little as two or three separate posts that all report the same checksum for a given ISO. And someone else finds that the checksum he gets for(what appears to be and what he believed to be) the same ISO doesn't match said consensus of the posts in the forum. I think it is pretty obvivous that the odds of the person with the *differing* checksum being the one to have downloaded a forged or corrupted file are pretty high. And I think you realize this as well.

Yes, SSL is vulnerable. But what are the **odds**, *realistically*, of the boum.org domain (or almost any other known, reputable site), at any given time having their SSL successfully breached-- successfully enough to get past users phishing-savvy enough to visually check the URL that appears in the browser location bar? 

Now granted, manipulating and altering this *forum* is probably much easier than successfully pulling-off the likes of a MITM attack on it  (*OP*s can be edited extremely easily by *anyone* but it does not seem nearly as easy for anyone other than a site admin to alter any of the *replies* made in any thread).

But still, would you really argue that if there were a consensus of at least *several* posts all reporting matching checksums, that the odds wouldn't be relatively low that *all* such posts were forgeries, etc.?  

Isn't some *perspective*, regarding *odds* and *probability*, in order here?

Let me reiterate and again emphasize that all of what I described above would only be as a *supplemental*/*additional*/*adjunct* method; absolutely **NOT** as a *substitute* for properly verifying PGP signatures. Or as a method of *last resort* or even just laziness that some users may inevitably *choose* to undertake *with the awareness of its inherent weaknesess, limitations and resulting risks*. 

Again, on the very page that \"comment #2\" linked-to\" (as I cited above), in introducing the instructions for _verifying the **sha256 checksum**_, we find the following statement,

>Instead of a cryptographic signature, this technique uses a cryptographic hash. We propose it because it's especially easy for Windows users.

5.)
> Learn to use PGP and/or RTFM

You imply that properly verifying a PGP signature offers offers *100%* reliability; is *fail-proof*/ \"watertight\", etc., yet the page in the official documentation entitled, 'Trusting the TAILS signing key' at 
`https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html`
, *linked-to on the very page that you link under the header RTFM, begins with the statement,

>We will present you three techniques from the easiest to the safest. Again, **none of them is** a **perfect** and magic solution.
