Also, for those who *manually* install TAILS to USB and wish to check the integrity of the \"burn\", the PGP signature cannot be used for this. The only way I know of is to generate a cryptographic hash of the ISO *after running isohybrid on it*, and then check that hash against the one you get for the partition containing the installed TAILS-- as detailed here:
