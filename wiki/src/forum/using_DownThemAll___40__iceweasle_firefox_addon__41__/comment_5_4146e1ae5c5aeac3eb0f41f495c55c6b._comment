you could try to use unplug:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/unplug/
it actually uses DownThemAll. I corresponded with the autor a long time ago to ask if it was Tor safe or not to use with the Tor browserbundle.
It is in part. He used wireshark to see it worked but unplug has two download methods one is a cog and other is get file i think...it was a long time ago..
Anyway the cog runs rtcpdump as a separate process bypassing the browser proxy settings. He told me that perhaps he was gonna have a look at it before next version in order to make it respect proxies completelly.
Anyway... such a flaw is a non-issue when in a system like tails so if you whish try it out, and if you like it i will post here more details.
