I never used DownThemAll so I can't tell you whether it is safe or not to use it. As a general rule, you should [[avoid installing additional browser plugins|doc/first_steps/persistence#browser_plugins]].

I added your suggesting to include uget as a [[ticket for us to discuss further|/todo/include_download_manager]]. This might be useful to download big files across separate working sessions.

If you want to try using uget from Tails, you could install it as an additional program and try to do the required tweaks to make it persistent. You should read the documentation on the [[persistent volume|/doc/first_steps/persistence]].

Please report back your findings.
