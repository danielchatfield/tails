yeah, i would like to have a download manager that grabs videos from youtube and similar sites if possible unless it compromises anonymity. what i want to be able to do is grab info from the web like youtube vids and printing out web pages in PDF form and then offload to flash media drive without all the tracking crooks following me everywhere and building profile on me.
