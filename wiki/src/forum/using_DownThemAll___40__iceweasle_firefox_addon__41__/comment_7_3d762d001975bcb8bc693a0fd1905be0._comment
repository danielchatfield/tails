* Uget should be added. It is a graphical download manager, included within the Debian repositories, previously recommended on this forum, with an optional command line interface. Both interfaces support using proxies and would work well with tor/tails:

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/urlget/

* youtube-dl works with a proxy for downloading videos from YouTube, if I remember correctly it is command line only:

http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/

* clive works with a proxy for downloading videos from YouTube, if I remember correctly it is also command line only:

http://clive.sourceforge.net/

As others have recommended, please don't add additional add-ons to Firefox. The three applications posted about here require you to configure the programs to use a proxy they don't use a proxy by default!

Uget is my #1 choice.
