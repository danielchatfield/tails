And how do you expect to help the people who DON'T speak english?
This is a forum, people post questions and other people try to answer them. A person doesn't speak english, so he writes in his own language. I KNOW the answer and I KNOW the language... How could I in good conscience not answer him????? -.^ That goes like the Richard Stallman theory ''You can make lots of money but you can't help your neighboor''. Free software exists so one can help his neighboor. GNU/Linux came from there, so did TAILS... Sorry, but the only thing I can say is I HAD TO HELP HIM, AND I WILL HELP AGAIN IF HE ASKS! Don't like it? Delete the posts in non-english languages. But that would turn this place into a censored and under-surveillance website... like as if we lived in China... TAILS is the tool AGAINST that. So, you can't really do that without damaging the whole purpose of this website and this OS.

Enough said, Anyone who needs help in portuguese or english language just ask, I will help.
