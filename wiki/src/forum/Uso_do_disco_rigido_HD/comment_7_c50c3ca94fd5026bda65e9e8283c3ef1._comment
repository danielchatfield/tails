> And how do you expect to help the people who DON'T speak english?

I don't think we want to take responsibility for hosting
anonymously published content that most of the Tails team can't
understand. So I have no good answer to your question right now.

We decided to provide a way to do user support on the
web (through this forum currently, through other ways hopefully
soon) in English. That's our contribution. It does not magically
extends to any other need.

Things would probably be different if, for a given language L,
there was some trust building process with a team of speakers of
this language, that we could at some point trust to maintain
a sub-forum in this language. Unfortunately, I don't see this
happen yet. I very much hope that the question & answer website
that will replace this forum allows such a trust building process
to happen, and even encourages it. It would be awesome if this
happened for the Portuguese language, and you were part of this
story! :)

> I WILL HELP AGAIN IF HE ASKS!

I do empathize with this, and I guess I would have a hard time
acting differently than you did, but still: it's not enough to
make it me happy to host random content I can't understand.

> Don't like it? Delete the posts in non-english languages.

I think that's exactly what I will do until we have better
possibilities. Sorry, I know this sucks. Let's create these
better possibilities to make it suck less.

> But that would turn this place into a censored and under-surveillance website... like as if we lived in China... TAILS is the tool AGAINST that. So, you can't really do that without damaging the whole purpose of this website and this OS.

Wow. I believe you're mistaken about the [[goals of
Tails|contribute/design]], as the Tails project is not about
hosting a 100%-free-speech multilingual forum. Don't like it?
Host one yourself :)
