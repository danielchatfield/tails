>Enough said, Anyone who needs help in portuguese or english language just ask, I will help.

First, I am not working for Tails.

Second, I just hope that your answer(s) is/are correct.

I have a better suggestion.

The next time a post appears in a language other than English and you are able to translate it, please translate it into English in your reply. This is for the benefit of all the other readers of the forum.

It will also allow Tails to verify if your reply is correct.
