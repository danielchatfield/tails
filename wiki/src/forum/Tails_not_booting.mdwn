I am using a Toshiba Portege R100 which can not boot from USB or CD, but can boot from PCMCIA. So I boot with grub4dos from a CF card in a PCMCIA adapter. Works OK with mini Linux and many others, but not with Tails 0.7.2. 
I get the error:
 Unable to find a medium containing a live file system.
The relevant menu.lst I use is:

title tails
map (hd0,3)/tails.iso (hd32)
map --hook
chainloader (hd32)

I get past the debian splash screen with the language choices, and then the boot fails with the above error.
I assume my menu.lst entry is wrong, or I should use an extract of the ISO file (in a separate folder?).
Anyone can suggest a solution?
