Ok, so I'll ask you some more questions:

- Did this laptop ever boot on another USB stick? Ubuntu installation, other live system?
- What is the exact error message: \"boot failure\" with nothing else on the screen?
- What model of DELL laptop is it?
- Did you manage to show the boot menu by pressing key F12 when the laptop is displaying its first POST screem? Then what happen?
