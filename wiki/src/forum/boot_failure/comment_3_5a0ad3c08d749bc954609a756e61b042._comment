The \"boot failure\" message appears at the very beginning of the boot sequence, before any tails-related screens appear.  It's as if the media on the stick is not recognized by my computer.  The same stick successfully boots Tails on a different computer.  My computer is a Dell running XP. Any help will be appreciated.
