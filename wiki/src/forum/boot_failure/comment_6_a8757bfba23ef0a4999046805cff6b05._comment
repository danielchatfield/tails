Ok, so I'll ask you some more questions:

    Did this laptop ever boot on another USB stick? Ubuntu installation, other live system?

No, I never previously attempted to boot any \"live\" os on the laptop.

    What is the exact error message: \"boot failure\" with nothing else on the screen?

Yes, the words \"boot failure\" appear at the top of the otherwise blank black screen.  Nothing else appears on the screen, and nothing changes on the screen once the boot failure message is shown, which happens immediately after the bios loads.

    What model of DELL laptop is it?

This is actually a Dell desktop.  I see no model name or  number, just \"Dell\".

    Did you manage to show the boot menu by pressing key F12 when the laptop is displaying its first POST screem? Then what happen?

Yes, I hit F12 and enter the boot sequence screen - I choose USB Zip, and then pretty much immediately get the boot failure message.

Tom
