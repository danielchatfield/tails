>Tantrum or effort to retrospectively introduce some \"hacking\"?

Will you ever read it? Are you capable of understanding it?

You seem to be having some difficulty comprehending what you read and your posts are making less and less sense. Do you feel well? I'm becoming concerned that you may be suffering a stroke.

Re read this thread. The information of which you profess to be unaware has all been typed out for you. This is simply the way things have been done. New to you != new. Isn't your curious insistence that it doesn't work somewhat contradicted by reality? The Tails website exists despite your protestations that it's all wrong. Furthermore, and this will clearly astound you, this site is neither the first nor the only collaborative website in existence! There's even a name for them! Sites managed such as this one are often known as \"wikis\", a word derived from wiki - the Hawaiian word for \"quick and dirty collaborative website\". I understand that there might even exist larger collaborative website experiments! You should really try to search out one of those, familiarise your self with how it (doesn't) work(s), then explain to its operators the error of their ways. I'm sure they'd love to hear from you. You also seem to be intent on incessantly demonstrating your profound ignorance of the workings of Git. You needn't. You've made it patently obvious. There's a pertinent link among the numerous references which have been provided for you. Perhaps you might quietly educate yourself rather than raucously reiterating your ignorance?
