>Watch out kiddies, if you express your concern about how things get hacked every time you express your concern, the developers will loose all sense of up and down and we will all suffer horrible deaths.

No. *Nothing* is being \"hacked. What it actually explained, as you'd have realised if you were capable, it that *all* the **edits** to this site are managed by a (rather good) system called Git. Yes, anyone can edit anything and, as already explained, repeatedly, to you, every one of those edits is then reviewed and, if necessary, reverted. This presents a minor annoyance which has been identified for improvement. Is it really necessary to re-type exactly the same info over and over again? Will you ever read it? Are you capable of understanding it?

>Oh I didn't realise that the developers time could be so easily \"diverted\". Perhaps we need a forum topic on how the developers should MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND .

*Minds*. No, of course you haven't. You don't seem to have realised anything at all. You don't even seem to have stopped for a moment to pull your head out of your arse.

Read [this](https://tails.boum.org/forum/WHERE_IS_0.13__63____33__/#comment-fa1300a798921ffbfbfcb4ff98fe451f) then.

>oh yeah thats rite, I cant do that because everything I write gets hacked after I post it

*Right*. Wrong, read some of the information which has had to be spoon fed to you as you're incapable of finding it for yourself.

>We got a bloody geneous here! follow the golden link back to the beginning of this subject and find a marvelous CONTRIBUTION

*Genius*?
