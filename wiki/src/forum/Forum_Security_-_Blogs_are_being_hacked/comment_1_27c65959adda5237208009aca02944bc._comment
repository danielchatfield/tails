#\"EDIT\"

I find the 'edit link' at all pages of the site.


However to edit the pages the user has to be authenticated whereas the TODO, News, Forum, Documentation **The User Has OPEN Access**

The page **<https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.13-rc1/>** is again open.
The URL of the downloads can be modified there.

Atleast Lock Down pages which contain important links like your pgp keys, torrent links, etc.
