don't be rediculous

\**ridiculous*

>Note that the whole system is managed with Git. Probably one of the most competent and secure collaborative development frameworks there is.

Everyone but you understands that.

>nothing has been changed

Do try to comprehend the simple facts placed before you. You have made twelve trivial commits to Git, all messing with other peoples punctuation. Links to the first nine have been provided for your edification. All twelve will now have to be reviewed. This we explained to you in comment 3. As was, **IMPORTANTLY** *none of this has presented much of a problem (although you appear to be trying to make it one) but nevertheless the whole system is earmarked for replacement*.

Please try to get your head around the simple facts which have been explained to you and stop being such an irritating little wanker.
