>You avoided adding a “contribute” link to your stupid “devs are never at fault” rant. That's a progress!

Don't speak so fast....

>If you don't like the way the forum works now, why not improve it?

There it is. lol. 

I think that TAILS are quite embarrassed about their poor selection in choosing to use this Forum. They also recognise to put a warning about about such major shortcomings like being able to change the subject, would draw attention to the mistake. So instead of informing everyone that there is a problem, they draw attention away from it by posting rubbish here there and everywhere. They do everything other than actually say anything signed by TAILS because they know that they would sound retarded supporting such a stupid system

Lets face the facts, the guy who has been the dev. supporter this whole forum is none other than TAILS itself.

You wont see any comment from TAILS, they are perfectly happy to allow people to be confused if it hides their stupidity
