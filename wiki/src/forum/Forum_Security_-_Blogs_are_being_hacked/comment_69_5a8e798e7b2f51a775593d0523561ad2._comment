>The intact initial post would surely leave the reader in no confusion about the origin of the thread? It referrers to the same \"hacking\" as the title. Perhaps some explanatory disclaimer should be added to the top of the post too? Something to set the tone and warn new readers. As was done on the other thread

Yes this is a good idea. Leave the post as is, there is no need to delete the original subject.   just add a note with explanation. 

Perhaps its reasonable that the author considered the edit's hacking and others might have made this mistake too. 

As was pointed out there is another subject just like this 

<https://tails.boum.org/forum/Is_Tails_Making_Me_Too_Paranoid__63__/>

This person became so fearful that he/she thought the whole of TAILS was compromised and needed to alert everyone.

Sadly the original subject was changed to make it sound like they were being paranoid. 

I think it would have been much better to have left the original title so that everyone could see how the mistake was made. unfortunately because it was changed it happened again and this whole forum appeared 

How much alarm needs to be raised before a simple warning is posted to solve the whole problem

Perhaps a better thing to do is to stop the problem in the first place.  

Forum visitors deserve to be informed that changes can be made to the subject they are writing about , without their consent. This way we would not have to 'correct' people who have legitimate fears.

When most people write someone, they expect it to stay the way they wrote it. Of course it is going to alarm them when things suddenly appear to change or disappear
