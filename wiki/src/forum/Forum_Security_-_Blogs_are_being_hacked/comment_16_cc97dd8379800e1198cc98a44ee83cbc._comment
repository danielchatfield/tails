>i'm still at a loss as to what i'm suppose to understand

*Supposed*. The website is editable and managed with Git. This is widely known and published information. It is not necessarily the best way to manage things and replacement is intended. Links to those plans have already been offered to you. Pissing about with the website isn't the most important thing on the todo list and the developers' precious time can be better spent elsewhere. Making a fuss about a well understood minor irritation is of no use to anyone. In fact, this entire thread serves no useful purpose whatsoever. Is that clear enough? It must be at least the fourth or fifth time it's been explained.

You seem to be having some difficulty comprehending what you read and your posts are making less and less sense. Do you feel well? I'm becoming concerned that you may be suffering a stroke.

Is there someone nearby who knows you well? If so, could you find them and ask them \"do I seem normal?\"
