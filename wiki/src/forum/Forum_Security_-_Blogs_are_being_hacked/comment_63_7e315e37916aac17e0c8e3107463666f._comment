>So please people, take a breath, and don't feel responsible to answer many times to posts where the discussion seems impossible.

I think the recent posts have been by himself. Possibly attempting to bury [commit 7180e96caf7d13ec70fc00c9d0cec4774da062f1](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=commitdiff;h=7180e96caf7d13ec70fc00c9d0cec4774da062f1).

In a wider context however, I wish we'd thought of that sooner. ;o)

Thanks for the appearance.
