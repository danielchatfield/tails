>It is clear that you don't understand what git is about.

Gosh.

>Having version control does not imply that anyone has write access.

Oh good, you've read something, at last.

No one has suggested that \"having version control implies that anyone has write access\". What *has* been suggested to you (repeatedly) is that \"having version control\"... one has control of versions! With a secure and sophisticated \"version control\" system such as Git running as the site's back-end, this site \"has version control\". So, just as any other open and collaborative project, this site *can* be developed openly. The sophisticated *version control* system, called Git, makes this *possible*! 

>Having a site in wiki format does not mean that everyone should have write access to everything.

No one has suggested that \"having a site in wiki format means that everyone *should* have write access to *everything*\". What *was* (repeatedly) suggested to you ([with](https://tails.boum.org/todo/split_Git/) [several](https://tails.boum.org/todo/improve_the_forum/) [references](https://tails.boum.org/todo/locking_down_this_website/)) is that such a site *can* have a generally open and collaborative structure. As indeed this one does. As indeed this one *is known to have*. As indeed do many others.

It's *clear* what's happened here. You got all excited about your \"discovery\". You quickly became *so over excited* that you ignored

gracious *[pleas](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-0c82c3708f7fe8d0a6715889c88ab6cf)*
for [reason.](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-91cc1dfdc5d155bac51af75685616c12)

*Eventually*, [someone got through!](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-776290a3b5518fb08f1ea07f110560c7)

Then, the moment the penny finally dropped, rather than quietly reading about the technology, or skulking off in anonymous embarassment, or (and this'll tickle you) *thanking* them for kindly explaining things to you, you flew into some sort of [psychotic tantrum](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-404d887d38c771d491b8019add384696). Smooth.

This whole thread is most unfortunate. I'm sorry your great discovery turned out not to be. I'm sorry that you were [led-on](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-2f13e973b772d654dd23b911afcbb8e3) by a well meaning but ignorant third party. I'm sorry that you [failed to comprehend](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-c388a2c64c98f30faf7d62abc46e3f2e) the other early posts. I'm sorry that you were so obviously embarrassed, shocked and disappointed when you finally did get the message. I'm sorry that the shock seems to have caused you to endure some strange and terrible [schizmatic episode](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-404d887d38c771d491b8019add384696). I'm sorry that you then felt it necessary to try to save face by [trying to pretend that you were actually objecting to imaginary \"censorship\"](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-a3b464602f009409e52be48542053004). I'm sorry that you got yourself so freaked out and worked up that you appear to have [had a stroke](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-6e5432cbf5557d4e477ddd8c53d7beaa). I'm sorry you're so petty and pathetic that you now feel compelled to try to \"save face\" once more by pretending that you were \"right\" all along and evree1 els iz wey stoopider. This is all horrible. I'm sorry that you've subjected yourself to this protracted ordeal and hope you feel better soon. Let's just call it a day, eh?

I shall not be replying to this again. I see no good coming of this and fear I've been \"feeding the troll\". Oops!

Please, by all means continue use this thread yourself for as long as you like. Should you feel the need.
