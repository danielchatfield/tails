That's not \"a problem\" it's the point! The current title is alarmist, incorrect and damaging. It should not be read! It should be replaced with something not alarmist, not damaging, correct, and appropriate for *this* thread.

Or do you suggest there'll suddenly be a stampede of people who don't understand wikis all reposting this thread? This has *never* happened before. What makes *you* think that *you* might suddenly see this? ;)

Is it? Not to me. The former title was inappropriate, the new one is appropriate. That strikes me as a success.

>This is for the simple reason that there is no requirement to read every single subject in the forum before posting a new one.

This thread would continue to make as much (or little) sense as it does now. Just as is the case with the other thread.

>This is especially true when you read a previous title which states to be about \"Tails making you paranoid\"

It wasn't true before so it isn't \"especially true now\" however, no-one has suggested the new title for *this* thread should mention paranoia... although... it would certainly be fitting.

>I don't see how \"tails making you paranoid\" is a warning for \"Your subject may change without notice\"

You're talking about two different threads now. Why should the title of one thread be \"a warning for\" the content of a different thread?
