NO! Please don't! Please don't spam the devs. They'll only have to take time off from whatever they're doing to tell you \"yes, yes, we're aware of how the website works and are working on a replacement\" and perhaps provide you with some of the links which YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN GIVEN IN THIS THREAD. Leave them get on with useful thing - like *developing*! PLEASE refer to [comment 3](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-91cc1dfdc5d155bac51af75685616c12)!
