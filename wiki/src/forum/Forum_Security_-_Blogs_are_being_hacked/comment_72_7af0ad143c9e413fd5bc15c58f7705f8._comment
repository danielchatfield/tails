>All the more reason for a change of title and explanation then! ;-)

Change the title or not at your whim, just make sure you state that the title has been \"edited for accuracy\" and  place a link to those who want to read what it has been changed from, avoiding confusion. 

The problem is this,

A lot of well meaning people who start subjects  in the future are not going to read your \"changed title\". It will stay on this page like the ones mentioned in comment 70

In fact, its apparent that a changed title in 

<https://tails.boum.org/forum/Is_Tails_Making_Me_Too_Paranoid__63__/> 

didn't help at all. 

This is for the simple reason that there is no requirement to read every single subject in the forum before posting a new one.

 This is especially true when you read a previous title which states to be about \"Tails making you paranoid\"

I don't see how \"tails making you paranoid\" is a warning for \"Your subject may change without notice\"
