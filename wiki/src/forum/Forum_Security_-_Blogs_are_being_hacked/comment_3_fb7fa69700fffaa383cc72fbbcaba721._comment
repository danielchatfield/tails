All that this messing about is achieving is spamming git with **crap** which some poor soul with better things to do will now have to check through. Not a huge or immensely time-consuming task but a pointless waste nonetheless.

Have you \"discovered\" the *Recent Changes* page yet? It's presents a simple summary of the most recent commits to the website.

None of this has presented much of a problem (although you appear to be trying to make it one) but nevertheless the whole system is earmarked for replacement. The most likely candidate appearing to be OSQA at the moment.

If you persist in making this deficiency a problem then all you'll achieve is moving messing with the forum up the developers list of priorities thereby diverting them from **USEFUL THINGS**

If you're trying to help then why not [contribute?](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/index.en.html) If you follow that link you'll find a whole section explaining the current plans and work which needs to be done to the website/forum.
