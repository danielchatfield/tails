>Perhaps the developers would consider changing the title of this thread to something less contentious

I think its the goal of the thread to educate people about how the subject is right or wrong or needs changing. As the reader moves down the subject hopefully they will agree with you. To change the beginning to reflect whats decided at the end will cause much confusion when the bulk of the comments refer to the original tite. You would have to go through each comment and adjust it accordingly. How would people be able to express themselves if every comment is constantly changed like that? There is no chance anyone could follow this thread as it is let alone comprehend modifications like that

Any adjustment would have to be done before any comments are made

Perhaps we can work on how responses can be made constructively so that at the end the reader is able to understand and not be alarmed 

I find it surprising that the moderator didn't just state the facts when they commented in 62. It doesn't sound like tails was too alarmed
