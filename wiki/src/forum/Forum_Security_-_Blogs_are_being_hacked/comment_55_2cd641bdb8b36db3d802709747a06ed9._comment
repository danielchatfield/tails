No. Nothing is being \"hacked. What it actually explained, as you'd have realised if you were capable, it that all the edits to this site are managed by a (rather good) system called Git. Yes, anyone can edit anything and, as already explained, repeatedly, to you, every one of those edits is then reviewed and, if necessary, reverted. This presents a minor annoyance which has been identified for improvement.
