Come on people does it matter what particular incident the author might have been referring to? It has been established right from post number **ONE** that anyone can change the subject after it was posted even if they are not authenticated. 

I can see now why it took 200 years for mankind to agree that the planet was not flat and we would all fall of!

After 34 posts  we can all see what the problem is. 

Aye lets put a warning up, jeez. How about this to get us started

\"Please be aware that the forum  which you all can't resole after 34 posts may be even more difficult because the SUBJECT may have changed half way through\"

ARE WE ALL CLEAR ON WHAT THE PROBLEM IS!!!!!!!

how about we concentrate on how to implement a solution before every man AND his dog decide how rediculous we all are
