>I think that TAILS are quite embarrassed about their poor selection in choosing to use this Forum.

No you don't, You're just saying it. Please learn to differentiate between things you believe and things you say. The two are so obviously distinct.

>They also recognise to put a warning about about such major shortcomings like being able to change the subject, would draw attention to the mistake. So instead of informing everyone that there is a problem, they draw attention away from it by posting rubbish here there and everywhere.

No one has said there isn't a problem. It was even explained to you in [comment 3](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-91cc1dfdc5d155bac51af75685616c12)

>They do everything other than actually say anything signed by TAILS because they know that they would sound retarded supporting such a stupid system

Irony, fallacy and irony again! All in one... sentence? Very... impressive?

>Lets face the facts, the guy who has been the dev. supporter this whole forum is none other than TAILS itself.

That wouldn't be an infantile attempt to bait a developer perchance? OMG! You're so sophisticated! You should address The Oxford Union.

>You wont see any comment from TAILS, they are perfectly happy to allow people to be confused if it hides their stupidity

The stupidity on display here is neither hidden nor Tails'
