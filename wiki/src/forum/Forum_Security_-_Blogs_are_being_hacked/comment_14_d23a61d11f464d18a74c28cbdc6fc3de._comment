>What it actually explained, as you'd have realised if you were capable, it that all the edits to this site are managed by a (rather good) system called Git

Yes if only I were capable I would write as if this idiotic censorship (often called moderating in forums) is a \"rather jolly git feature\"

>No. Nothing is being \"hacked\"...Yes, anyone can edit anything and, as already explained, repeatedly, to you, 

well I don't much care if you call it \"hacked\" or \"edited\".  Whats the difference?

>every one of those edits is then reviewed and, if necessary, reverted

Umm if the author wanted their blog edited, reviewed and if necessary reverted, they would have done it before they posted the thing. Seems to make ummm sense to me. 

Lets not confuse moderated edited reviewed  whatever you want to call it for anything than altering the original intended message 

> This presents a minor annoyance which has been identified for improvement

having the subject of a discussion altered by third parties is not minor, its fundamental

>. Is it really necessary to re-type exactly the same info over and over again? Will you ever read it? Are you capable of understanding it?


I do believe I am capable of understanding if things are put clearly. If your going to say someone is not understanding, please put exactly what is not understood after the comment, otherwise you will simply confuse everyone. 


>Minds. 

Yes thank you kindly for correcting grammar, I'm sure this improves everyone's understanding of the discussion

>No, of course you haven't. You don't seem to have realised anything at all. 

Umm you just asked and answered your own question, I don't need to be here. lol. Even with your grammatical correction, i'm still at a loss as to what i'm suppose to understand. less grammar more just write a bit clearer please

> You don't even seem to have stopped for a moment to pull your head out of your arse.

You best give  some more pointers to how one is able to \"pull one's head out\"  and why it was there in the first place. Is this about something you wrote earlier? 

>Read this then.

I read it. Now that instruction is precise, were getting somewhere

>Right. Wrong, read some of the information which has had to be spoon fed to you as you're incapable of finding it for yourself.

please please please, what am I spooning and suppose to find for myself? I thought I was suppose to read that link of five pages long, 

>We got a bloody geneous here! follow the golden link back to the beginning of this subject and find a marvelous CONTRIBUTION

Genius?


I think I understand this question. You think I meant Genius. Well umm no I thought geneous spelt it pretty accurately
