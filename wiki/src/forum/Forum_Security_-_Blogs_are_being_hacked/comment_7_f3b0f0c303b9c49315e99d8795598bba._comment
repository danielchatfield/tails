**Please...**

* Note that the second comment was made by an observer ignorant of the situation.

* Read the third comment.

* Note that the whole system is managed with [Git](http://git-scm.com/). Probably one of the most competent and secure collaborative development frameworks there is.

* Realise that *all* this is already known and understood (see next point).

* Read [this](https://tails.boum.org/todo/split_Git/), [this](https://tails.boum.org/todo/improve_the_forum/) and [this](https://tails.boum.org/todo/locking_down_this_website/).

Your interest and time are welcome and greatly appreciated but finite resources, please don't squander them!
