>You really suggest that someone typing \"aye\" three times into a thread of 40 posts suddenly makes him \"the people\" and correct?

Who said anything about being correct. please be more accurate when commenting about other posts. 

>Do you also still believe that \"Tails\" are oblivious to this thread, even though the working of this site have been explained to you (with links) over and over again? There's no way the developers are oblivious to this and I'm sure they've looking on in dismay since the beginning.

Are you tails? If you are then why havent you signed it? If not then please provide supporting evidence. 

>Isn't that precisely the point? The whole history of this site is recorded in Git. Someone has clearly gone to a great deal trouble searching through the forum for evidence of the rife \"hacking\" you imply. They appear to have found a single relevant reversion!

Well if you or someone thinks its relevant then please explain when you post, otherwise why did you mention it. 

>Rather ranting on and on \"this site is being hacked\" \"yes it is\" \"aye\" \"aye\" \"aye\" ad infinitum, perhaps you'd provide the relevant links to the particular events which you protest so strongly about? Or do they not exist?

Aye aye aye are people who agree, please outline what is wrong with this before making a statement. Yes I'm sure the person who wrote the title has an event, but for everyone else their reasons have been outlined and you should once again please provide something new to refute that or move on

>If \"Blogs are being hacked\" you can prove that \"Blogs are being hacked\". All the \"hackings\" will have been recorded! Please find some of them in Git and provide the proof!

proof that hacking is easy to do is provided in blog one as mentioned. It has been said in relation to this demand for proof before, please ask a new question, it has been answered already

Seems someone is content to simply say the same thing over and over. no secret to why this subject is going on and on
