Its not changing the title of this thread which is an issue. 

yes its a reposting (rehashing the same problem) which is of concern. ie that there will still be confusion about why subjects are edited. 

This problem was first identified in this post

<https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Design___38___Functionality:_Primitive__44___Awkward/>
 
<It appears as if anyone can remove any post (even those of other's)
I just tested this by adding a paragraph in brackets at the end of the original post at https://tails.boum.org/forum/openvpn_support/
Presumably, this is the same for removing posts as well, but for obvious reasons, I did not test that.>

<he rest of your proposals are gathered on a new todo list item I just created. See, improve the forum.>

There have been comments posted in our current discussion to the effect that this is not a big problem, that  the forum is due to be upgraded ect ect. 

>None of this has presented much of a problem... nevertheless the whole system is earmarked for replacement



That thread was posted by TAILS on

It occurs to me that a warning could have been posted about this issue **fifteen months ago.** 

<https://tails.boum.org/forum/New_Replies_on_this_forum___63__/#comment-562092caf37b6b7c322b0c6611868bb8>

that post was made on 

Tue 03 Apr 2012 03:36:23 PM CEST

and the mentioned tails .11 was released the same month

Still think we are imminent on getting a new forum?

<https://tails.boum.org/forum/What__39__s_up_with_the_forum__63__/>

Another post about the confusion caused by lack of authentication when editing posts. 

Then of course the one mentioned before 

<https://tails.boum.org/forum/Is_Tails_Making_Me_Too_Paranoid__63__/>

with a user so concerned about the effect that the (unnecessary) confusion has caused writing this 

>I hope you realize that this has hurt Tails' reputation and probably scared users away from our using project ever again.

This post was considered so damaging to TAILS that the subject had to be changed 
to stop the panic.

Then we have the current page which we are noe reading. We are  up to comment 74! 

Once again it has been said over and over that the opening subject is so damaging it has to be replaced. 

>Or do you suggest there'll suddenly be a stampede of people who don't understand wikis all reposting this thread?  What makes you think that you might suddenly see this? ;)

>This has never happened before.

Well unfortunately I think I will have to disagree with you on this one 
There is more than enough evidence to prove that statement wrong and to  merit a warning

In fact there was more than enough evidence produced by comment 30 where a solution was even proposed and voted on

< https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-06bf6f98a8f0d9320cb5f9759f424dfd>

I have yet to see any comment made since that post which provides any sound reason why a warning should not be posted.
