>If you persist in making this deficiency a problem then all you'll achieve is moving messing with the forum up the developers list of priorities thereby diverting them from USEFUL THINGS

Watch out kiddies, if you express your concern about how things get hacked every time you express your concern, the developers will loose all sense of up and down and we will all suffer horrible deaths. 

Oh I didn't realise that the developers time could be so easily \"diverted\". Perhaps we need a forum topic on how the developers should MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND .

oh yeah thats rite, I cant do that because everything I write gets hacked after I post it
