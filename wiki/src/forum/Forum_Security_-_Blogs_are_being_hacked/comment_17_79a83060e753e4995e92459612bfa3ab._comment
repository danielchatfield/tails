You can be tracked through your blogs by your insistence on grammar. Yes im the one wasting time here, right. 

>The website is editable and managed with Git. This is widely known and published information. It is not necessarily the best way to manage things and replacement is intended. Links to those plans have already been offered to you. Pissing about with the website isn't the most important thing on the todo list and the developers' precious time can be better spent elsewhere

I think this is a reiteration of what has already been said. I would suggest you stop raising points if you haven't anything new to say. I am humouring you for the sake of the discussion, but I think you should move on

>Making a fuss about a well understood minor irritation is of no use to anyone. In fact, this entire thread serves no useful purpose whatsoever. Is that clear enough? It must be at least the fourth or fifth time it's been explained

Yes you have said that before, whats new snoo?

>You seem to be having some difficulty comprehending what you read and your posts are making less and less sense. Do you feel well? I'm becoming concerned that you may be suffering a stroke.

yeah your right, feels like a stroke to me
