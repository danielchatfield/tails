I agree that the title needs to be changed. The sensationalist title caught my eye but the rest of the thread doesn't live up to the billing!

>To change the beginning to reflect whats decided at the end will cause much confusion when the bulk of the comments refer to the original tite.

Isn't the suggestion to change only the title - to better match the facts and attract less attention? How can that be confusing? I'm not sure any consensus was ever reached anyway!

The intact initial post would surely leave the reader in no confusion about the origin of the thread? It referrers to the same \"hacking\" as the title. Perhaps some explanatory disclaimer should be added to the top of the post too? Something to set the tone and warn new readers. As was done on the other thread.

Did you examine that other thread previous poster? Were you confused by its title?
