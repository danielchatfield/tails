Before writing long pointless rants, you should make sure that you are talking to the person who you think you are talking to. I am just a side observer who noticed a pretentious kid (you) boasting some trivial knowledge about the most recent distributed version conrol system, and making nonsensical claims on the base of that.

Ability to revert changes, based on whatever backend is installed, is unrelated to a problem with access permissions. Moreover, a problem with access permissions is still a problem, regardless of how many todo's, bugs and wishlists it is listed in.

Try to understand what you are talking about next time.
