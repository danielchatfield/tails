>Not \"hacking\", \"collaborating\"
Tails has always been a community project. It is the product of a process known as collaboration. The fundamental principle of \"collaboration\" is that the more people who contribute, the greater will be the effect. This concept is equally applicable to every aspect of the project: code, ideas, documentation, bug reporting, translation, etc. The website is openly editable to anyone. The community has been trusted to use this wisely and, in general, has done so. However all edits are tracked and managed in a system called Git and are reviewed and sometimes undone.

Again, am I really to believe that this is suppose to be a feature? 

> Being open like this, anyone has been able to contribute ideas, documentation, translations, and all the other good stuff that those who bother to read the site can find there

How is everyone able to contribute to ideas when they get changed every time TAILS doesn't lke it. Oh yes your free, just don't go across the wall to west berlin or we will shoot you. rattta tat tat. now you enjoy  free to die western scumm. 

>This has been good. It has resulted in the Tails we have today

Vodka all freedom is need da!

>The more untenable (and, frankly, lunatic) you (and others like you) make this concept appear, the more closed Tails will become.

The more you try to go over wall, stupid western lunatic, the more free we make you with bullet da!

>It will therefore become more difficult to contribute and less of a \"community\". This will be bad for Tails. It is saddening. Well done you.

Wen lunatic go over wall we spend more money on bullets and less on vodka, werry werry bad for you capitalist dog. now your family sad no vodka, well done those who stupid want go and actually eat every day. pffft, scum how dare they
