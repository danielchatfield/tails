>>Or do you suggest there'll suddenly be a stampede of people who don't understand wikis all reposting this thread? What makes you think that you might suddenly see this? ;)

>>This has never happened before.

>Well unfortunately I think I will have to disagree with you on this one 

Don't disagree with me, *prove* me wrong! Please? Pretty please with sugar on top? Oh, go on, I can tell you want to :-) PPPPPLLLLLEEEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSSSEEEEEE?????

>There is more than enough evidence to prove that statement wrong and to merit a warning

Clearly you're sitting on a *HUGE* heap of evidence... why won't you share it with me? :-(

Don't keep it all to yourself. You meany. If you can't use Git then perhaps search the forum? There must be countless desperate cries of \"HELP! My thread has been HACKED!!! HELP ME PLEASE\". Please post some links and stop keeping them all to your self. You're so selfish. Meany meany poo face.

>In fact there was more than enough evidence produced by comment 30 where a solution was even proposed and voted on

Was there? All comment 30 looks like to me is a comical demand that Tails devs FUD their own forum!!! lmao :))

>I have yet to see any comment made since that post which provides any sound reason why a warning should not be posted.
