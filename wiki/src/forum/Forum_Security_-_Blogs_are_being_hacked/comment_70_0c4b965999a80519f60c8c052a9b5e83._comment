Consensus at last!

I think this thread should be softened a bit too. The similarity between the two threads' titles is uncanny!

>Tails Website Hacked - WARNING

>Security - Blogs are being hacked

The initial content of this thread is even more alarmist than the other one's though. The other OP had the common sense to begin his post with a disclaimer...

>WARNING TO ALL USERS OF TAILS - UNCONFIRMED

...and then quickly understood the situation. He even had the humility to offer an apology at the tenth post.

At the moment there's nothing at all in this thread to contradict the panic until the third comment and the two early calls for reason are completely ignored until comment 11 - at witch point, instead of reason, it takes a sudden turn to the surreal!

Softer title and disclaimer most definitely needed!
