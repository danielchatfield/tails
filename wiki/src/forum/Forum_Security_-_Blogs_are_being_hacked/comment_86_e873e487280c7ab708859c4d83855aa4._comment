>You avoided adding a “contribute” link to your stupid “devs are never at fault” rant. That's a progress!

Why have you chosen to present the words “devs are never at fault” as a quotation? It has neither been said nor implied.

>You wont see any comment from TAILS, they are perfectly happy to allow people to be confused if it hides their stupidity

You *did* see [a comment from Tails](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Forum_Security_-_Blogs_are_being_hacked/#comment-89eb914f144d229203e0e51585696949)!

You appear to be finding the abject failure of your baiting somewhat disappointing. Oh dear. XD
