Please calm down people.

We very much appreciate to see there is a community that is growing around Tails and people supporting our work. But we are also disappointed to see how the discussions turn into flamewar and insults. This forum isn't intended for that, and a community won't be able to exist if people talk to each others this way on the forum.

So please people, take a breath, and don't feel responsible to answer many times to posts where the discussion seems impossible.
