This thread reminds me very much of [a similar recent thread.](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Is_Tails_Making_Me_Too_Paranoid__63__/)

It was decided that as the title of that thread was factually incorrect, unnecessarily alarmist and potentially damaging, it should be changed. The title was then changed to something much more appropriate.

I feel the title of this thread has the same shortcomings. Perhaps even more so. The current title may also falsely damage the reputation of Tails and may draw new forum visitors into a worthless and somewhat unpleasant thread. This has suddenly been exacerbated, since it has now taken to jumping to the top of the forum list :(

Perhaps the developers would consider changing the title of this thread to something less contentious, which better describes the thread's content and, most importantly, is technically correct?

Possibly from its current title:

    Forum Security - Blogs are being hacked

To something along the lines of:

    Some new users misunderstand this website
