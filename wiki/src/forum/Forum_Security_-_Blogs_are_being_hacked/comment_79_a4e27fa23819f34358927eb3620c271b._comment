what a turkey, bothering the devs with this

I don't think its a big issue myself

It's just bad luck if people get confused by edited blogs. They should know how Forum's work before participating in them. Editing is a common feature, and mate, its not the dev's job to teach them 

So what if a subject gets changed half way through, its not that confusing. It will only bother those who haven't taken the time to find out which part when the subject had changed. IT WAS PROBABLY DONE TO CORRECT SOMEONE'S STUPID MISTAKE ANYWAY

**The Answer is simple, we all should motitor the recent changes list**

for example 

in this group, before i post any comment I go to the recent changes page

This can be found up the top of the page (its invisible unless your mouse it on top of it, but that will only bother those too lazy too look)

on the recent changes page it has all the goings on in the forum, it looks like this

>web 03:26:12 AM 09/25/2012
diffforum/Why has the forum stopped bumping new posts to the top?/comment 8 dcc8b33127b6d94b9d0d1c2cefcb78fc 

that entry is not actually about this subject because the list covers changes made to all pages in the forum. 

so take today's date rite, its the 25/09/2012/ There are only a hundred changes so far. Just take ten minutes of each day to read them

If you bother to ACTUALLY READ them instead of just complaining in this forum that is. 

That way you can find out at what point in the discussion the subject was changed. Then when you post you won't look like a complete dingus asking why the first post doesn't make sense. 

It just takes a LITTLE EFFORT. It's not TAILS job to do the work for you!

If you forget to check on a day, its all good. You can follow any discussion by checking the changes back to when it was first written. So take this subject for example. 

It was started on 18th September. So just follow the entries from the 18th, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 to check if the subject is still the same

 Stop pissing around on the forum and work it out for yourself
