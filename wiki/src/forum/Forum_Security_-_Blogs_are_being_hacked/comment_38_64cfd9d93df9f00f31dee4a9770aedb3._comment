You really suggest that someone typing \"aye\" three times into a thread of 40 posts suddenly makes him \"the people\" and correct?

>The decision to request a warning message be placed in the interum will be forwarded to TAILS

Do you also still believe that \"Tails\" are oblivious to this thread, even though the working of this site have been explained to you (with links) over and over again? There's no way the developers are oblivious to this and I'm sure they've looking on in dismay since the beginning.

Re: Is this the event...

Isn't that precisely the point? The *whole history* of this site is recorded in Git. Someone has clearly gone to a great deal trouble searching through the forum for evidence of the rife \"hacking\" you imply. They appear to have found a single relevant *reversion*!

Rather ranting on and on \"this site is being hacked\" \"yes it is\" \"aye\" \"aye\" \"aye\" ad infinitum, perhaps you'd provide the relevant links to the particular events which you protest so strongly about? Or do they not exist?

If \"*Blogs are being hacked*\" you can **prove** that \"*Blogs are being hacked*\". All the \"hackings\" will have been recorded! Please find *some* of them in Git and provide the proof!
