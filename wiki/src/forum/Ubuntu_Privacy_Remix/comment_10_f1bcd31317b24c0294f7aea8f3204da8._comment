@Comments 8 and 9: 

Aren't what you described *ways of verifying the DVD content after it is burned\" ?

Comment #7 was a direct response to the statement \"TAILS\" had made in \"comment 1\", 

>If you already verified the ISO you downloaded as explained in our documentation, makes little sense to verify the DVD content after it was burned.

Your posts merely reinforce and emphasize the question of how \"TAILS\" could have made such a statement.
