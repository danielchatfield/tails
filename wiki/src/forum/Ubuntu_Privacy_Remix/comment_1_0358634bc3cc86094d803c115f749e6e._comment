> Any thoughts on this dual boot other than 0.9 is oudated?

I think this part of the paragraph is not up-to-date.

If you look at their [full download page](https://www.privacy-cd.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=66&Itemid=89), you'll see that this release contains Tails 0.12.1

Be aware that this release is almost a year old, so it might be unsafe to use it. I don't know the status of this project, wether it's still actively developped or not. You might want to check that before using it.

> Can Tails re-verify the DVD once burned?

Not sure to get the advantage of doing so. A DVD is a non-writeable media, so once burned, the content can't be changed. If you already verified the ISO you downloaded as explained in our documentation, makes little sense to verify the DVD content after it was burned.
