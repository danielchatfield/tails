i have two systems side by side, i can refresh the tor browser bundle over and over and keep getting to hidden wiki, but on the tor box on the same network sitting right next to it gives a 504 error, ive tried rebooting the tails box 5-6 times with no change.

Some things I have tried:

rebooting tails
messing with clock/time/timezone
new identity
whining on IRC

So I believe I have ruled out system clock and node problems.. what other issues could cause a hidden service timeout?
