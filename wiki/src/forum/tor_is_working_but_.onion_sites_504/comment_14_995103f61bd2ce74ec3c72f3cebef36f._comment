Just experianced the same problem with no .onion sites loading (tor2web would load the same site in an adjacent tab)

I tried every site i could find an address for, nothing would work while tor2web was working fine for most

Unfortunately i can't test it now as it is working fine after restarting.

Watching my router log; i'm also noticing a number of pop3s connections to the same ip over and over. is this normal?
