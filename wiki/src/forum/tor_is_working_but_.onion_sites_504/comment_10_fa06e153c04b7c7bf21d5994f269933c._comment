Tails 0.9 sometimes doesn't even load Tor.
After connection, all previous versions would start Vidalia automatically but no longer. After I start it manually it get's half way progress and hangs failing to create a circuit. After a few reboots it sometimes starts working.. but then I can't access any .onion sites

Reverted to previous version and now works, but have to manually update tor everytime
