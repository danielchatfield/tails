thanks for the reply

.onion sites have been very unreliable and intermittant, but I have seen some return to sucess. I have tried hundreds of links and on average, they don't work. The hidden wiki has only worked about 10% of the times I've tried it to the point where it seemed that something was broken. For a while, none of the .onion sites I tried were working.

I guess it's just very unreliable or perhaps I'm not in a TOR friendly time-zone. I also tried the tor bundle and had a similar experience.

thanks
