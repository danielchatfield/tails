Try running htpdate manually after you get your internet connection:

sudo htpdate -x http://www.microsoft.com/ https://check.torproject.org/

This has fixed my 504 error 3 boots in a row now.

I had tried setting date and time by hand but that didn't work.  htpdate was apparently causing my 504 error somehow.
