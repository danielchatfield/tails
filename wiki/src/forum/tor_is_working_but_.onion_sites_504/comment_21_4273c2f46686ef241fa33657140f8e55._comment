I'm not quite understanding these issues. i'm having the same problem also (can't access the hidden wiki) I was able to before i reformated my pc.  I opened the tor browser and it loaded aurora instead of firefox. now it's loading firefox and not functioning. People say set the clock forward an hour, which i did, and i don't understand how that works because i did it to no prevail. Someone also mentioned downloading a non portable version of tor? where do i download such a version? I just got the regular tor bundle.. I dont know what this tails is either? can someone give me some hints as to what i should do to get it loading .onion sites??? 

btw, i'm posting from the tor browser (firefox) right now.
