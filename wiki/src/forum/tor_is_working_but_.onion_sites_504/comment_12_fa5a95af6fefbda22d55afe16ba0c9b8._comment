Same problem.
On a laptop, new tails won't open any .onion sites. Here is my attempt to open tormail (it works fine using tor2web or browser bundle)

As you can see it just repeats the same stalling message then 
\"504 Connect to jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion:80 failed: SOCKS error: TTL expired\"

Weird, because this CD *did* work the first time I burnt it and tried it on the laptop. Took the CD out, tried it on a different comp.. suddenly it works fine on that comp. No idea why.. here's the debug info from Vidala message:
