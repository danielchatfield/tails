>It doesn't have to be THAT expensive. This is very doable.

Yeah right. Is an annual budget of 120,000 euros for four full-time experienced IT programmers expensive? If you are sure of obtaining this sum of money, I can find expert IT programmers for you to work on improving Tor. How about that?

>And I'm sure they would disagree with it not being high on the list of needs. Maybe Tor/Tails aren't high on that list of needs to you. But to many others, they certainly are.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs refers to the fact that us human beings have basic needs such as water, food, roof over our heads, warmth, healthcare insurance to be satisfied before we can think of fighting for freedom of expression/speech, human rights, anonymity on the internet, etc. People sleeping on the streets of New York or Brussels cannot be bothered with anonymity on the internet or human rights if they are poor and hungry, don't you agree?
