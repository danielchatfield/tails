Firefox didn't need any billionaires to make it a reality. And neither does next generation Tor. It's going to have to happen, billionaires or not. If the Tor Project devs won't do it, then the users will have to take charge and make it happen. 

This is open source software we are talking about. Many, many open source software projects have happened. And the vast majority without any billionaires, either. And so could this.

We just need some highly competant volunteers (I know, but it does happen for some projects). And supplement with some really good outsourced programmers, as you already suggested. It doesn't have to be THAT expensive. This is very doable.

The Tor Project has already admitted it isn't good enough against some threats (the \"global adversary\"). And that is exactly the sort of threat that concerns many users. That is a huge problem for these users.

And I'm sure they would disagree with it not being high on the list of needs. Maybe Tor/Tails aren't high on that list of needs to you. But to many others, they certainly are.
