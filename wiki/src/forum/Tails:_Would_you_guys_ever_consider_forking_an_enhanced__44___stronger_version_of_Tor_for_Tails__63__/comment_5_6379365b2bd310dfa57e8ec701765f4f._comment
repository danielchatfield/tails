Read some [tor reports](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/). Look how much money they get from [sponsors](https://www.torproject.org/about/sponsors.html.en).

I think they are distracted with unimportant stuff. Censorship detection, metrics...

They have many full time employees. Only few are working on Tor or Torbrowser.

The reports are small for full time employees. What they do in a month they could do in a week.

No roadmap for fixing the important stuff with encryption and padding.
