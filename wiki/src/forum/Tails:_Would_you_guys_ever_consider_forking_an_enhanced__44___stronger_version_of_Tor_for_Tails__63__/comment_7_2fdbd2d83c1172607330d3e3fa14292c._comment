I welcome anyone to implement a better anonymity solution than Tor. Show me the code :)

But please, don't suggest the Tor project has not been working e.g. on stronger crypto: this has been worked on for a while, is now spec'ed out IIRC, and mostly needs some coding time. If anyone has the required skills and time, implementing this may make way more sense than forking.

Also, Tor is much more than a client. It's a protocol, a network and a community of users, developers, relay operators. While forking the code is a git clone away, building such a successful community (that's entirely needed to make the result \"stronger\") takes more time.

But, hey, if you want to fork, fork.
