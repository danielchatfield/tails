It's not possible to boot a sd card without firmware. You always need some kind of minimal firmware. Coreboot is the closest thing and its open source.

Programming firmware is so complicated, how can YOU confirm that the producer didn't include a backdoor or how MUCH are you willing to pay someone to check that there is no backdoor?

What about [CPU backdoors](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-thoughts-on-cpu-backdoors.html)?

Forget about it. There is no such thing as [trusted hardware](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2009/03/trusting-hardware.html). Not even for the military. It is a problem for military that their hardware comes from china.
