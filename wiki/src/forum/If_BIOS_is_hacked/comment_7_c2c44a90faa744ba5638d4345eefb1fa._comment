>the media TAILS is booted from is read only (RO)

Yes, but in the case of a USB stick (i.e., flash media), there is no actual *physical* block to prevent writing. Thus, as was stated in comment 4:

>>an attacker could alter the contents of a Tails USB stick if he were to gain control over a running Tails session.

>the HDDs are not mounted, so cannot be read or written.

A sophisticated and determined enough attacker can still mount and gain access to any connected media. 

(How great a risk this is would obviously depend on the individual use case. I think it can safely be said that if that if a TLA*-grade adversary is interested in you, you wouldn't be unreasonable to be worried about connected media (drives). How much below that would still be a concern, I'll leave to others to give some idea of.)

*TLA= \"Three-Letter-Agency\", e.g., FBI, CIA, NSA, MI5, etc.

>any surviving malware in RAM would get wiped when the power is shut down.

In *RAM*, yes, but...see above.
