Regarding keeping separate, dedicated computers (Point # 5 in comment 9): Used, older laptops may provide a practical option. I got one a year ago on ebay for under $100.00 (U.S.) and I am impressed by how well it runs Tails. (1GB RAM, Pentium M @2GHZ).

NewEgg regularly offers refurbished laptops with DualCore CPUs and 2GB of RAM for sale prices in the $200- range, such as this Dell currently available for $204-:

Of course, when acquiring *used/second-hand* hardware, there is the concern of possibly greater risk of obtaining a system with a BIOS rootkit or other firmware infection.

Perhaps someone could shed some light here-- including providing some info on how to check hardware for the presence of such infections.

The ideal setup would be to have *three* separate, discrete, systems:

- One for *general*,  non-anonymous usage

- One for *sensitive*, non-anonymous usage (such as financial transactions, anything involving the likes of a Social Security Number, etc.)

- One for Tor/Tails usage
