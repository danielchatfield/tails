>i was wondering about this too. are there any cheap, disposable, netbook type computers that have an unalterable BIOS? then we can just remove the HDD and use TAILS only with the CD then we are basically impervious to any malware surviving on subsequent reboots at least?

About three years ago netbooks were the rage. Asus produced some excellent netbooks that cost about 400 to 500 US dollars.

However the hard drives in the netbooks are irremovable. They are soldered on to the motherboards.
