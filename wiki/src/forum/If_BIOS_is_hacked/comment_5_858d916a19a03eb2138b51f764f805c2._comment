>For a Tails USB installation without persistence, there is actually a way to check against tampering that one can do as often as one likes: Checking the cryptographic hash (sha256 or sha1 sum) against that of the isohybrid ISO from which the stick was made. The two hashes should match.

Could you provide a specific step-by-step guide on how to check the cyptographic hash please?
