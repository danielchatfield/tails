I have taken all the proper steps installing Tails onto a 1TB hard drive. I hit F12 during boot, select USB HDD, Tails screen appears, I choose Live, Loading, Please Wait...a command line into a three colored (white,light blue,dark blue) bar appears right to left, it ends with an entire white bar and the words Debian 6.0.6 highlighted white. The screen remains frozen.

When attempting the same first steps and choosing to load in Live(failsafe) option I am stuck at the first "Loading, Please Wait..." with no continuation to colored bar.

I used the USB Installer recommended from the Tails site.

Any help would be great.

Thanks.
