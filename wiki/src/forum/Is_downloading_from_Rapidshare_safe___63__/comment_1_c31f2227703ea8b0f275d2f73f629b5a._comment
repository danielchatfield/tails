Rapidshare and similar websites are the ones I do not use.

* those websites are loaded with scripts which try to locate you, so they can display \"localized advertisements\". Most keep, at least, a history. See yourself: the delay timer increases with every file you download. They want to sell you the \"premium\" package, to earn a buck or two. Hence the warnings you see in Tails / Tor.
* I suspect those websites are monitored by anti-piracy organizations. No need to draw unwanted attention.
* I find it unwise to download / send massive amounts of data using Tails / TOR. Why take the risk? Overloading the network is also very RUDE to the ones who really depend on it. Rude, to the volunteers which offer bandwidth so others can use TOR / TAILS.
