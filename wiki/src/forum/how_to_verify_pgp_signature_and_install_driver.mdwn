hello everybody,
i downloaded tails (tails-i386-0.12.1.iso) and it's signature (tails-i386-0.12.1.iso.pgp) and i tried to verify with kleopatra (left click on the signature and click on "Decrypt and Verify" and then choose the ISO file.
it says: not enough inforamation to check signature validity.
what is the problem?


the second question is what about using USB adapter that needs installing of driver? how can i install the driver when i use TAILS without damaging the privacy and security?

THANK YOU VARY MUCH! :-)
