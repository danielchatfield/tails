> Why is Tails team harvesting such information from its users without consent?

About *consent*: Tails does many things without users' consent,
because most users use Tails precisely to avoid caring about
many, many details. I'm sorry if this feature is not documented
well enough. Could you please check if it is?

About *why*: you just quoted the reason: \"requests made to the
security announcements feed\".

What better design would you suggest so that Tails users are
promptly informed of security issues in the version of Tails
they're running?

> Please provide a way to disable security announcement connection. Thank you

Tails is [[free software|contribute/git]].
Good patches [[are welcome|contribute/how/code]].

But first, I guess you'd want to think about the threat model and
see what you would really gain by doing this, once put
in context.
