> Tails is about privacy, and Tails team are included in people who should'nt be allowed to violate it in anyway.

Tails is about privacy, yes, but I find it slightly unfair to use
this as a wide and generic argument like you do. E.g. the Tails
web browser has a homepage, so it connects to the Internet, and
even... to our website. This might be seen as a privacy violation
in some threat models. Please read our [[design
goals|contribute/design]] to learn what threat model Tails is
designed to deal with.

> If an auto security message will let Tails team know I have used Tails each and every time, I'd prefer doing it manually.

It will let us know *someone* has started Tails at a given time. That's all. The Tails team does not even get the IP of the exit node being used, as our web hosting provider (boum.org) does not save this information.
