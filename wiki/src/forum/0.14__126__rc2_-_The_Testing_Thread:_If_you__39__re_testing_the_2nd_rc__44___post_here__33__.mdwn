###Within: What's new since 0.14~rc1?

I don't see any mention of browser extensions updated. Why not?

In an older version of Tails, there was a greasemonkey script to play YouTube videos via HTML5. Do you plan on adding this functionality again in this or another way?

Can you please add a good download manager like *UGET?*

Can you please add a good IRC client like *irssi?*

What version of Tor are you using? Whether it's stable or beta, please use the latest version but beware if you go beta/alpha and release a non-testing version, there are often major changes to beta/alpha versions so I encourage you to use the stable release.

In: 

System->Preferences->Preferred Applications->Multimedia
