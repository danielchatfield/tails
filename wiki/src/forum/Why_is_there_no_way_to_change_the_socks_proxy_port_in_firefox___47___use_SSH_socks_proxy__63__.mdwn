Hi


I would like to use an ssh socks proxy on top of tor, to hide the fact that I'm using node.

I can "ssh -ND 9000 user@sshhost" but then even if I change the port for socks proxy in torbutton, the traffic still goes through tor only (ie the tor exit node) and not through my ssh socks proxy.

This works with the "normal" TBB, installed on debian.

Can you tell me why it doesn't work with tails, and if that can be fixed or not?

Thanks!
