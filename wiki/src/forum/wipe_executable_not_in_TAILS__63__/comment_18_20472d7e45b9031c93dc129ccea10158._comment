Thanks for your guidance but I still have some questions to ask you:

>Not quite sure what you mean about examples. I was referring to selective deletion (i.e. specific file(s) or partitions rather than whole media)

I'm sorry if I haven't been specific enough. I was referring to securely erasing the whole USB thumb/flash drive.

>\"Best\" depends on the nature of the attack you anticipate, so without that information it's impossible to say.

I would want to deter an adversary from recovering data from my USB thumb drive. I would prefer to increase the number of passes so that the chances of data recovery are reduced to zero.

>sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdχ

>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdχ

Where do you execute the above commands? In Tails (root terminal) or Microsoft Windows (command prompt)? As stated in my earlier post, I'm quite new to computing stuff.
