>The [...] Chinese Communist Party and its PLA

If an adversary this large and organised is *determined* to retrieve your data... and if life and/or liberty depend on frustrating them... *especially* the life and/or liberty of *others*... then you clearly have a moral *imperative* to *guarantee* secure destruction of the data. The **only** way to guarantee destruction of the data is to *destroy the medium*. Burn the sticks. Under these circumstances *you must destroy all tainted media the moment they have served their purpose*. Isn't this *obvious* to someone in the position you claim?

Flash memory is cheap and easy to come by. Can you say the same of the lives of your collaborators?


>Having learned the techniques of internet censorship, data espionage and data recovery from the likes of Cisco, HP, CIA, MI5, Mossad, Russian SVR, etc...

There's no need to over-sell your point. I don't imagine CIA, MI5, MOSSAD, SVR, etc. are running security/oppression classes for Chinese security forces.. and I very much doubt there'd be much need for them even if they were.
