>>If it's flash media you intend to erase data from, then you should be aware that it's no simple task.

>I am quite new to computing stuff.

Fair enough ;)

>Could the poster give a few examples to illustrate what he meant by \"....that it's no simple task\"?

Not quite sure what you mean about examples. I was referring to selective deletion (i.e. specific file(s) *or partitions* rather than whole media)

>So what are the best procedures to undertake to securely erase USB thumb/flash drives?

\"Best\" depends on the nature of the attack you anticipate, so without that information it's impossible to say. For example, the more passes, the lower the chances of recovery but the sooner you'll wear out the device. Destroying the medium *is* the only *sure* method. The next best thing is probably to erase the device as someone described above.. a couple of passes from urandom:

    sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdχ

...perhaps followed by zeros:

    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdχ

Obviously you'll have to replace \"χ\" with whatever letter is relevant for your target device... and be **sure** to get it right!

>Please stop feeding the troll peeps.

Sorry! Hope this doesn't count as troll food!.. That one *was* addressed to me... and it stands out for its civility ;)
