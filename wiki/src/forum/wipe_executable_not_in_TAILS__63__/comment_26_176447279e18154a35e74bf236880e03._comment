Assuming you want to securely remove a file on hard drive, presumably created in a persistent volume while using Tail, and assuming you are using Tails 0.13, then try the equivalent utility, shred.  In a konsole (shell) type \"man shred\" to see the man page.  If you have a file you want to wipe, try typing \"shred -zuvn2 filename\" in the directory where the file is located.  

I just tested this with a file created in RAM while running Tails off the DVD. Shredding it was probably pointless, but the command did work.
