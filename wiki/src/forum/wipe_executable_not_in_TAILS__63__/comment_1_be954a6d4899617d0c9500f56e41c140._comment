1. Look the documentation on how to [[securely delete files and clean diskspace |doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]].
2. Look at the documentation on `srm` (from the `secure-delete` package): `man srm`
3. Look at the documentation on `shred` (from the `coreutils` package): `man schred`

Is there really a need for more?
