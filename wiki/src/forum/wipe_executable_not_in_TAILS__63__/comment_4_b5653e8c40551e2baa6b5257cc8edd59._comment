Being too lazy to find [the excellent article on the subject](https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion/index.en.html) by clicking on the conspicuous and omnipresent \"[Documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)\" link (see right --->)

Choosing instead to post something of an impatient rant on the forum

But (of course) being to lazy to actually go to the trouble of fully explaining the intent behind the rant

You demand an answer from a small community of volunteers!

Then, upon finding two mildly sarcastic but surprisingly full and helpful replies, you have the gall to launch another worthless mindless patronising rant?

Why?

P.S. From one \"moderator\" to another, by what means are you appointing \"moderator\" status?

More than you really deserved:

>Using TAILS, I noticed that the wipe executable was missing.

No you didn't. You just didn't look.

>Shouldn't wipe be available to the common TAILS user? 

It is.

>If not, why not?

It is.

>The use case for having the wipe executable in TAILS is that when you download and save a file on a USB, and later want to wipe it[...]

Equally relevant over other buses

>[...]you cannot currently do it in TAILS because[...] 

Yes you can

>[...]the wipe executable is missing in the TAILS distribution.

No it isn't

>Note: this is while using TAILS 0.13~rc1.

RTFM
