>Tails forum moderator: I am noticing a lot of sarcasm in your recent posts. It is unprofessional. We appreciate all you do. We are just here to ask you, the expert, for advice. We do not need contempt when we are getting shot at and you are in your cushy office. Perspective.

I fully agree with your view. Indeed it is very rare for genuine moderators to talk down to forum members. It is only the self-appointed ones that are the black sheep.

If you happen to read this post of mine, remember that when Tails are asking for donations, you have a good reason to withhold your gifting. (cf. A few months ago Truecrypt appealed for donations. As expected I did not donate as the staff were too arrogant. Look at them now: their software version is STILL stuck at 7.1a)
