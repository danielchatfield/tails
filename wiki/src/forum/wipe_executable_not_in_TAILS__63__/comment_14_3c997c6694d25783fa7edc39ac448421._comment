Tails and TBB have been the curse of many an oppresive regime. Communist China employs about 50,000 college graduates just to censor the internet. Many Tor relays and bridges are being \"dismantled\" by them as we speak. It is next to impossible for users in China to use Tails with any measure of success.

I knew the day would come for enemies of Tails to infiltrate this forum and posing as moderators or beings of superior intellect, they will attempt to drive away potential Tails adopters by belittling or talking down to the latter.

The anonymity that Tails offers is proportional to the number of its users. More users means a higher degree of anonymity. If there are fewer users, oppressive regimes will find it relatively easier to suppress free speech and persecute those who dare to so much as express dissimilar viewpoints.
