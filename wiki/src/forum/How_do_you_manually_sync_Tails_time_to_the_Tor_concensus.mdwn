When typing "bridge" at Tails boot screen you are now using bridge mode.


Time syncing does not always work perfectly


Once Tor is up and running how do I make sure my system clock is set to the correct time?

1. What time should it be set to?
2. How do I set it to the Tor concensus time or whatever time it is supposed to be set to
3. Can/should I use the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-time.sh script to auto-sync to the correct time?


Should I edit the timeout in 20-time.sh and make it longer, before I plug in the network cable? The 75 + 75 seconds seems too short for using bridges
