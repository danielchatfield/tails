Not the OP, but I wrote Comment 2.  I understand you to say that attempting to start threads which \"push the boundaries\" just a bit (for example, by posting links likely to be of interest to many Tails users) may be acceptable if the OP tries to explain why he/she thinks the link should be worthwile for Tails users to visit.  If I misunderstood, please say so.

BTW, I think I saw some changes in the Tails documentation incorporate some material from one or two threads to which I contributed, which is gratifying.  And thanks for providing Tails.  Some privacy yet lives, hurrah!
