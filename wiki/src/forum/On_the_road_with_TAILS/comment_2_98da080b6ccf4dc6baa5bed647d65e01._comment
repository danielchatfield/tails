I am not the OP, but I can guess why he/she provided the link to that particular page at eff.org, which discusses practical steps travelers can take when carrying sensitive data through airport/border checkpoints: many Tails users need to travel internationally, and do so, and at least two Tails users seem to believe that it is legitimate to discuss here how (if?) one should try to take a live Tails DVD or USB stick through a checkpoint, on the not unreasonable presumption that one will be confronted with a demand to let the border guards search your persistent data.

Note that any encryption is likely to be viewed as a \"red flag\", so if you are carrying a LUKS encrypted USB stick with Tails...
