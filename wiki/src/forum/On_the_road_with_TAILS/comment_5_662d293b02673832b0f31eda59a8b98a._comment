> I understand you to say that attempting to start threads which \"push the boundaries\" just a bit (for example, by posting links likely to be of interest to many Tails users) may be acceptable if the OP tries to explain why he/she thinks the link should be worthwile for Tails users to visit. If I misunderstood, please say so.

I don't think that being \"of interest to many Tails users\" is enough to make anything relevant here, and would anyway probably be pure speculation: the only sure fact about Tails users is that... they use Tails, so let's keep it at that :)

An URL, however, may be a good starting point to start a discussion *about Tails*, that does not push the boundaries at all. What I meant is that the URL alone would feel like that, without any context and facts or questions to actually *start the discussion*.
