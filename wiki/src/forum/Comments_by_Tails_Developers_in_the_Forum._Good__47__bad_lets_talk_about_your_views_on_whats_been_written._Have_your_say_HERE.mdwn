In most of the Forum pages there are comments signed by Tails. I'm sure most of us welcome input from the developers but what do we really think of whats written?

In the interest of making TAILS the best it can be, and daresay to attempt to keep blogs on topic, lets have a forum dedicated to feedback on whats good and bad about comments made by TAILS

Comments posted by TAILS in other pages will obviously refer to the subject which was being discussed. It is not the intention to simply revisit these arguments but to have a discussion about how constructive and useful you thought TAILS comments were. 

Put simply : On a scale of 1 to 10 how do you rate TAILS commenting?

This is your chance,  HAVE YOUR SAY
