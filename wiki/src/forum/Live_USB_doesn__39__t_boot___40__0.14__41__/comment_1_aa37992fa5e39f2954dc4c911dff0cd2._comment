It looks like you got a boot prompt.  Did you try pressing the Enter key?

What happens to me is I may get a black screen with simply the message: 

    Boot error 

in the upper left-hand side of the screen.

When I get a Boot error like this I hit Ctrl-Alt-F7 which usually gets a 

    boot: 

prompt on the black screen to which I hit the Enter key.  

Then Tails boots up for me.
