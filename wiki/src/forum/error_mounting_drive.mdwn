Every time I try to mount an encrypted drive it says "Unable to mount error mounting:mount:you must specify the filesystem type"
As I don't really play around with Linux other than tails I don't know what to do.
It lets me unlock the drive and even change the passphrase
It used to work on all the other releases until I opened it once after I upgraded to .12.1 
Any help would be much appreciated.
