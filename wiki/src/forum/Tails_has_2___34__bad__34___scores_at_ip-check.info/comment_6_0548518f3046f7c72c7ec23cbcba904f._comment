Sure.

**About the e-tags.** I'm not exactly sure what this relates to. But if I got it right it's just a cache issue that could make your browser trackable (for example, from one connection to another). First, when using Tails, which is amnesic, all the cache will be destroyed between separate working session. And as stated on our warning page, [[Tails doesn't magically separate your different contextual identities|doc/about/warning]]. So if you are worried about being tracked while browsing different websites with different contextual identities during a same working session, you should reboot instead.

**About the fonts.** The way Tor and Tails provide anonymity is by trying to make all of their users look the same, then you can't differentiate a user from any other one. In that sense it's not a problem if all Tails users present the same list of fonts. That won't brake your anonymity amongst all Tails users. So instead of worrying about what ip-check says about the font list, I would rather **not modify the fonts settings** not to differentiate myself from other Tails users.
