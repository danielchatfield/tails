\"To be honest, once I've glanced over such a comment, and noticed that it contains unrelated, undocumented and probably useless tricks\"

All of the 'tricks' in the first reply work well, especially disabling the referrer feature. If you want your Google search terms and wherever you surf stored by remote websites, then you're not thinking clearly about the purpose of this distro for security/privacy.

A savvy user would disable referrer tracking unless they find a site which appears broken due to disabling referrer tracking, then the user may re-enable this feature temporarily.

Now I'll put an end to the brain dead comments:

\"unrelated\"

The referrer blocking tips were not unrelated, they are geared towards better security/privacy.

\"undocumented\"

All modifications mentioned are detailed on Mozilla's site, use Google if you need to find them fast.

\"and probably useless tricks\"

Useless? You said they were unrelated, which is false, you said they were undocumented, which is false, and you say they are \"useless tricks\" which is not only false, but stupid.

I hope you're not a Tails developer, if so, I fear for this project.
