To be honest, once I've glanced over such a comment, and noticed that it contains unrelated, undocumented and probably useless tricks (such as the disableIPV6 one), as well as suggestions that break *many* websites (such as blindly disabling referers), then I have a hard time reading the rest carefully and taking it seriously. One may find thousand of people online who happen to have many \"privacy boost\" suggestions, and I have no time to consider every writing of them. Sorry.

On the other hand, suggesting us carefully selected changes, and providing good reasons why we should do this in Tails (and generally, also in the TBB), is welcome.
