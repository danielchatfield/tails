OK. Thanks, it works.

But do I have to do all these steps every time I reboot Tails? It is advised to reboot Tails for evey distinct \"identity\", so I reboot Tails quite often.

Firstly, I made the whole .mozilla directory persistent (through like any custom persistent directory) but then I thought it is not good for privacy, because .mozilla directory has cache and other subdirectories which should be reset after each system reboot in order to keep privacy. So what should be a solution?
