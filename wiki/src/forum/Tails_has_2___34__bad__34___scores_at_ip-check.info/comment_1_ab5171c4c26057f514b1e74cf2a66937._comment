>\"Cache (E-Tags)\" \"Bad: Your browser is trackable by e-tags.\"

- This should help:

1. Right-click Torbutton (in Tor Browser/Firefox)
2. Select Preferences
3. Select Security Settings
4. Select Cache
5. Change to the second setting, \"Block disk and memory cache access during Tor\"
6. Reload ip-check.info test and the E-Tags warning should be gone

>\"Fonts\" \"Bad: 48 installed fonts have been found on your computer.\"

- This may help (Part I)

1. Select Edit in Tor Browser (Firefox)
2. Select Preferences
3. Select Content
4. Select Advanced (under Fonts & colors)
5. In the Fonts window, un-check the following: \"Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of my selections above\" which will force most sites to use your settings rather than your own.
6. Set your Minimum font size to a size you enjoy

- This may help (Part II)

1. Use your package manager or command line equivalent to list then remove all font packages except for US English.
2. Double check any desktop language/keyboard tools if they exist for font settings and only use US English as the selected setting.
3. Reload ip-check.info test

- Optional:

I enjoy the following settings in Tor Browser's (Firefox) about:config:

Disable referrer tracking: (a boost for privacy)

1. about:config
2. network.http.sendrefererheader (change to 0)
3. network.http.sendsecorexsitereferrer (change to false)

Disable network prefetching: (another privacy boost)

1. about:config
2. network.prefetch-next (change to false)

Disable IPV6: (assuming it's not in use on your system)

1. about:config
2. network.dns.disableIPV6 (change to true)

If you're curious about my recommendations, Google first! Most of the information on these settings exist on Mozilla's site.
