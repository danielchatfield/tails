Besides the various random bugfixes and improvements are there actually any important security bugs fixed in the release that could pose a problem for people that don't upgrade?

I ask this question because virtualbox support in Tails is essential to me and since Tails 0.17.1 doesn't appear to include any real virtualbox support at all and there doesn't seem to be any huge security improvements I will likely stay behind on Tails 0.17 until virtualbox support is restored in Tails.
