Would it be possible to suggest a switch-over to LibreOffice from the present OpenOffice.org? I think that many find it to be a more user friendly and all-round better fork of OpenOffice.

Backwards compatibility would not be an issue and I presume neither would storage space.

If not, are there any compelling reasons to keep OpenOffice?
