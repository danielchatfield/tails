I have been trying to do the command line verification of the Tails iso image for the last couple of hours. I even tried looking at some general tutorials about the command line. But I still can't get it. Could anyone possibly tell me in a more literal way than the guide here, how to verify the image in the command line? 

As in, "assuming you downloaded the key to the Desktop folder, now word for word do EXACTLY as follows". 

And not assuming I'm normally a linux user, as I'm not.

I did see someone say the devs try to make things accessible to the less knowledgeable/not as smart users(that's me), too. I hope in that spirit you might help me?
