For some reason my system no longer wipes RAM on shutdown.  At the top it says on shutdown, 'Warning' across from 'Stopping memory wiping on live media removal'.  I don't know if this is related.  Please help.

For more information, I am running a TAILS LiveUSB with persistence, used only for a saved network password.
