I think exasperation is more likely. Most of the time anyway.

*Empty vessels make the most noise*

...and that has certainly been true around here of late. This forum is becoming bogged down with interminable rambling posts from commenter(s) who clearly don't understand anything of what they're rambling on about. Nor do they heed the (often rather terse) interjections of reason or follow the links they are given.
