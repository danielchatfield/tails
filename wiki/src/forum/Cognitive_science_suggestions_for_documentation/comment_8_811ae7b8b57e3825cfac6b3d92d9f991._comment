Perhaps I will, if this is something desired by the developers (and thus the work expended will not go to waste).

Mind that I have no experience doing video-editing but I guess I could learn to \"give back\" to tails. If so, I'll probably have a bit more free time to tackle this in the beginning of next year.

Regardless of whether or not I end up doing it, perhaps tails devs could state that their wish this video-documentation in the wiki or within a todo item. Some coordination from tails devs could ensure that everyone who wishes to work on this can without being dependent on any single individual.

Most importantly perhaps, making a list of which programs (and features within) is necessary/welcome and a way for volunteers to state the video they are working on (as to no work get duplicated).
