Since all but a handful of posters use the handle \"Anonymous\", unless you take particular pains to link to a particular post, no-one will know who you are talking about.

@ Comment 1:

Just curious; did you follow the link given in the OP?

If you have some technical point to explain in some thread here, I'd urge you to go ahead and try to explain it in your own words, although links would also be welcome.  I think that, ideally, such discussions are just what this forum should offer.

And trying your hand at exposition could benefit you.  There is much anectodal evidence to support the old adage that the best way to deepen your own understanding of something you think you understand is to try to explain it as clearly as possible to someone else.  I expect you will discover:

* you didn't understand as well as you thought
* after writing up a good explanation, you really will understand, better

> Surely the remedy for ignorance (or \"simplistic thinkers\" as you seem to have dubbed it) is education.

Did you miss the point?  I was suggesting that:

* simplistic thinkers are offended by discussions of technical points, and reject invitations to learn, so they won't follow links
* subtle thinkers will welcome opportunities to learn, will read documentation, will follow links, will think critically about what they read, and may be inclined to post more detailed discussions than simplistic thinkers can stomach
* since Tails is for everyone, documentation should address the needs of both populations, striving to persuade simplistic thinkers without offending them, while also satisfying the need of subtle thinkers to read more detailed discussions of often complex issues.

See the story in the link in the OP.
