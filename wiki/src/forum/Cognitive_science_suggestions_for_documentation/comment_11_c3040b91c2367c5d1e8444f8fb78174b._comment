As said, current Tails developers do not have the resources to make screencasts. Our energy regarding user education is taken by written documentation, answers to bug reports and other private emails and this forum. Other education tools are highly welcome!

No one actually need developers support to create screencasts, and if you search around you will already find some videos doing some shallow covering of Tails.

> Mind that I have no experience doing video-editing but I guess I could learn to \"give back\" to tails. If so, I'll probably have a bit more free time to tackle this in the beginning of next year. Regardless of whether or not I end up doing it, perhaps tails devs could state that their wish this video-documentation in the wiki or within a todo item.

The first step of anyone who wishes to make screencast that could be endorsed by current Tails developers would probably be to write for each screencast:

 * a set of goals: ideas to convey, use case to support, etc.,
 * a detailed script: what should appear on the screen, which actions should
   be made, what does the voice over says.

Most of [[Tails documentation|doc]] could benefit from being covered through screencasts. A first video could be to cover the download + signature verification + burning process, for example.

Tails website is a wiki. If you wish to add a new todo item for video work, feel free. Then please ask on the development mailing-list for reviews once you feel a script is ready.

This requires a lot of efforts, but doors are wide open. :)

> While I'm at it, I'd predict that 98% of earth people would't understand or have the patience to figure out how to veriify the signatures, keys or whatever it is -(I gave up), which pretty much undermines the whole point of Tails as a ready a ready set, up-working out of the box solution to anything.

Here's a quote from [Bruce Schneier's Secret and Lies](https://www.schneier.com/book-sandl-pref.html)Â :

    In my vision cryptography was the great technological
    equalizer; anyone with a cheap (and getting cheaper
    every year) computer could have the same security
    as the largest government. [...]
    Cryptography is a branch of mathematics. And like all
    mathematics, it involves numbers, equations, and logic.
    Security, palpable security that you or I might find
    useful in our lives, involves people: things people
    know, relationships between people, people and how
    they relate to machines. Digital security involves
    computers: complex, unstable, buggy computers. [...]
    I found that the weak points had nothing to do with
    the mathematics. They were in the hardware, the software,
    the networks, and the people. Beautiful pieces of
    mathematics were made irrelevant through bad programming,
    a lousy operating system, or someone's bad password choice.
    I learned to look beyond the cryptography, at the entire
    system, to find weaknesses. I started repeating a couple
    of sentiments you'll find throughout this book: \"Security
    is a chain; it's only as secure as the weakest link.\"
    \"Security is a process, not a product.\"

Tails developers wish to offer security to Tails users. This means that Tails cannot just be a *working out of the box solution*. Using Tails is also about learning the right processes. Making sure that you are not putting your life in the hand of backdoored software is one of them, even if it is hard to grasp at first.

Videos could definitely help some users! :)
