interesting link. I know that there is a large segment of the population that does not want to invest thought in products they buy.Apple capitalizes on this by setting up your phone and Ipad before you leave. You don't have to figure out how to do it yourself. Others, like me, hate the idea of a product being sold for such a high prices knowing that it has been crippled in a way to be tied to the Apple profit stream. Can you imagine buying a new car then finding out that say, Irving, was the only gas station that would sell you gas for it???
