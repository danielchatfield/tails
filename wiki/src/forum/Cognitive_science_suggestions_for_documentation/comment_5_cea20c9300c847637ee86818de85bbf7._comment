This was a great post! I was always suspecting something like this and now your post enlighten me.

Did you read some studies on how short users stay on a website? It's just seconds...

> This raises the rather awful question: in a on-line environment in which average citizens are increasingly exposed to more and more subtle/sophisticed threats from more and more capable adversaries targeting everyone, will simplistic thinkers be literally selected against by lethal adversaries?

Yes! Damn it! Yes!

Problem? There are much... Much... Much more simple thinkers than subtle thinkers. Think about all the simple thinkers who neither read the docs and also do not bother to read and post the forums.

There are too few subtle thinkers. Problem? Anonymity needs a big group of people.

Enjoy anonymity, stenography and cryptography as long it lasts. The arms race of developers and adversaries will make things so complicated, that only a minority will be able to understand and use the tools correctly. There is no anonymity in a minority.
