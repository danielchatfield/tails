Surely the remedy for ignorance (or \"simplistic thinkers\" as you seem to have dubbed it) is education. The uninformed user can't/doesn't argue with the docs - they argue on the forum, so the docs offer a perfect opportunity to educate the uninformed *without* subjecting the rest of us to the chaff. To squander this opportunity by concealing information from those who need it would be counter-productive.
