or perhaps videos.. 5 min Youtube-like documentation videos for those who only want to learn fast and simple how to use a program within tails.

But that wont solve the forum problem. Unfortunately the troll(s) in this forum show a level of education. Their comments are educated enough that, although contain lies and FUD, have truth mixed in them. They seem almost designed to generate doubt and mistrust. And when faced with truth, ignore it and raise the same points again and again. 

This requires intelligence and determination and \"simplistic thinkers\" would not be able to make this (trolling) comments as effectively. I believe this to be an attacker.

Still, it does not mean cognitive science cannot help creating a better (or more suited) documentation. And if exhaustive and clear enough, provide a tool to stop a tread from derailing with a quick link, instead of wasting time deconstructing trolls comments.
