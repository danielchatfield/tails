Well, I detect a generally higher intolerance of 'unworthy' questions in 'puter forums than anywhere else. Rather than say 'if you mean this, then this is the answer..else' etc. they just love to leave you a cryptic quesrtion and none the wiser. It's pathetic. So I like the op's tack but am more cynical.

While I'm at it, I'd predict that 98% of earth people would't understand or have the patience to figure out how to veriify the signatures, keys or whatever it is -(I gave up), which pretty much undermines the whole point of Tails as a ready a ready set, up-working out of the box solution to anything. 

But as long as you feels suitably superior then thats all that matters...
