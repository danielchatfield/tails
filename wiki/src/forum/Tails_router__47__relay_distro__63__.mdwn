Has anyone considered modifying or creating a dedicated Tor relay or exit-node distro?

Rather than so many 'cooks spoiling the broth' on live-CDs to anonymize a single user's traffic, what about something an end-user can throw on their old PC or a dedicated machine in an office, school, etc that will act as a Tor node for that whole LAN?  ie: point your LAN gateway or proxy at that machine instead of the default gateway, and everything piped through it will be routed via Tor.

Of course there are many, many levels this could be edited on, but a distro that is easy to configure via GUI would be best (I think of something such as ipcop to compare)
