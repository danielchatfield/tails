yes it's the destination, the source path for the .ISO is fine.

I take it that cat && sync only works on the whole drive and not with a specific partition then.

Is having two partitions not recomended?

I installed the ISO manually and made it bootable with gparted and syslinux in the end. The spare partition is for encrypted storage and works great from tails and I can't see any inconvenience.

If there's a good reason not to do this though I would be very interested to hear
