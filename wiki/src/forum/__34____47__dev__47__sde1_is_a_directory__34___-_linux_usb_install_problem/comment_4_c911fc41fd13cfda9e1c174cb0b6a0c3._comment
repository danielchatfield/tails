ok thanks,

I saw the plans for that feature and am looking forward to it. Will it be possible to support ext filesystem for both the storage and boot partitions though?

Ext has always been faster and more reliable for booting OS's in my experience and when plugged into windows it will just look like a corrupted fs rather than fully read/writable and full of suspicious files. Regarding speed, ext4 mounted with out journalling is slightly better than ext 2. Both offer better results than vfat though. I had a good source with extensive research but I can't find it anymore. Maybe I'll come back with the information later.
