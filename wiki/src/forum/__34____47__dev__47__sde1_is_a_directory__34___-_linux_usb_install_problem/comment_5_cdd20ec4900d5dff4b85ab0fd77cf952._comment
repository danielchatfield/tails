> Will it be possible to support ext filesystem for both the storage and boot partitions though?

The system partition will be FAT (some day, we want our USB installer
to work on Windows), while the persistent filesystem will probably
be ext3.

> Ext has always been faster and more reliable for booting OS's in my experience

Do you think this is really relevant in the context of Tails, where
the (OS) FAT filesystem is only used read-only at boot time, and
merely contains the kernel / initramfs and a big SquashFS file?
I doubt it.

This is a very valid point. In our (limited) experience, Windows often
suggested to format such partitions when it does not know how to read
the filesystem. This looked dangerous to us. That's why the system
partition will get the needed GPT attributes so that Windows just
*ignores* it. Less worried about it?

My experience with ext4 is quite less rock-solid than ext3.
Unless we are given pretty good reasons to use ext4, chances are we
keep our safe ext3 initial decision.
