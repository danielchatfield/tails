This is just another topic of its own from its previous topic.
Windows obviously has a vaster selection of programs (albiet less open source), but since it is almost universal having access to ones of your choice could be highly beneficial and handy to some.

Here's what I'm talking about:

This VM wine works, opens, asks to install, just open, etc.
I experimiented with the one on dropbox. Seems like it could work, I just don't have much if any experience in configuring this to workability if that is the case.

Especially in the virtual machine/wine it would also be cool if it was possible to lock down the program activated from networks and such so you're able to work in a totally secure isolated area.

Just looking for comments again :) Thought this may be worthy of its own thread. Anyone's brain have some expeirence or know-how with this.

Thank ya all.



Peace & Freedom
