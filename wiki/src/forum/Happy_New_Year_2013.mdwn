**Happy New Year 2013** to Tails developers and staff. We wish to thank you guys for:

1. Creating this wonderful software
2. Sacrificing your time to create it
3. Tails' staff for maintaining this forum and patiently answering our questions, however elementary they may seem
4. Tails' staff for not losing their patience with people who are clueless about using Linux
