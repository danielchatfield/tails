The Synaptic Package (software) manager suggests that maccahnger is included in Tails, but I can't figure out how to use it. I have seen the entries in the todo section https://amnesia.boum.org/todo/macchanger/ and recognise the need to use macchanger with caution. But I do think it would be handy to have also included the GUI GTK+ interface for GNU/MACchanger, so it can be used and maybe create somekind of lauch link in Applications to be able to lauch the GUI. 

The FBI was able to intercept the communication, and apparently used MAC addresses to track the participant.

"Law enforcement agents were able to detect a particular MAC address - MAC address A - at the time that Chapman was observed powering on her laptop computer," the complaint says.

"Law enforcement agents were also able to determine that the electronic device associated with MAC address A created the ad hoc network."
