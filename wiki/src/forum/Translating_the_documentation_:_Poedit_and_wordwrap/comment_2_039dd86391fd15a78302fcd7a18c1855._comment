Thanks. Did you considered the second solution ?
> give up this wordwrapping (no needs to msgcat after Poedit anymore, that can be hard for some contributors), depending on how usefull wordwrap is (I have no clue about this)..

Even if   *for f in $(find . -type f -name *.po) ; do msgcat --width=80 -o \"${f}.new\" \"$f\" ; mv -f \"${f}.new\" \"$f\" ; done*   seems to make the work much more easier, I'm afraid a lot of commit and modification from the piggy-web interface will not be 80 char. large. Perhaps is it not so important.. but I don't know what is this wordwrapping for, and it has been getting on my nerves ;)

Great thanks !
