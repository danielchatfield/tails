some considerations:

* Tails primary use case is to use the internet anonymously.
    * You will be logging in to your bank, so you will not be anonymous.

* The fact that you can boot Tails off a CD/DVD makes it much less likely that your computing session will be watched by operating system based malware.

* You will be using encryption (SSL) to communicate with your bank (even through tor) 

* Many keyloggers exist in keyboards (in the physical device)
    * (Maybe true) Using cut and paste to fill in the characters of your password should circumvent most keyloggers.

* There are reports of malware at the BIOS level on computers
