Don't know if this will go, since it says the thread is closed. Just wanted to thank the commenters for all the excellent answers to my questions.

The other thing I found out last night, after sitting down with an ssh tunneling how-to and reading it carefully, is that it's actually not difficult. I have it set up and am insufferably pleased with myself.

plus -- added bonus -- I now have a Tails usb stick for when anonymity is nice.

Thanks to all!
