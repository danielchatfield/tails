Assuming your bank uses HTTPS (all banks does I hope), and assuming you are using your own computer to connect to the bank, using Tails or not will not make any difference.

The public wifi is untrusted, and Tor exit nodes is untrusted. What you want is HTTPS, which encrypts and authenticates the traffic to your bank. In Firefox you should get a green bar with a green lock icon next to the URL.

Now, if you are going to use a public computer, do bring your own operating system, yes. But really do use your own computer if at all possible.
