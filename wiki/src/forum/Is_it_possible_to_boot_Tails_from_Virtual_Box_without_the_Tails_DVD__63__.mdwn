I can run Windows 7, Linux Liberte, and a few other operating systems from Virtual Box without their installation DVD, so is it also possible to run Tails from a VM without the Tails Live DVD?. This allows me to conveniently use Tails without carrying the Tails CD around. Plus it lowers the CPU and RAM demands on my computer.
