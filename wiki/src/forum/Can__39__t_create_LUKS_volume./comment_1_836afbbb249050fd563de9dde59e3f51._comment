You can try waiting, or unmouting/disconnect the drive between each steps.. .

Anyway, I don't think you have to send it back to the store. 

I'm not shure if you can use an encrypted volume *safely* from Windows(R) but if you want to use it again from this operating system, did you try to format your drive in FAT, from Tails ?

Can you paste here the exact error message ?

Good luck,
