How can I edit the torcc file in Tails, I tried by using the edit button in tor, but It will not let me?


Im a major newb on Debian so can you please give me a step by step and include any commands I will need in the terminal.

I dont know if it is even possible, but i would like to be able to edit the torcc file.

Thankk you for your time.
