Don't be afraid to ask... if you don't ask, no one will tell you!

That said, [it's](https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#authenticity-check) in [the docs](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)

If you're feeling terribly impatient, there's a one-liner in [this thread](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Kleopatra.exe_has_stopped_working/) which should set you on your way... but do read the documentation... you'll find it'll tell you how to do stuff, explain important concepts, provide all manner of useful tips and, perhaps most relevantly, save you from wasting hours and hours struggling over something *really simple* which shouldn't have taken you more than ten seconds or so... like typing \"gpg --verify /path/to/and/name/of.iso.sig /path/to/and/name/of.iso\" ;-)
