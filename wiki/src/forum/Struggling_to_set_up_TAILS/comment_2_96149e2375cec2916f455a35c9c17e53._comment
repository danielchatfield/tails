Well, I got really excited for a second.  I was able to drag the iso into Disk Utility, burn the DVD (which now showed up in the Start-up Disk pane of Preferences), and I selected it as the start-up disk.  In the process of rebooting, however, I was notified that \"This is not a bootable disk... insert a bootable disk and try again\"

I will try your other option now, but in the meantime, can think of anything I may have done wrong?

Also, thanks a lot for helping out!
