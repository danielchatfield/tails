Hey there,

Don't worry. It'll work out! Try this:

(on mac too).

1. Download Virtualbox.
2. Create new Virtual Machine and tweak the settings a bit.
3. In (for the VM) Settings -> Storage - > Add CD/DVD Device (either IDE/SATA) and select the TAILS ISO.

4. Boot the VM from the TAILS ISO & Play around.

OR:

1. Open Disk Utility
2. Drag the TAILS ISO to the LEFT PANE.
3. Right click or use the GUI & BURN THE ISO.
4. Once burned use System Preferences -> Start-up Disc & select the TAILS DVD. Or reboot and hold the option key then select the TAILS DVD.

Hope that helps!
