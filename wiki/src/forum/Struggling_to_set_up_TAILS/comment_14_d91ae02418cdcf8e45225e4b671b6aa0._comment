I hope the OP didn't give up, because I think the problem might have been that he/she thought he/she was buring an iso image to make a live DVD when in fact he/she was simply copying the iso image onto the DVD, which of course would result in a message saying that the DVD is not bootable.

If this is the case, most likely studying the GUI of the DVD burning software (maybe Brasero for Linux, something else for Mac) will show different options for making a data CD and burning an iso image to make a live (bootable) DVD.
