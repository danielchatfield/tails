I know that what I'm about to say will annoy most experienced users, but the fact is that I have no idea what it means to \"verify\" or how to use the \"pgp\".  The website assumes that those terms are familiar to everyone.  I downloaded that stuff but there is nothing that I know how to do with it.  I can't click it and I don't know how to use terminal.   

Once again, I do apologise for being a total idiot about this stuff, but I am seriously trying.  Every resource I can find online just assumes that I already know all of the terminology and methods.  I am finding it extremely difficult to make any progress.

This website just runs me around in circles so when I gave up trying to figure out what exactly I was meant to do by verifying the iso, I just gave up on it and decided to give it a try anyway.
