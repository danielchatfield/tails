A diagram which may help:

       yourputer <==> entry <==> relay <==> exit <---> dns server, destination

Each computer in this diagram knows the IP of its neighbor.

The <==> connections are SSL encrypted; the <---> is not in general.

The exit server knows the url you want and calls up a DNS server to find the IP.

That DNS server will log the IP of the exit server and the requested url.

The destination knows the IP of the exit server but not the IP of yourputer.
