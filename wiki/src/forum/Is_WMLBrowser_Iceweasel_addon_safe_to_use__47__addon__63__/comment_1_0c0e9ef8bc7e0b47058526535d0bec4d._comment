... thinking hard before adding any FF/IW addons, which you are doing.  He says that he thinks a few are probably OK to use with Tor:

The list doesn't include WMLBrowser but that could be only because it is new.  In general it seems to be a \"known problem\" that few audits of specific addons have been done to evaluate their safety for Tor users, and also that it may be true that few developers know how to audit their own addon even if they wanted to
