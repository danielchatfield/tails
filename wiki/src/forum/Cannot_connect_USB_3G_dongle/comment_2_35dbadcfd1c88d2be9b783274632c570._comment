Actually, in India, the speed of internet is very slow. You are using 3G dongle but using 2G SIM inside that. Hence due to slow speed which is 2kbps, you are unable to use TOR. I have used it when I used 3G connection but it didn't work when I switched over to 2G connection. 3G is very much costier and unaffordable since it is a new technology there.
