I'm trying to boot from USB and have had no success. 
(OS X 10.7.4)

rEFIt installed: recognizes the USB linux bootable, but cannot boot. Ends in black screen and a prompt.

rEFInd install: does not recognize the USB bootable .

live DVD works fine. so it has to do with either formatting on USB drive or EFI on OS X.

Could use some help.

PS. after trying to boot from live USB using rEFIt, the USB drive loses its \"boot ability\" even on windows PCs. So the mac is changing something.
