I ant even get the usb installation working yet, what format for the usb drive are you using? or what steps did you follow to make the bootable usb.

i tried using terminal steps which work.. but nothing happens, and the short restore method down the bottom of the usb install page dont seem to want to work..

.11 used to work fine, but i am having issues getting .12 working.. i formatted the usb too so no chance of a quick update.

using refit etc.
