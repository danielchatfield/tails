> After rebooting my pc, I received an error message to reformat my external Seagate hard drive. Apparently, tails had been installed on my external hard drive and not on the thumb drive.

Did you click on the wrong disk when you ran the install script, mistaking your external hard drive for the thumb drive?

Sorry, I don't know whether it is possible to recover your data, much less how.  If no one else replies, try reading in Wikipedia about Knoppix and recovery-type live Linux CDs.
