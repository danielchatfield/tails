There are a lot of free utilities to change file properties/attributes, but MAT is the best because it doesn't only wipe even the file creation and modification (n access time) but also wipes the operating system and username data. But unfortunately MAT has limited capability because it doesn't wipe PDF and DOCX files as I have seen many a time.
