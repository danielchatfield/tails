I would like to second this request (actually I enter in this forum to make this request :p), it would we a nicer alternative to the project [JanusVM](http://janusvm.com/) (which is out of date..)
it could have the openvpn package presinstalled and preconfigured to tunnel the traffic through tor (and it would be cool if it could work to i2p as well)

I hope that the Tails developers find this request viable to future releases :P

Also, I don't like to deviate the topic but how can you route all the traffic through i2p instead of Tor in Tails?

Thanks.
