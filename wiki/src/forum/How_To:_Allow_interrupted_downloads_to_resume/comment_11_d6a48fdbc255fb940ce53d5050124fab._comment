>does it support proxies and use via Tails?


(This is my first post to this thread) 

I use aria2c in Tails and it works very well indeed. It creates a \"side-car\" file to the download in which it saves the download status, so it can even resume a segmented pre-allocated file across Tails sessions. Haven't tried it with proxies but it knows about them: there are proxy related settings in the man page. It also handles metalink, torrent, magnet...
