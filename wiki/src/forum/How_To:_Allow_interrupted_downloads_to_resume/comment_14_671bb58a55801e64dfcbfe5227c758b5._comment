Previous poster is right, as stated on the forum/ page :

> The forum is open for discussions that do not belong to bugs, feature requests and the like. Such fauna should rather be submitted on the [dedicated page](https://tails.boum.org/support/found_a_problem/index.en.html), where it can be more easily tracked... and hopefully fixed.

To reply you quickly though, I haven't been able to reproduce your problem. Wget and the http ptoxy are both able to understand the -c argument and go on with the download where it stopped. I used CTRL+C to stop wget though, but I don't think it makes such a difference.
