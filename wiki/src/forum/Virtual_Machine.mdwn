I understand that running Tails inside a virtual machine means that the OS can only leak it&s Tor IP, thereby making it safer. What I don't understand is why. Why would running Tails inside a VM prevent it from leaking the user's real IP in case of misconfiguration, malware attack etc? Also, is it possible to tell whether a given user is using a virtual machine, i.e., does using a VM in any way alter the browser fingerprint?
