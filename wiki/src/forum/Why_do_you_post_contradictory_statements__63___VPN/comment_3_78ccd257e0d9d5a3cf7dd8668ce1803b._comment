An end to end correlation attack works against end points. Also against Tor end points. Against ANY end points.

An end to end correlation attack can be done if they suspect the victim and put the victim under active surveillance. That is one end points. For the other end point they have to compromise the server (or the servers network) they suspect the victim to connect to.
