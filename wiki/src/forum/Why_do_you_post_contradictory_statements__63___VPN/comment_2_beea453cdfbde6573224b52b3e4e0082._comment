In your case the attacker needs to control parts of the Tor network plus the VPN servers (and there are plenty of). The question remains how an attacker would know that you use a specific VPN to enter the Tor network. If you post something on a website one can only see that you used Tor. So if someone wants to deanonymize you he needs control over entry and exit nodes. If his end to end correlation attack is successful he knows you use a VPN. Either you are lucky and the VPN provider keeps no logs or he does and you are fucked or the attacker somehow compromies the VPN as well and you are also fucked.
But if you did not use a VPN in the first place you would be deanonymized right after the end to end correlation attack on the tor network.
So I would say: it depends.
If your VPN provider keeps no logs and does not intent to attack you you are more secure. But if the VPN provider is malicious and also controls some exit nodes you are less anonymous.
