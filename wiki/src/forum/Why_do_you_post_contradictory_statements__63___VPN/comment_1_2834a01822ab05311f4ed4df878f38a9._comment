In short, the issue is that adding a VPN into the mix adds a static/unchanging entry or exit node to you Tor circuit, so if the VPN is malicious, under surveillance or has a MitM:ing ISP etc (let's just call all this *compromised*), you're in a much worse spot than if you didn't use the VPN.

You can have the VPN placed on either side of Tor:

**Case: You -> Tor -> VPN**: Now your VPN is a static exit node, so if it's compromised the attacker can see all your unencrypted traffic, and can always try to do MitM attacks against your encrypted connections. Without a VPN the attacker can only do this if you pick an exit under its control, which is much less likely to happen. This is not too bad though since you should always assume that exits are compromised and protect yourself by using authenticated end-to-end encrypted protocols when dealing with sensitive or identifying data. But it is worse since the *same* exit node gets *all* your data, which certainly will leak some bits of your true identity over time, as opposed to *many* exits only getting *fragments* of your data while not using a VPN.

**Case: You -> VPN -> Tor** (like you described): Now your VPN is a static [Entry Guard](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards), which makes you more susceptible to end-to-end correlation attacks. I.e. if the VPN is compromised and the attacker also controls some exit nodes, then it'll be able to deanonymize you whenever one of its exits is picked by you. Without a VPN you would have to pick an Entry Guard controlled by the same attacker in addition to an exit, which is much less likely to happen.

The common use cases listed for each of these two VPN setups on the [[todo/vpn_support]] page still seems like the only valid ones. I'm sure there are valid obscure use cases too, but that's not really what were interested in. And AFAICT using VPNs will only make you less anonymous, definitely not more.
