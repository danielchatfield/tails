Hi,

> Scroggle often runs into the Google Captcha

I'm not sure what you mean, and I don't think it ever happened to me.
Maybe I'm just censoring my memories.
Could you please elaborate?

How would this get Tails users better privacy and/or anonymity?
Replacing \"being monitorable by random exit nodes\" with \"being
monitorable by one single entity, at one well known central place\"
does not look like an obvious improvement to me.

> The entire search including results is secure. No other search

Could you please elaborate why you think Scroogle's search and results
are not \"secure\"?

> Never any cookies or anything either.

I think this has been the way Scroogle worked for many years.

> Check out ixquick's site. They explain why their search engine won

I failed to found anything convincing there: they explain tons of nice
features that either is of no use to Tails users, and/or have been
proposed by Scroogle for years, and/or boil down to \"you'd better
trust ixquick than Tor exit nodes\" in Tails context.

> Bottom line, ixquick.com is the top privacy aware search engine.
> (No, I'm not affiliated in any way.)

Frankly, these awards don't mean anything to me unless they're shipped
with a threat model compatible with Tails' one.

Please don't take my comments as aggressive: simply put, before
deciding to switch to ixquick, we'd need to be displayed precisely
what kind of improvement ixquick would make for Tails users, and the
\"we like privacy\" label is no such thing. FYI the DuckDuckGo fanclub
has tried already, with similar arguments (SSL, \"privacy friendly\"
marketing, etc.): they failed convincing us.
