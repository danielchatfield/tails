Reliability indeed does count. The \"bypass Tor blocked\" feature is worth it too.
So I'm personally now convinced we should add ixquick to the list of search engines.
I'm not convinced it should become the default, though.

> Does Scroogle have any advantage over Ixquick?

In short: it's working already. It's been on the web and working quite
good for many years. It's been integrated in Tails since
the beginning.

Its default settings are great for Tails usecase, and there are
actually no settings but SSL, language, and number of results per
page, which means the anonymity set is much less split than it is with
ixquick (in ixquick case, we probably would need to generate a custom
URL per-language, that would include all default prefs).

Also, the people who run Scroogle don't boast about being the \"most
private search engine\" with a set of arguments that mostly boil down
to \"trust us, *we*'re not evil\". ixquick does. I don't like this kind
of marketing, mostly because it's likely to create a false feeling of
security in many people's mind.
