In my experience Ixquick is far more reliable than Scroogle. Scroogle times out all the time. For this reason Ixquick should be included.

I've never seen a Captcha for Scroogle. Google usually runs into Google captcha. This may be a reason to dump Google.

DuckDuckGo is included but it doesn't have Google results. It doesn't seem to have as large an index as Scroogle or Ixquick.

I have a vague memory of being able to access some pages through Ixquick's proxy that I could not otherwise access directly using Tor. Tor exit nodes may be blocked while Ixquick is not.

Does Scroogle have any advantage over Ixquick?
