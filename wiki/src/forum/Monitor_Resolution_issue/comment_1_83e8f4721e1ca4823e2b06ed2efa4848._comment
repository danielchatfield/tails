First of all, the forum is not intended for bug reports. Use the \"Report a bug\" tool from inside Tails instead -- that way you can easily supply logs and other system information which can greatly help us debug your problem.

This may be fixed with a [[todo/backported_Xorg]] due to improved hardware support.
