The question above, difference between Tails Changes and WhisperBack debugging info

>BIG question mark: Problem??
Tails Changes: https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.17.1/index.en.html
Update Linux to 3.2.39-2, that It includes better support for graphics adapter, backported from Linux 3.4.29.
WhisperBack: [ 0.000000]Linux version 3.2.0-4-686-pae (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc version 4.6.3 (Debian 4.6.3-14) ) #1 SMP Debian 3.2.35-2


Why this difference?
