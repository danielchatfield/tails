My first two attempts to reply wound up in moderation and never did appear here, but if I could be permitted to say just one thing, please:

> use whatever network testing tool you like to check it's implemented correctly

I am not sure I understand what you mean by \"implemented correctly\", but I did use nmap from another computer on a test LAN to test a computer running Tails booted from a DVD (but with the Tails browser reconfigured to disallow Javascript entirely).  As expected, nmap was unable to identify the CPU or OS.  In extensive tests using both TCP and UDP port scans of *all* ports, nmap reported that all TCP ports are filtered (do not even return \"this port is closed\" type replies), and if I understand results correctly, no ports are open to UDP traffic from the outside either.   These are tests of *inbound* wired connections only.

Much more valuable would be auditing tests which look for vulnerabilities from something which has gotten itself \"installed\" in RAM, or from untilities bundled with Tails (Open Office can be a bit scary, for example), and which are seeking to send *outbound* traffic, particularly if WiFi is enabled.  But that is almost certainly well beyond my abilities.
