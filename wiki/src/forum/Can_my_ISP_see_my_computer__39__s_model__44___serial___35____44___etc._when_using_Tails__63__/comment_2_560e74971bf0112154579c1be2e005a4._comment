\"Mass interception of entire populations is not only a reality, it is a secret new industry spanning 25 countries\"

\"International surveillance companies are based in the more technologically sophisticated countries, and they sell their technology on to every country of the world. This industry is, in practice, unregulated. Intelligence agencies, military forces and police authorities are able to silently, and on mass, and secretly intercept calls and take over computers without the help or knowledge of the telecommunication providers. Usersâ€™ physical location can be tracked if they are carrying a mobile phone, even if it is only on stand by.\"
