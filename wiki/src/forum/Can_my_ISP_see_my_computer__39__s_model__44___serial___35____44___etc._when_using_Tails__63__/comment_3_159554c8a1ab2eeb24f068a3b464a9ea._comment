**Taiwan police arrest man selling smartphone spying software**

Taiwanese authorities have arrested a suspect who offered services and mobile phone applications that allow users to spy on other people's phone conversations, reports our Chinese-language sister paper China Times.

A investigation by Taiwan police found that the **illegal mobile phone application enables users to listen in on phone calls, duplicate text messages, steal call logs and address books, identify the position of phone users through its GPS tracking system and spy on users through the phone's camera.** Online chatting apps such as Line, Skype QQ and Google Talk can also be monitored.

The 36-year-old suspect, Hsu Li-cheng, charged at least NT$33,000 (US$1,137) for the application, which is said to be popular among those who suspect their spouse or partner may be cheating on them.

Once properly installed, the application, **which is said to be compatible with all smartphones**, automatically hides itself and cannot be seen on the phone's interface, making it difficult to detect.

Hsu also allegedly offered his customers password cracking services for around NT$3,000 (US$103) to NT$5,000 (US$172) to break into Facebook, Gmail, Yahoo and other accounts.

Hsu confessed to the police that he originally **purchased the application from China.**

It was revealed from the evidence seized that a man and his mistresses both independently sought Hsu's help to install the application. The mistress had (correctly) suspected the man of cheating on her with a second mistress, while the man suspected his second mistress of having an affair with another man.
