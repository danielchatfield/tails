I found it:

    /usr/local/sbin/do_not_ever_run_me

After a change (why is this script \"never to be run\" by default executable by anyone?):

    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 961 Aug  3 17:39 do_not_ever_run_me

It says

    #!/bin/sh
    #
    # This script fully disables the iptables firewall, and thus the
    # transparent forwarding thru Tor of all non-local network
    # connections... which defeats the whole purpose of this OS, hence
    # this script's name.

    IPT=/sbin/iptables
    IP6T=/sbin/ip6tables

    [ -x \"$IPT\" ]  || exit 67
    [ -x \"$IP6T\" ] || exit 68

    $IPT -P INPUT ACCEPT
    $IPT -P FORWARD ACCEPT
    $IPT -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

    $IPT -t nat -P PREROUTING ACCEPT

    $IPT -t nat -F

    $IPT -X
    $IPT -t nat -X
    $IPT -t mangle -X

    $IP6T -F
    $IP6T -P INPUT ACCEPT
    $IP6T -P FORWARD ACCEPT
    $IP6T -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

    echo \"You might want to unset http_proxy and HTTP_PROXY environment variables as well:\"
    echo \"  unset http_proxy\"
    echo \"  unset HTTP_PROXY\"

Can you explain in more detail why it was neccessary to include this script?  And to make it by default executable by anyone?  How can we test to make sure that it was not somehow activated?  Nmap from another computer on our humble LAN?
