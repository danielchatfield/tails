> Why would Tails' developers want to see what external websites we are visiting? Isn't Tails supposed to provide a high degree of anonymity for its users?

I think you misunderstood the comment.

The comment was simply highlighting two websites that focus on showing you what information your browser tells websites about the machine it is running on, it has nothing to do with the Tails developers wanting to see what websites we visit.
