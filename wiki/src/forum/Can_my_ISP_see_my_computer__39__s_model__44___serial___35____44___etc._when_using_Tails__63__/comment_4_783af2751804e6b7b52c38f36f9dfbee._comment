> When I'm using Tails w Tor, with spoofed MAC address using Macchanger, and i connect to my local ISP, can they still see information about the machine I'm using? Even though the data itself is encrypted. Can they see my machine's manufacturer, real MAC, it's serial number, model number, BIOS version, etc., just due to the login process?

Generally, they can't \"see\" that.

> I've visited webpages that could see the model of my computer, it was surprising.

Reference, please?

> Moreover now that the news is out in the world that there is a vulnerability purposely built into Tails,

Feel free to report such a vulnerability to us. It was already explained at length that the `do_not_ever_run_me` script is not one.

> many state-sponsored programs will target the \"do_not_ever_run_me\" file.

My guess is that clever attackers are much more likely to run
`iptables` commands themselves, instead of relying on this script
to be present and doing what they want.
