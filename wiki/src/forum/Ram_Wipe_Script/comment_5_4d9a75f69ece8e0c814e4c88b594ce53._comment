If you read this thread there already is a lot of usefull links to find how we've done this in Tails. You can also have a look at the [specific design page](/contribute/design/memory_erasure) of this feature to find all relevant informations.

We will try to push this feature upstream in Debian anyway, it just need some small changes for Debian to support it. So if you wait a bit, you should be able to quite just apt-get install it.
