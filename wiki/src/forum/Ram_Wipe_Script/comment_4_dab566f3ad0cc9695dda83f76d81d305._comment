Hello! 

Sorry for my english, im french! ;-)

Im a newbie user and i want to implement that on my debian system, i think its very easy because tails is based on debian! :-)

I search many hours on the web for wipe my ram in a secure way and i find nothing, i had implement my own solution in use sdmem at the end of a script in /etc/rc0.d but i think its not very secure!

Does someone can put the procedures for get that on a debian box please? :-)

Thanks, see you! :-)
