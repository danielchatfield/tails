Althought I don't know fedora, I guess it might be possible to implement our scripts. It mostly rely on a few files :

 * An [[initscript|http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/etc/init.d/tails-kexec;h=05cd98a36984891f1890549230efabcdfc06d4cc;hb=HEAD]] used to start kexec at the end of the shutdown process
 * A [[Hook|http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/sdmem;h=dc34f86d62a9d259ae6d8937f7df56fdb2761062;hb=HEAD]] to initramfs to include sdmem, and a [[script|http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount/sdmem;h=c97510cf544876cb43431cd25d4c187a3c59fad3;hb=HEAD]] to be included in this initramfs. This script is controlled by options defined in a [[Debian /etc/default|http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/etc/default/kexec;h=02fc4c0f0fe5794e2b9faeb0c5688dc2dfeb8a1f;hb=HEAD]] file.

So the process is quite simple. At the end of the shutdown process, the last initscript that is executed is the tails-kexec one, which executes a kexec passing the right options to the \"sdmemed\" initramfs.

The use of this kexec trick is the only we've found to be sure to wipe all the non-kernel ram memory. Otherwise it's quite complicates to know how much userland memory has to be wiped.

If you happen to succeed in implementing this feature into fedora, that'd be nice to explain here how you proceeded, or point to a place were it is explained.
