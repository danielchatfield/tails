Thank you for the quick reply!

I have the files in the right locations now, and have given them chmod +X permisions. How do I tell the kernel to call tails-kexec on shutdown? Right now it just shutsdown with out doing anything. Do I modify the reboot and poweroff scripts to call for it? Or do I modify the runlevel to call for it?
