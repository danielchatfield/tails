1) I boot from TAILS .15 DVD
2) run the TAILS installer
3) \"clone and install\", target a blank USB.

It boots to .15.  Makes sense.

If I choose repeat 1 & 2 then:
3) \"upgrade from ISO\"
4) choose the .16 ISO from HD, target a blank USB.

It succeeds, but does not boot to .16 USB.  

If I do this:
1) Boot to .15 USB
2) Run TAILS installer
3) Choose \"upgrade from ISO\"

...then the target USB is not listed.  The USB is not mounted.  Can I not upgrade 0.15 USB to .16 USB?
