Here the thread starter again.

-I tried all tricks with the mac keyboard/mouse (Both bluetooth devices)
however it looks like it wont even turn on/get detected.

However the problem is solved now and i hope this will help someone else too:

Solutions that did NOT work:
Holding down option key - failed
Holding down mouse button - failed
Tilting the iMac - Failed
Holding down the char \"C\" down - failed

This was the only one that worked:
-Connect an USB keyboard to the iMac
-Turn off your mac 
-When you turn it on, hold down the ALT button with the USB connected keyboard.
If you did this, you will see a black screen most likely for around 15 seconds or less.
The screen will now turn on and you will see with what you want to boot the system up with. You most likely want to turn on you mac os x again, afterards you simply need to eject the DVD/CD and your problem got solved.

I hope this helps someone in the future, still love Tails tho!
