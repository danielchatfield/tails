and now I have to use proxies to pass my traffic. Bridges work only for a few hours because I think my employer sees that I use a bridge or he simply employs some other technique to find that out.

I used Proxies and it worked well,. but proxiers don't stay alove for long and I have to spend many hours to find out some working proxy.

1. Please give me a website where secure, anonymous proxies are updated.

2. Which proxy should I use in Tails? Socks5 or HTTPS (not http) or Socks4.
(I have heard that HTTPS proxy is more secure as it is a combination of Socks+HTTP)

Kindly give me your valuable guidance. I am checking this thread after every 20 minutes because I have a few complaints pending which I need to send to my Head Officer to blow whistle against a fresh scam.
