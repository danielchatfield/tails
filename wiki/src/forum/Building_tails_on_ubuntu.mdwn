I do not have a machine on which it would be convenient to install Debian to bare metal, however I have several Ubuntu machines. I see from this [post](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Tails_Build_Error_on_task_vm:up_-_VM_unable_to_boot___40__VT-X_not_available._VERR__95__VMX__95__NO__95__VMX__41__/
) that it should be possible to build tails on ubuntu.

Virtualbox, rake and vagrant all installed fine, but when I do "git clone..." it complains that three file names are too long. One starting "All_DNS_Traffic..." and two starting "Is_it_possible...". Rake of course blows out on a bunch of errors.

I am running Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit.

Any ideas?

Thanks
