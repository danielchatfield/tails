It seems like it would be an easy way to move files to/from the system. I realize there are risks involved, but any files kept there would either be encrypted on their own (TrueCrypt or 7-Zip) or something I consider non-sensitive. What I'm currently doing is plugging in a second USB drive, but I find that a bit inconvenient for various reasons. 

In any case, I'm very curious to know why this didn't work, just for the sake of understanding Tails better and perhaps avoiding some similar mistake.
