Hi,

I've been looking into this feature for the last month, I have found it complicated (because my need is complicated as well) to get this working. 

I want to dual boot Tails & Mint both in non-persistent mode but have them mount on boot a Home folder located on another USB mass storage device so wifi keys & whatnot don't have to be typed in everytime.

So far I found bits of the puzzle but not all of it. 

Devs is the \"live-rw filesystem\" mentionned on 

http://www.kdenlive.org/user-manual/downloading-and-installing-kdenlive/live-demonstration-dvd-or-usb-storage/full-persisten

applicable to our beloved Tails? If so could I format a microSD card, assign it such name and have tails load the /home from it? 

Thanks!
