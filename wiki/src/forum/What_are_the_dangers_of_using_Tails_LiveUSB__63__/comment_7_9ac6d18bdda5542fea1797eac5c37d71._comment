>At the moment I couldn't find a manufacturer of this type of drives. Do you have any suggestions? Thanks.

Anything of help [here?](http://www.fencepost.net/2010/03/usb-flash-drives-with-hardware-write-protection/)

>Sorry, but what does \"pwn your Tails session\" mean? I'm newbie to internet jargon.

No, my fault! \"[Pwn](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pwn)\" isn't even English! It's a very special term from a very special language called \"[leet](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=l33t)\" - the language of the Script Kiddies..  Often (as here) used with lashings of implicit sarcasm/scorn ;-)

There's a L33t page on wikipedia! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet
