>Are there any malware that operate/exist at the BIOS level such that when I am booting Tails from the USB drive, they infect my USB stick?

\"root kits\" spring to mind. Bear in mind that such software *could* pwn your Tails *session* even if it's impossible to modify your Tails medium. In such an environment you should also consider the threat of *hardware* devices such as keyloggers - this sort of attack is sometimes discovered in public libraries, internet caf√©s, etc
