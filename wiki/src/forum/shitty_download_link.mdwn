why not have some mirrors? 
My download of Tails is performing somewhat less well than I would like. I assume the problem to be at your end.

Tails is over 700MB my dear fellows

My download keeps getting to 25 - 35% and then failing. 

Then it starts again at zero. 

I'm wasting some of my flaky but precious data allocation on a download which keeps failing and doesn't resume. 
Are there are no other servers from which I may download a free copy of Tails? 
I am finding this experience unfortunate and somewhat frustrating.
