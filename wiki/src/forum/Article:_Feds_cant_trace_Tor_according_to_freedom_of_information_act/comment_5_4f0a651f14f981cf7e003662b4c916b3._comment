So tor tells hidden services webmasters they should make their servers secure against hacking, and then tor tells the FBI that hidden services servers are insecure, so the FBI can go ahead and hack them. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

You know, I bet that ever since Anonymous hacked a hidden services child pornography server, all the hidden services webmasters doing something illegal have been busy learning how to secure their servers. Anyone think I'm wrong?
