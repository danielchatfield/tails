>>\"Tor is a layer3 kind of thing, why would anyone think that Tor would do anything at all to protect you from higher level exploits?\"

>So you're saying that Tor is basically useless for protecting your anonymity.

No. Not as I read it. From what I gleaned, (s)he was saying that Tor would do nothing at all to protect you from higher level exploits. 

i.e. If you browse over to Tor to some website and then enter your name and address, credit card number, download and run some code, fall victim to some browser/js/plugin exploit, or whatever, then you could still disclose your identity... despite having connected to said site anonymously.

Not useless at all but hardly some sort of magical anonymity panacea either.
