As I read the article, Reilly said that when the untouchables demand that the Tor Project assist in specific investigations targeting specific servers using \"onion\" addresses (as in \"hidden services\"), Tor says they can't help locate that server or the people who operate it, but that anyone who follows the onion to that server may well find that it has vulnerabilities typical of websites set up by amateurs.

As I read this and similar articles, and other documents complaining about the inability of the FBI (maybe not OGA) to easily unravel Tor chains, the official word the FBI wants to put out these days is that it can't easily subvert Tor, but has enjoyed success in penetrating some \"hidden services\" using mundane non-Tor vulnerabilities.  Since this tends to suggest that the FBI is neither powerless nor all poweful, it might approximate the truth.

I think it is fair to say that all civil liberties organizations (and I think the Tor Project qualifies) are under constant threat of being raided, shut down, or prosecuted by their host governments, and thus must continually pick very carefully when to partially cooperate with authorities and when to try to fight them in the courts.  (Bearing in mind that a court decision going against civil liberties can be more damaging than the original issue at stake.)  Certainly this has been true of long-lived organizations like the ACLU.   Consequently, I would expect that the Tor Project must tread along a dangerous knife-edge ridge with precipitous drop-offs on either side, in which they try to avoid being shoved over the precipice by angry government flunkies, while also doing the best they can to help the ordinary citizen as per their stated mission.

So while it makes me a little sick that Tor \"meets regularly\" with the Untouchables (and also a little sick to think what might be passing through the same Tor nodes I am using to transmit this post!), I suspect that they are doing the best they can to persaude the USG to allow Tor to continue to operate with no worse interference than they already experience.
