from the arstechnica article: 

\"Reilly added that the Tor Project regularly meets with law enforcement agencies to explain to them how Tor works and to point them towards known non-Tor-specific server vulnerabilities.

“Hidden services are just like a street address,” she wrote in an e-mail to Ars on Tuesday. “You can't break an address. You can break the doors or windows of the house at that address. An attack on a .onion and a .com are the same. The usual PHP vulnerabilities to SQL injection and the like are applicable.”

Does this mean that a hacker can crack any hidden services server and get tor users' IP addresses? Or just servers that are not well configured and patched (and how is a tor  user to know which servers are safe and which are not?).

I wish someone with some expertise would comment.
