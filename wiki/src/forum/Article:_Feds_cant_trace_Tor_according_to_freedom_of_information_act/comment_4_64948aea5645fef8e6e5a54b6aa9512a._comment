I can understand why Tor might want to help the FBI fight child pornography. It's morally wrong and its presence is bad for Tor's reputation.  But if you help the FBI hack hidden services child pornography servers, then the government can use this same knowledge to also hack more legitimate hidden services servers. Also, if the child pornography servers keep getting hacked, then likely the people running them will just educate themselves in how to do a better job of securing them.
