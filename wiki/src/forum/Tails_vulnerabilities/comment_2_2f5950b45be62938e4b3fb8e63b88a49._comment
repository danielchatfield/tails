Where does the comparison go wrong exactly?

Thanks for this comparison table. I'd like to see more comparisons of security and privacy of operating systems. The article apparently uses a free licence so it could be moved to a wiki that clearly allows anyone to edit (without the inconvenience and uncertainty of registration, email address, etc).
