Hi everybody.

First i must apologyse for my poor english wich is not my first language.

I am a (happy) TAILS user. For a man who is not good in informatics, it is very usefull.

For the time beeing, Claws must be configured each time i boot from TAILS and the system forgets any program i set up as soon as i logout.

I would like to keep my changes from a connection to the next. Is it possible?

Thanks
