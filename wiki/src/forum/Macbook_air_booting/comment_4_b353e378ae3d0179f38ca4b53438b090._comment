It's not always about well-informed *choice*: many people buy such gear without knowing it is a pain to use with Free Software... and often, *before* knowing about free software at all.

We'll probably won't put that much energy into supporting Apple hardware,
but still, it's something I'd like Tails to support properly,
and I don't like seeing people here reject mac users with useless sarcasm on our forum. If you have nothing helpful to add to the topic, why comment at all?
