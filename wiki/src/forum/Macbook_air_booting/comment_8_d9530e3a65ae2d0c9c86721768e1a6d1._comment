Hey guys i know its a few months in answering but ive been trying for ages to boot from my mba and i think i finally found a way to  boot from it. i started with virtualbox and the tails.iso to install onto a usb then used REfind to boot from usb. heres what i did... open virtual box and click new in the top left corner. click continue and name the file TAILS. choose linux and debian 64 as your system. after doing so allocate 1024 mb to your RAM. Click continue thru the next few screens creating a new hard disk in a virtual desk image ((.vdi) this saves it to your SSD, you can allocate as much GB as you want, up to your max storage). continue with dynamically allocated ( this allows for expansion of the disk space if needed) name file TAILS and click the file on the right to save it to the desktop. once the .vdi is created TAILS should show up on the left hand side in VirtualBox click once to highlight and choose settings on the top left of the window. Choose the display tab and allocate 64 MB to video memory. then choose the storage tab and under ide controller click the CD graphic with the plus sign. in the pop up choose \"choose disk\" and, on your Hard drive select the TAILS.iso that you downloaded from the TAILS website. once TAILS is loaded under ide controller, select the \"empty\" graphic and delete it using the cd with the minus symbol. hit ok and you are able to click start and load TAILS in a virtual machine. after doing so, you are able to use preferences in tails to load to a USB (this drove me crazy for days, if you cant find a usb in your TAILS virtual machine, navigate to disk utility on your macbook air ( you can use spotlight in the top right) and eject the usb drive, while keeping it plugged in. Also, you may have to download the TAILS expansion pack for your TAILS version (found on the website, be sure to choose your version). after doing so, you have a bootable TAILS USB drive that you can now load onto your macbook air, windows bootcamp on macbook, or any windows/linux system. 

hope you find this helpful. i know its a tedious read.
