How can this be done? 

Tor is great for anonymity and much safer than any VPN service, but the IP-addresses of many Tor exit nodes are banned on websites like www.libertyreserve.com. So it is very interesting to know how to use Tor --> socks5 / web-based proxy.

Most of the web-based proxies work with Tor, but unfortunately not with many HTTPS-websites and some scripts etc.

And how to set up your own proxy that can work with Tor and all HTTPS-sites with popular scripts?
