I put a question here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/advtor/forums/forum/942232/topic/5055413
... but I don't know if it will be answered.

Privoxy is supposed to be able to chain another IP address to the Tor exit node. But I haven't found the info yet (is seems to be an \"undesirable\" thing so nobody talks about it).

Here is a public proxy list:
http://hidemyass.com/proxy-list/

Check this:
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/WebBrowsers
\"Circumventing Tor blocks using open HTTP proxies.
Some websites have blocked access from Tor users. Often, however, these websites still allow access from any of millions of open HTTP proxies on the internet. Unfortunately, using an open HTTP proxy directly is not very anonymous.
The solution is to chain an open HTTP proxy between Tor and the unfriendly website. This provides all the anonymity benefits of Tor, while obscuring the fact that you're using Tor from the website.
[...
]One method involves Privoxy. This example config will send all requests through Tor, only chaining an open HTTP proxy after Tor for a select site. Replace 0.0.0.0:80 with the proxy's address and port.
... AND IF YOU FIGURE IT OUT - PLEASE POST A RESPONSE HERE! Thanks.

And maybe:

SEEMS THAT INFO HERE *SHOULD* BE USEFUL - NOW CHECKING
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBOX/OptionalConfigurations
... SEE: Tunneling Proxy/SSH/VPN through Tor
user -> Tor -> Proxy/SSH/VPN

This commercial software claims it is easy to use and can do the chaining (Google this):

... and let me know if you try it.

PLEASE, IF YOU FIGURE IT OUT, POST A REPLY HERE! THANKS!
