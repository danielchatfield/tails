Tails, of all the flavours of Linux, is the one which *least* requires \"anti-virus\":

1. If you're running random code you'll have borked your security/anonymity long ago.


2. If your browser is running random code it'll have borked your security/anonymity long ago.

3. If you're running random binary-blob anti-virus code who can know if you've borked your security/anonymity long ago.

Tails is all about *trustworthy* security achieved through a culture of openness and public scrutiny. All the software is mature/stable (hence the decision to base the code on Debian Stable), open-source (therefore thoroughly examined by, at least, its original development community, its Debian maintainer, the Tails bods, you if you choose, anyone else in the world) and aggressively monitored for security-related updates.

That *start with a bag of crap, shoot it full of holes, then hope some third party app can fix it* mentality belongs to a completely different operating system.
