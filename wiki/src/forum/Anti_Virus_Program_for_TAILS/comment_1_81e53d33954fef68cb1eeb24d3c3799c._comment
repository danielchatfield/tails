What, for scanning a windows volume? Probably better off using a specialised system recovery distro for that sort of thing.

If you think you need that sort of cr*p to mitigate some sort of cavalier manner in which manner in which you use Tails, then you probably have no chance of maintaining any sort of privacy or security and may as well use something more mainstream.
