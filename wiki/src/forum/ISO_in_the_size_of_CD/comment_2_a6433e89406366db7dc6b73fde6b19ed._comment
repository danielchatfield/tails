I would like to be able to burn this onto a 700mb CD as well. Are there older versions available that fit onto a CD? Here's my reasoning:

I'd like to burn an older version to a CD, transfer to a USB stick, then upgrade the USB to the newest version of Tails.

I rarely use CD/DVDs these days. I use USB sticks instead because they are more portable and versatile. But I have a bunch of blank 700mb CDs that I can use up, but no DVDs and I don't feel like going out and buying a stack just to get one to burn and throw away.

Also, in many countries around the globe, especially places where a secure and portable OS is needed the most, people don't have the means to be buying DVDs just to burn one but CDs are still inexpensive.

Anyway, to me it just makes sense to make your OS as accessable to as many people as possible, especially to the people who need it the most.

Thanks.
