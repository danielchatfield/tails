As the distro and its component packages have matured, they have grown. This is quite normal. Tails was kept <CD size for as long as could be done without eroding its usefulness. That time has now passed.

There are evidently some packages which you don't use. Having read the other threads you might have seen that forking Tails is not your only option. *You* could remove those packages which *you* don't use, then re-spin *your own* ISO. How cool is that?! But wait! There's more! The Tails developers have even written [instructions](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/build/) to guide you through the process! OMG!

Still, as you *have* noted, if you don't like Tails, you are always at liberty to [piss off](https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html#index6h1)
