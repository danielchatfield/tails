I would like an anonymous linux distribution that is put on your hard drive, so that I don't have to boot from a CD every time. I now have 2 computers, and I only ever use the second one for TAILS anyway.

If I can't install TAILS, is there a free linux distro that I can install, while expecting

- complete anonymity
- full disk encryption
- Tor + i2p + freenet
- bittorrent

I am willing to do my own installing and whatnot, I'm just having troubles finding a good way to ensure that I am safe.
