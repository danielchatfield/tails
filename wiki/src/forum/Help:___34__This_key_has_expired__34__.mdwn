I am using Microsoft Windows as the primary OS, not Linux or Debian.

After opening a command prompt, I typed the following command:

c:\users\yourusername>gpg --verify c:\users\yourusername\Downloads\tails0.14rc1.iso.pgp c:\users\yourusername\Downloads\tails0.14rc1.iso

The following error message appeared:

This key has expired.

Primary key fingerprint: 0D24 B36A A9A2 A651 7878 7645 1202 821C BE2C D9C1

Could someone from Tails upload a fresh key to the relevant page on the Tails website?
