> Is it considered safe to install \"gthumb\" image viewer to Tails?

AFAIK nobody looked at it seriously enough to answer yes, but I guess it should be,
at least unless you have it do network stuff.

I'm not sure how it's needed to satisfy [[Tails goals|contribute/design]],
but it's probably worth considering.

How about you come discuss this usecase on the
tails-dev mailing-list?
