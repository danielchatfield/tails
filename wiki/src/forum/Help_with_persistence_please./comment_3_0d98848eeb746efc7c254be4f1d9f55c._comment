Thanks for the reply. However, as I mentioned I read the persistence docs & don't understand. I thought the answer might be a custom directory, but didn't understand the example. Please forgive what is probably a stupid question, but does the example mean if you wanted to save images during a tails session you would create a folder called 'images' in the folder /home/amnesia, & then subsequently save the images there?

If that is the case, where might someone who didn't know anything about linux go to learn how to find the location of the monitor & NIC settings? Thanks for your help.
