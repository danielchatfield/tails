I use Ubuntu and my hard disk is the latest generation of non-magnetic.
I thought I'd copy random files (music, videos, photos) and paste everything in my hard disk several times, to occupy the free space until the last megabit, so the hard disk should overwrite the old data with new data random, and it is impossible to recover old files. My reasoning is correct? I believe that this is the best way without installing programs, but I hope in your reply soon...
Next time I'll use tails and I will not have these problems ^^
Thank you a lot!!
