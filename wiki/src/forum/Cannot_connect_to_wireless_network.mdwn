My wireless network is recognized and is displayed in the list of wireless networks (albeit a weak connection, whereas in Windows it is full-strength) however when I attempt to connect to it and enter the password, it either continues asking me for the password repeatedly or accepts the password only to disconnect a few seconds later. Any ideas on a solution?
