depends, obviously.

Data files can't tell the opening application to bypass Tor using permitted functionality. They can only tell it to make outbound connections through Tor that can't _directly_ leak your IP address.

If a File can exploit a vulnerable application on Tails (you don't even necessarily have to open the file, e.g. Nautilus/Filemanager thumbnailer) it can bypass Tor and leak your IP as well as other compromising data.

The first scenario is very likely when using PDFs and Adobe Reader (or wmv and WMP, other proprietary software...) I would be very surprised if Evince or Open Office allow, by design, silent network connections on behalf of untrusted files.

The second is rare for public files available on  the open internet. They happen frequently in targeted attacks, \"APT\", \"spear phishing\". If your threat model includes such advanced (well, we can argue about that) and targeted attacks you are asking the wrong questions. In this case you shouldn't use Tails in its current form at all. You don't need to open files to become exploited and have your IP exposed. All it takes is browsing the \"right\" website that exploits the bundled Firefox. Unless Firefox gets more frequent security updates in Tails and Tails incorporates sandboxing/MAC/privilege isolation as well as more advances hardening features this will remain so.
