wmv?  Citation please?

The only known exploits using .wmv files as far as I recall use malware plus a social engineering attack.  When the .wmv video file is opened on Windows it takes the user/sucker to a webpage where malware installs.  I don't know if that could work with linux media players or not.  Moral: any non-html file that tries to open a website is suspect.
