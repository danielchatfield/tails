Ok hi, now i know that DOC and PDF files are able to phone home. Im no expert, so i have a few questions regarding Tor/Tails safety:

1. Like Comment 2 and 3 mentioned, WMVs are able to phone home too? How does this work and can they phone home too when they are opened by other media players like the VLC Player.
2. Which files (extensions) you know of are able to phone home too, beside those mentioned above? 
3. Is it safe to download via Tor or does it bypass and reveal the IP? Is it safe to save Pictures via Tor without revealing the IP or them phoning home?

It would be nice if someone would try to answer them all. Thank you alot in advance.
