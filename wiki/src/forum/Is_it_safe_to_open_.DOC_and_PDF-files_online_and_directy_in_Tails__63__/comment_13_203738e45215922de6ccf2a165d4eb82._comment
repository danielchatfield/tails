indeed I was referring to that page.

Because i did not preview the formatting of my comment, what was meant to be separated ended up as one long run on sentence. I did in fact read that Tails is listed as a solution; however, i became unsure upon reading many of the comments on this thread, which seemed to be contradictory.

 of course, with my relative beginner`s computer knowledge; it is possible I misunderstood.

thanks for clarifying
