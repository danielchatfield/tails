I think that the first comment response was not entirely helpful, and the second comment was from a more extreme perspective (though AFAIK the points made *are* valid nonetheless).

I'm not much of a veteran either and sorry for being short with you - in retrospect this thread is not very clear at all so you were right to follow with the further questions and research.


tl;dr:

three things to retain - 

1. Some files can phone home and can download nasties on your computer once opened.
2. Tails should pass everything through TOR so you should still be anonymous when this happens.
3. Assuming no persistence is used, Tails amnesic (live) properties should give you a clean slate after rebooting which should remove traces of said nasties.

So you should be careful - For the dodgiest files you will want to disconnecct the networking, avoid persistence and any personal accounts and reboot as soon as possible. Ideally you would boot into tails just to open the file before rebooting again.

for just slightly dubious files or if you're not particulary worried, you should not expect your anonymity to be compromized as long as you do not open the files after having been logged into any internet accounts or as long as you have little to no persistence enabled.
