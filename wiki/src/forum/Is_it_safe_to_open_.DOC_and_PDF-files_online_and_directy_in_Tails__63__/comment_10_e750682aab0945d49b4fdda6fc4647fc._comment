I am confused.
On the Tor homepage it says:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING. You should be very careful when downloading documents via Tor (especially DOC and PDF files) as these documents can contain Internet 
resources that will be downloaded outside of Tor by the application that opens them. This will reveal your non-Tor IP address. If you must work with DOC and/or PDF files, we strongly recommend either using a disconnected computer, downloading the free VirtualBox and using it with a virtual machine image with networking disabled, or using Tails. Under no circumstances is it safe to use BitTorrent and Tor together, however.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
It seems to state that using Tails allows you to safely veiw PDF and DOC files
yet here it is said that working with PDF and DOC files is unsafe even within tails
so which is correct? or do I misunderstand?
If someone would offer clarification I would be grateful
i would be grateful if someone would clarify
