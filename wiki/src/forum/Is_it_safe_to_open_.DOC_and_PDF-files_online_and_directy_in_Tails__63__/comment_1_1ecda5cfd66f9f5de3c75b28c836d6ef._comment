>Is it safe to open .DOC and PDF-files online and directy in Tails? 

No, it is not. 

PDF, DOC and other files can have certain elements within them that \"phone home\" and can compromise your anonymity and security.

Therefore, such files should merely be *saved* while connected and then opened only after disconnecting. 

Also, if there is any doubt as to the authenticity or integrity of any file, it should be first opened (and perhaps scanned and/or examined) in a NON-networked *live* or *virtual* environment. 

Running TAILS, you can simply do the following:

1.) Completely disconnect from the Internet and any other network (probably best to actually physically remove the network cable, if at all possible)

2.) (only after following step one above) Examine/scan/open the files in question.

3.) Make sure the files are saved to an actual medium from where you can later retrieve them (not merely from the TAILS RAM file system (ramfs), which will disappear after you shut down)

REMEMBER: Whether with TAILS or any other live OS, once any file of questionable integrity has actually been opened or executed (or, for that matter, you have visited a site or otherwise exposed yourself to a high-risk environment), it is essential to completely shut down before doing anything further that could make you vulnerable (e.g., logging into an account, connecting a drive with personal files, etc.)
