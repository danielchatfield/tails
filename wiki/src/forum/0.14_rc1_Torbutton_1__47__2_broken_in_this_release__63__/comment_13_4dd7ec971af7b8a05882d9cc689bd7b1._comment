\"Ignore comment 9 and don't waste your time reading the links as he is just being a fucking dumb-ass idiot.

It still doesn't explain to the non technical or window newbies that have come here from browser bundle if they have been anonymous or not with broken Torbutton.\"

Took the words out of my mouth. I read some of that. waste of time, learned nothing about this. Two obvious sorts here - ones who just want to use some software for a purpose, others who cum (PI) to w*nk off telling others to research (\"like I did\") and won't answer a damn question when they know the answer.

Site says 0.14 isn't fundamentally broken,  and since 0.13 has old Tor (quote 'it's the right thing to do' -upgrading Tor) then it's reasonable to think 14 might be at least as anonymous as 13. An answer please! 

What about running latest Tor browser Bundle (for anonymity) within Tails (for privacy)- say copying TBB from flash drive into incognito desktop and running from there. Does that work? Is it trivial to do?

sometimes I think this whole Tails site is a practical joke.
