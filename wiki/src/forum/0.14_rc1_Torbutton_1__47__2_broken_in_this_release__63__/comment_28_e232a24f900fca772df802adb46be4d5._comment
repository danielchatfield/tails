So if your car manufacture announced that something was broken with your model wouldn't you expect them to tell you in plain simple English what is broken and how it may affect you?

Or would you expect some silly fucker to avoid the issue with some vague announcement and give you a link to the service manual for the car as if that is any sort of fucking help?
