Sorry, but I am still going you to suggest some reading material: [Torbutton design documentation](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/index.html.en). Mike Perry did an exhaustive analysis of the various threats that are facing a browser, against a pretty sound threat model.

This should help you understand to which extent the anonymity of Tails users which are browsing the web can be threaten.

The traffic has been torrified since the very first version of Tails. All of this is not about Tor, it is about more subtle ways to reduce the user anonymity set.
