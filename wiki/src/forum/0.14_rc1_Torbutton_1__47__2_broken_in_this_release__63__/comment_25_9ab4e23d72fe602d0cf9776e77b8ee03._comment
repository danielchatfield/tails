> Anonymity is not a binary property. Before 0.14-rc2, there are several ways Tails browser can be fingerprinted.

First off all, I DID READ the mailing list discussion/etc so please don't tell me to read the manual or whatever.

What does fingerprinting mean? Fingerprinting as in browser fingerprinting, i.e., websites know what browser and/or OS you are running? 

Also, what are the implications of running a partial working torbutton? From an anonymity point of view?
