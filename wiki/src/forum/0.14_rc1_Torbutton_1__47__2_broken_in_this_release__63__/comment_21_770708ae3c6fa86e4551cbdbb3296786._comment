 * 0.13 : Iceweasel 10.0.7 without TorBrowser patches + mostly working Torbutton
 * 0.14-rc1 : Iceweasel 10.0.7 witout TorBrowser patches + mostly working Torbutton
 * 0.14-rc2 : Iceweasel 10.0.9 with TorBrowser patches + working Torbutton

Is that the answer people wants?

Anonymity is not a binary property. Before 0.14-rc2, there are several ways Tails browser can be fingerprinted. After 0.14-rc2, some of them do not work anywore, but there are still many ways of doing so.

What was never released with Tails is Iceweasel 10.0.8 without TorBrowser patches + Torbutton. Which has more fingerprinting issues than what we had before.
