Reading this forum, and bearing in mind the point of Tails and Tor, it seems to me people are particularly concerned about people discovering their IP address, or even that their IP address is using Tor.

I was wondering whether there would be any value in using Pay as you go mobile broadband (using a dongle, not a cell) for activities requiring Tor? In the unlikely event that your IP address could be established, would this not make it near impossible to trace the user?

If you were really paranoid, perhaps you could change your dongle sim every month or so, so then even if the location were traced, by the time they get there, or even to you, no evidence would exist of your ever having used that IP address?

Just a thought.
