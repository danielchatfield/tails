I found a lot of nice options for Icedove that fixes all things that we've done for claws. I just updated this page: https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO/EMail#ExperimentalSuggestionsforpossiblymakingthunderbirdandorclawsstopleakinginfoExperimental

Will open a todo item about whether we want Icedove back.
