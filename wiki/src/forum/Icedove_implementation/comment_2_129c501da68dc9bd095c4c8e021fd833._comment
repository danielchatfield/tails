Claws Mail wasn't particularly configured to be torified. It's handled by the whole-system transparent torification, see [[the design documentation|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement]].

We replaced Icedove with Claws Mail at some point since the former was a pain to properly configure for anonymity. When a proper Torbutton exists for Icedove, we might thing about it again.
