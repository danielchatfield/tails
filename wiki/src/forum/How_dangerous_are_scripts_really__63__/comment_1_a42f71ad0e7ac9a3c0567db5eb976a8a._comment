My 2 pennies :D

Many websites have \"helper\" plugins to \"enhance\" website environment. Think of for example Flash, or Java.

To cut a few corners, they are tiny little applications which can be asked to give certain information about the visiting user. Some are innocent, like \"tell me your screen resolution\". Others can be more annoying like \"tell me where you are located\".

If it's \"dangerous\" or not depends on your environment. Say you are a student who wants to bypass a firewall. What's the worst that can happen? Revocation of internet privileges? A slap on the wrist by the dean?

Suppose you are a employee of \"big corp X\". Now it might get more hairy, like losing your job.

What for example if you live in \"evil country X\", and some guys come knocking on your door, than kicking the shit out of you? I bet you will be much more cautious.

As far as I know, Tails should block enough of those \"helper apps\" functionality to give you a fair chance. It's entire your responsibility to disable it or not.

Google analytic combines aggressive scripting with a vast database, making the risk of exposing yourself high. Google wants to make profit, and wants to know as much about the user as possible. User data is a gold mine for - say - advertisement.
