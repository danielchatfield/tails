Please don't confuse JavaScript and Java.

AFAIK JavaScript alone is not enough to obtain an ip address (of your Tails endnde). JavaScript has to \"call\" a server side script written in - for example - Java.

Before disabling Tails blocking features it might be wise to know exactly what websites you are visiting to prevent exposing your real life ip address.
