Can Javascript unmask the real IP then? Or does the enemy have to catch you live when visiting a website and reveil your real IP with some scripts?

I mean when using Gmail for example, there are a lot of active scripts. What has Tails more besides NoScript to protect the original IP?

When anonymity is really important, is it better to always disable Java-script and ssl-analytics? In that case is it better not to use Gmail anymore..
