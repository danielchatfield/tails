Problem:
- Tails USB Installer fails to clone & install on USB
- Claims not enough space is available
- Creates a partition of 1497MB, leaving the rest as unallocated space

Extra information:
- I have tried on 4 different USBs all 4GB-8GB
- Have tried formatting (not quick format) in FAT, FAT32 and RAW before trying Tails USB Installer
- This problem was encountered while running Tails version 0.12.1
