On the homepage of this website there are links to a few other OS projects that also seem to offer privacy and security. As a novice I can’t tell the difference between Tails, Ubuntu Privacy Remix, Privatix, and Liberté Linux. I want privacy and security and all say they offer it, so which one should I go with and why? Are some less secure than others, or more novice friendly than others?

Thanks for any help :D
