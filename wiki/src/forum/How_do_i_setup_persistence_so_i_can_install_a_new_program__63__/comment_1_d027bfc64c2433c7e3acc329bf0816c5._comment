It's not possible at the moment.

What yo can do is: select \"APT lists\" and \"APT cache\" in the persistence wizard, so the downloaded package remains in the persistent storage and you can re-install it right after you boot Tails.

Proper support for persistent user-installed programs is being implemented, check the tails-dev mailing list if you're curious
