Building from source is an impossible task for me. I checked out customize tails page & debian manual, but it went over my head. :( Was hoping if there was way to make customized tails ISO while running from Live Tails. I really dont want many of the stuff provided like gimp, inkscape, etc and would like to have VLC. That would also reduce the size and will then fit in a CD.
