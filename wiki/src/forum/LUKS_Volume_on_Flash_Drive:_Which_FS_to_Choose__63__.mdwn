Using Palimpsest (Gnome `Disk Utlity`), I want to create one or more LUKS volumes on a USB *flash* stick for personal data (that I will be able to access and modify easily while running TAILS). (This will be a completely separate stick than the one I run TAILS from.)

What I need to know is which file system to choose to format the drive in. I have searched quite a bit for this info but cannot find any clear answer. 

I see that `Disk Utility` defaults to `ext4` but is this best for *flash* or *SSD* media? 

Would choosing the non-journaling `ext2` extend the life of flash media due to less writes? 

On the other hand, not journaling means less protection against data loss, doesn't it?

Thanks for any info.
