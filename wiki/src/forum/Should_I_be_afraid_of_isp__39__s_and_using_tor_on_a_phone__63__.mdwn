Can someone please tell me? I'm weary of thinking about this stuff (that's why I'm driven to use tor). I've tried researching this stuff before on wiki and I remember it not making sense to me and I'm afraid to keep typing stuff out in the open. 

Basically, I'm paranoid of using tor anywhere but a public place being paranoid about isp's not knowing what they do and how the internet works. Having said that I'm wondering if I use my phone to use tor and maybe tether the connection or something to get internet on my computer (never did it before but thinking about going that route), but would that be private or whatever? Do isp's care and is there anything to even worry about? What are isp's anyways? I don't know about that stuff but I worry about it just feeling in the dark and afraid to move or do anything. Can someone shine some light for me on whether this is ok or not?
