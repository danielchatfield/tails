> A popup appeared that Tails 0.11 is not secure anymore. But i didn't see the onion icon. It took a while until it appeared, and it was then yellow. A little bit after it went green and iceweasel loaded the tor-check.

The onion icon is used by Vidalia, which is a GUI controller for Tor. Tor itself is started in the background, completely independently from Vidalia and always before. Hence it's entirely possible that the update checker completes even before Vidalia has started, even though the update checker is run through Tor.
