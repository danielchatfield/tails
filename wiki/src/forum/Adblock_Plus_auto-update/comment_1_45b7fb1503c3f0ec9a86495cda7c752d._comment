> Adblock Plus auto-update
> Is this OK?

In Tails 0.10 and earlier, a huge
`extensions.adblockplus.synchronizationinterval` was set to avoid
auto-updates from happening.

> Do we need auto-updates for Adblock Plus filters?

Did you see such auto-updates happen?

> The config: https://adblockplus.org/en/preferences#subscriptions_autoupdate

This option appeared in Adblock Plus 2.0.3, that was not ready in time
for Tails 0.10. Tails 0.10.1 ships it, and replaces our old
`synchronizationinterval` tweaks by using this new setting.
