I am using Tails in Vm Virtual Box
on windows 7 home premium x64

Loaded it in VM Virtual Box.

Its using Iceweasel Browser


Is it already set up to the max secure or
should you add something additionally ?


It said using it in a Virtual Box is "dangerous"
becuase the other Os could be monitouring it

How to solve this problem if even necessary ?
