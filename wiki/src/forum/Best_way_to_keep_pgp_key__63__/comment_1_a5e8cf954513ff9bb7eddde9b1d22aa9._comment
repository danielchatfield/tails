> I am aware that Tails doesn't keep any files after a reboot and this is intended. However I need to keep my pgp key and a few text based files, obviousley these need to be kept securely. So what method would you recommend?

This is documented: [[doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]]

However, we're currently working hard on getting [[todo/persistence]] done, which will allow you to save your GPG keyring (among other practical things) to a second, encrypted partition on the same USB drive you have installed Tails to.
