To pick up a point made in another recent thread in this forum:

Tails is based on Debian Stable, one of the more stable and secure distributions of open source software using the Gnu/Linux operating system.

The Debian Project has a different \"philosophy\" from some other software providers: avoid the ragged bleeding edge in favor of promptly providing security updates for older versions which may lack certain \"user friendly\" features but which are also better tested for stability and security.  Debian implements this philosphy using its package management system, which allows users to painlessly avoid dependency issues and to easily obtain the latest security patches (to an \"old version\"; compare installing \"the newest version\").

From this point of view, using a 3.2 kernel instead of the very latest kernel is wise and helps to keep us safe.  Or at least, *safer*
