Sorry, please read \"a virus\" as *malware*: I didn't mean to imply it might be a virus specifically, rather than any of the other forms of malware which routinely afflict people who use Microsoft Windows. Viruses, trojans, worms, root-kits, etc. are all rife and all known to interfere with the victims' internet connections in an effort to hinder their detection/removal.
