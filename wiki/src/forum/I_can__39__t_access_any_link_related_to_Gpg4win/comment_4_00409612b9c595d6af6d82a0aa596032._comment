Perhaps you are using Microsoft Windows and a virus is blocking connections to an arbitrary list of security-related domains. You could try downloading one of the other GnuPG front-ends from the list they recommend on their gnupg.org site... but... given the suspicious nature of your predicament, I'd *very strongly advise* using another (more trustworthy) computer and/or OS to verify and burn your Tails ISO.
