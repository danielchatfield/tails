Any advice for the best method on how to instal Amnesia to USB (and I would need to be pointed in the direction of a walk-thru to accomplish this -read: basic linux knowledge). I am not looking for persistance just faster boot up and response times than my CD drive can give me. 

I have installed the Debian Live Magic package, but reading the documentation with this it looked (initially at least) like it will only install/create a Debian live image.
