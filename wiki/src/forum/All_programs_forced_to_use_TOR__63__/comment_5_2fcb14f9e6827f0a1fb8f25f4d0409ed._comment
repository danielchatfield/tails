> Is it possible for an attacker to exploit the fact that tails has an unsafe browser into revealing their identity, when the person is not using the unsafe browser? 

It is possible for an attacker that has already gained root credentials.
But one such attacker has easier ways to de-anonymize the Tails user then,
so I certainly would not call this to \"exploit the fact that tails has an unsafe browser\".
