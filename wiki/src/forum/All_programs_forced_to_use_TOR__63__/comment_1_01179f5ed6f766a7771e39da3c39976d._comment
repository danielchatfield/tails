> In tails, if you install a new program, is it then automatically forced to use connections through TOR?

Yes it is. all programs (with the exception of I2P and the unsafe web browser) is forced to go through TOR. 

Tails is also set up so that all non TOR connections (with the exception of connections from I2P and the unsafe web browser) is blocked, so if for some reason a program can't be configured to use TOR then it simply won't be able to connect to the net.

At no point will Tails allow any program (with the exception of I2P and the unsafe web browser) to connect to the web without TOR, no matter how you installed said program.
