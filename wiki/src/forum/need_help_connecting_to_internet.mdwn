hi,

i used to be able to get tails running, on my own internet connection (both wireless and with a cable) situations have changed now, and i bought a new computer, and have no internet at home no more.
So now i working with a new machine in coffeeshops.
Sadly, i can't get tails working, or better, i cant connect to the internet using tor.

tried 2 times, first time the vidalia log gave me warnings about a problem bootstrapping, it got stuck at 10%
in the end it said tor was not running
the second time i got an 'error: Reading config failed -- see warnings above'
warnings were about /var/run/tor not owned by this user.
anybody andy ideas as how to fix this?

help would be appreciated
