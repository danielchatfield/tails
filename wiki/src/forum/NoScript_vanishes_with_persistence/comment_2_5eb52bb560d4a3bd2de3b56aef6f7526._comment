Actually both TorButton and NoScript icons vanished from Iceweazel's navigation toolbar, however I was able to get these back manually using View->Toolbars->Customize. dragging the icons to the toolbar and re-starting Iceweazel. 

But I would like to understand why the icons went away and if what I am doing is ok or not.
