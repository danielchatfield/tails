Quoting the [[persistence design document|contribute/design/persistence]] :

> Stuff we don't want to actively support making persistent:
>
> web browser addons (while we don't want to make it impossible to install addons, we think it's a really bad idea, and won't actively support it, since it partitions the Tails users anonymity set, thus having bad consequences both on people who do it and on others)

But you are free to shoot yourself in the footâ€¦ Don't expect any support though.
