> Why don't you submit the testing release announcement(s) to Distrowatch like some other distros do, to widen the testing base? 

I personally think that people interested in Tails enough to test release candidates are more likely to follow Tails announcement channels than distrowatch, but YMMV.

Anyway, I'd be happy if someone commited to send these announcements to distrowatch. This someone could be you :)
