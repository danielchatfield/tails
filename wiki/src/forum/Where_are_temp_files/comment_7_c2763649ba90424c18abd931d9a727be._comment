>temporary files are mainly written in /tmp, /var/run and /var/tmp. and somewhere in your account folder (here: /home/amnesia), depending on the application and its settings.

log files are written in /var/log.>

How can I delete the logs and the temp files there? How can I stop the process of logging and creating temp files ?
