> Have I understood the documentation correctly that Tails should set the system time to UTC?

Sorry, should have answered this one too:

Yes. When Tails is syncing the system clock it is setting it to the current time in UTC. All modern operating systems should.

Tails is also displaying the time in UTC (current system clock time without any +/- hours). Other operating systems you have may display it in your local timezone (by adding the right amount of hours to the time your system clock is set).
