It seems so. Thanks for investigating it.

I'd like to make it very clear we do *not* support Tails
installed with (and sometimes transparently modified by, as you just
did experience) methods that are not documented on this very web site.

Great.

Personally, I don't care at all. They probably see the timezone
mangling as a nice feature, which is probably right for less
specialized systems than Tails.

Yes. See [[download]].
