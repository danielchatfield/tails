That would indeed be a bug. Possibly some of the websites in our htpdate pool report non-UTC times, but for a 40% failure rate that would be too many so that I'm skeptical that's the reason. Please try reproducing this (by repeatedly rebooting Tails) and file a [[proper bug report|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] including the contents of `/var/log/htpdate.log` when you hit the bug.
