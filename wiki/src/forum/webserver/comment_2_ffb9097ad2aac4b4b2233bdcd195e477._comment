very nice. Youtube starts censoring the realtime views and with this, they start also manipulating the ranking list. Thats a sign something really bad is going on. I hope the Server Release will be a good alternative for videobroadcast like Youtube is, but not in a centralised way. A Videobroadcast Network like emule or torrents are working with a webplatform, simular to Youtube.
