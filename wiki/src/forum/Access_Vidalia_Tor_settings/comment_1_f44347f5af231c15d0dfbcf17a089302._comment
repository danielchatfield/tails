Just in case you didn't try \"the obvious\":

Assuming you are currently running Tails, do you see a green onion icon in your task bar?

If you right click on it, you should see a pulldown menu, with one choice being \"Settings\".  Clicking on that should create a new window where you can access the settings.  I believe there is a long-known bug which prevents users from modifying their torrc this way.
