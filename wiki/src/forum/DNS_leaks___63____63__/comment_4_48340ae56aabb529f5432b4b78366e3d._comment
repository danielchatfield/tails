Hmmmm... I see.

I wouldn't worry about that! Quoting a cautionary warning out of context like that, from another project's documentation, with the aim of scoring cheap marketing \"wins\" for your own project, is at best, disingenuous and very poor form. It's not as if they're presenting ***any*** original research, or even claiming to have conducted any!

Yes, there will ***of course*** be ways the user can misconfigure or misuse Tails with the result of damaging it's effectiveness. Any ***reputable*** project will seek to alert alert its users to this. The same is doubtless true of Whonix's offering... there will be countless misconfigurations and exploits which can weaken their approach. Malware/rootkits on host, recently discovered failings in Intel's VT-x implementation, blah, blah, blah... plenty of possibilities spring to mind on the spot! ***As with Tails***, most of Wonix's weaknesses will remain \"unknown\" until such time as an exhaustive code audit and analysis has been completed (i.e. never).

So it would appear that the Whonix project has chosen to present transparency and disclosure as weakness while brushing the same concerns about their own code under the carpet. I don't think this proves \"Tails has DNS leaks while Whonix has full protection (whatever that's meant to mean)\" at all. If anything, all it proves to me is that Tails is more open/honest/trustworthy than Whonix.

You, of course, are free to interpret their marketing crap however you please ;)
