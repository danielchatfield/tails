> Is tails tested against DNS leaks?

Tails is indeed [[tested against DNS leaks|contribute/release_process/test#index5h1]] (the actual test checks whether all network traffic is routed through Tor, which implies no DNS leaks). For more information about what Tails does w.r.t. DNS, see the [[DNS section of the Tor enforcement design|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/DNS]].
