**Security**
                                        Whonix          Tails           TBB

IP/DNS protocol leak protection 	Full ^1^ 	Depends ^5^ 	Depends ^5^

^5^ See first example of Whonix security in real world. When applications in Tails are configured wrong, due to a bug in Tails or the application, IP can leak. Quoted from the Tails Security Page: \"Until an audit of the bundled network applications is done, information leakages at the protocol level should be considered as − at the very least − possible.\"
