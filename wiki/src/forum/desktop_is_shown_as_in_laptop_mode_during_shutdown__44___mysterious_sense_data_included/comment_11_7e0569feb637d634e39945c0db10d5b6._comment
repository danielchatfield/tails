I think \"cointelpro\" is a bit of a stretch! It would seem to me that the commentators around here have a sense of humour! Made me laugh aloud. :D

(wasn't me - before I'm accused of laughing at my own jokes)

Anyway, re. your(?) OP...

>why is my desktop being shown as in laptop mode when I shutdown?

**probably** some scheduling or power-saving profile but if you don't give the *precise* message you can never receive an definitive answer.

>there's also some myserious \"SENSE\" or \"sense\" data shown, much like would be shown within a binary. 

What is \"mysterious(?)\" about it? What *precisely* is the message you refer to? 

>The shutdown screen quits after wiping so I don't have a chance to catch the information to write it down unless I take a photograph of the screen with a camera. 

Sounds like a plan.

A VM could grab you a capture too.

>What is this info...

We don't know - you haven't told us yet!

>why is my desktop being put into laptop mode?

See above.

BTW. If you're concerned you've uncovered a conspiracy, it's not a very good one if it's advertising itself to the victim every shutdown.
