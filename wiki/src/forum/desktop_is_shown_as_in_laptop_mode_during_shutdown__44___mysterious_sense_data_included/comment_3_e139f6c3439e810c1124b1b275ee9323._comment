this problem continues, here are the errors from CTRL/ALT/F1 display:

>localhost laptop-mode: Warning: Configuration file /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/board-specific/*.conf is not readable, skipping.

>localhost laptop-mode: Laptop mode

>localhost laptop-mode: enabled, not active

Why is it enabling laptop mode (and failing) for a desktop!?
