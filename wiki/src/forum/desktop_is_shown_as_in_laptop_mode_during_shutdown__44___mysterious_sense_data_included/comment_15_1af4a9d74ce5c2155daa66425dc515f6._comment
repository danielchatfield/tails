I still don't see any *real* problem that should be solved, so IMHO this is very, very low priority considering the [[tasks we already feel commited to complete|todo]].

Telling people what they *should* do, without any explanation, is certainly not how things work here. Please make the reasons clear behind these *should* of you, and maybe even [[contribute a patch|contribute/how/code]], or find someone who will, if it's that important to you.
