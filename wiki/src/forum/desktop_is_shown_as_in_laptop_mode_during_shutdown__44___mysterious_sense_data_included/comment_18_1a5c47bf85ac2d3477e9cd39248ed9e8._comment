\"more trolling off replies. useless.\"

Indeed. A lot of the OPs here are trolled and told to visit a bug page which won't receive as many views as these pages will, follow a mailing list with few people reading and posting to it, or insulted.

If I didn't know better I would swear all of these elusive answers would point to a conspiracy - that this distro is not to be trusted.
