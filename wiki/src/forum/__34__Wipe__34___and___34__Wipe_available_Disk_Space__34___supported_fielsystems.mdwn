Hello,

I do appreciate the feature "Wipe" and "Wipe available Disk Space" supported fielsystems very much! 

One should expect that Linux-filesystems e.g. ext3fs and ext4fs are supported.


Question:
Are FAT and NTFS supported as well?



PS
I don't have any Windows installation to test this myself :-(


Thank you very much for any feedback!

Bill
