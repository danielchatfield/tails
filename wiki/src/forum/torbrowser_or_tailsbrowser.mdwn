torbrowser or tailsbrowser? torbrowser is based on firefox, tailsbrowser on iceweasel which is unbranded. what's the difference? is tor browser better?

tailsbrowser has torbutton....

what about the the torbrowser firefox patches? https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#firefox-patches are they too insignificant? tailsbrwoser has them? tailsbrowser does not need them?
