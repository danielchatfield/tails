When I set the location in the clock/location settings, I notice the following errors in .xsession-errors:

(gnome-panel:####): GWeather-WARNING **: Failed to get METAR data: 504 Connect to weather.noaa.gov:80 failed: Connection refused.

When I try to remove GWeather from the system, it throws up several important dependencies so I cancel the removal of GWeather.

When I rename the libgweather.so* files to something else it breaks the libclock-applet.

I don't want my system trying to fetch weather information, especially not from a government site.

Is there an easy way to get rid of GWeather without breaking my system?
