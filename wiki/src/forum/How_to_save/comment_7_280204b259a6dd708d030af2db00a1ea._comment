no I mean resolution . I have already found how to save theam and glad to see it each time i boot) May be I have rare display but neither windows nor ubuntu can't automaticaly choose correct resolution . So nothing strange that Tails doesn't doing the same. But on ubuntu I can change it one time and forget about it.
