Assuming you don't mean resolution - which should be automatic...

There's nothing wrong with saving configuration info. My startup script installs a custom theme Every time I boot into Tails... is that the sort of thing you mean?

Please list precisely which settings you'd like to persist and we'll be able to tell you which files/folders you'll need to save/restore.
