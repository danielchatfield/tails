You should avoid saving sensitive material on disk at all, particularly if you are not using Linux as your primary OS.  This is particularly true in locales where using Tor is illegal (or may be about to quietly become illegal).

Don't worry, there is an alternative which is workable if not exactly convenient.  Just create an encrypted USB stick following the directions in the documentation:

Even if you cannot boot from a bootable USB stick you can almost certainly read and write from an encrypted volume on a USB stick.
