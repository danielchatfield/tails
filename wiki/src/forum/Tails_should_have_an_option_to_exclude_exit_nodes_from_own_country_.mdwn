I really love Tails! It's the best OS for privacy!

Only a suggestion for a next release:

Please build in an option to exclude exit nodes from specific countries. I think it's much safer to exclude exit nodes from your own country. Especially in smaller countries where are few Tor-users, it can be dangerous to use exit nodes from your own country.

In the Tor Browser bundle it is possible to use for example: ExcludeNodes {us}. But in Tails it does't work. Please fix this next time, if possible. Thank you!
