My goal was to configure my usb to allow for a general partition windows and linux could use, as well as a tails install with persistance.

Here is how I achieved it;
1) Boot tails cd and install to your USB using the full clone install tool.
2) Create the general partition after the tails partiton for windows to use.
3) Boot into tails USB, setting an admin password and configure persistance, it will take up the remainder of the room on the USB.

4) Now for the switcheroo because windows can only see the first partition on removable media *GRR*, be carefull here.

    sudo gdisk /dev/sdb
    x
    t
    1
    2
    w

This will transpose the first and second entries, so windows sees the correct one. Have fun :)
