I am annoyed by same same people keeping on asking for a general privacy forum.

stackoverflow has a whole network for answer centric fora. [check it out](https://stackexchange.com/sites)

you can [request](http://area51.stackexchange.com/) your own.

Do you want a debate like forum more?

What requirements do you have?

Why don't you do it or are you just waiting for others to do it for you?

Alternative: The [cleaned wiki](http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page) has a [list](http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page#Web_Hosting) of free onion hosting.

For the lazy ones [Onionforum 2.0](http://65bgvta7yos3sce5.onion/) or [hack bb](65bgvta7yos3sce5.onion) has also a privacy and general forum where you can debate anything without account. [List of ONion Fora](http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page#Forums_.2F_Boards)
