Hello, 
I have one question regarding hidden services and namecoin. Perhaps it is not the most apropriate place to ask but since tor doesn't have a forum i'll do it here.
Thing is: Could I set up a hidden service, and then use namecoin to secure a dns and point it to my hidden service through tor2web? Would this permit anonymous and convinient blogging, or is it just not possible?
