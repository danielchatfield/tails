I just tried downloadhelper with Tails and it didn't seem to work since Tails
doesn't support Flash yet, see [[todo/Flash_support]].

But another Firefox plugin has been reported to work within Tails, see
[[todo/easy_youtube_downloader_plugin]] even though no evaluation of the
security of the plugin has been attempted. So use it at your own risk.

Installing extra Firefox extensions is always a risk because they could
interfere with the extensions that are already shipped and carefully configured
in Tails and break from within Firefox some of those security measures.
