> I hope that in future the Tails Project won't take any more money from such questionable sources as NDI, or if you do, that you clearly state on your website that you have told them not to expect special favors to the USG.

I believe our [[about page|about]] and [[design goals|contribute/design]] suggest quite clearly that Tails is not about doing \"special favors\" to this or that government, but is about *preserving your privacy and anonymity*. So, I don't really understand why we should make this even more explicit. Sometimes, writing more does not help being clearly understandood.
