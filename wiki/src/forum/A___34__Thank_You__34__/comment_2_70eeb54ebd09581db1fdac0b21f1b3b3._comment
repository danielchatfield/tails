Second that!  

I hope that in future the Tails Project won't take any more money from such questionable sources as NDI, or if you do, that you clearly state on your website that you have told them not to expect special favors to the USG.  Many among the core userbase for a tool like Tails would like to express criticism of US foreign policies, and NDI apparently feels a \"duty\" to prevent its grantees from doing that.  To them I say, don't censor discussion, argue your governments case (identifying yourself as the U.S. State Department or whatever).

But if occasional political disagreements with the userbase start to wear you down, just remember that this shows that a diverse group of people are actually using Tails, and I think that cannot really be a bad thing.
