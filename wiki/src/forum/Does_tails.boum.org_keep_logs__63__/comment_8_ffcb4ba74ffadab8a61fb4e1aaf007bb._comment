Comment 7 has it all right. No IP addresses are logged, only the times when pages are accessed. Besides, I'm sure that even if `boum.org` follows its own policy and don't keep (identifying) logs, there certainly could be other entities that are nice enough to keep them for us any way. :)

(My point is that even if a server doesn't keep logs, anyone in position to observe its traffic (e.g. the ISP) can keep the logs for it.)
