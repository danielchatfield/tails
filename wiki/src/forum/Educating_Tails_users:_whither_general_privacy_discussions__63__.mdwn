Quite often Tails/Tor users post Tor-related questions or information here which they feel will be of interest to many Tails users.

Some of these have eventually been shut down with moderator injunctions to take the discussion "elsewhere":

* <https://tails.boum.org/forum/The_Surveillance_Studies_Network/>
* <https://tails.boum.org/forum/Some_dangerously_mistaken_ideas___40____63____41__/>
* <https://tails.boum.org/forum/U.N._report_reveals_secret_law_enforcement_techniques/>

and some haven't (thank you, "Tails"):

* <https://tails.boum.org/forum/Malware/>
* <https://tails.boum.org/forum/Writing_Style_Authorship_Detection_effectively_stopping_us_form_being_anonymous_online/>

(Just to be clear, only one of those threads were started by myself.)

It seems clear from various comments in these threads that

* several Tails users seem to feel strongly that in order to use Tails/Tor safely, now and in the future, users must be aware of a broad range of background issues which have social, economic, legal, and political aspects, and which are moreover in a constant state of flux, so discussions often require updates,

* at least one Tails user seems to want every user of this forum to focus exclusively on "purely technical" issues (so much so that they are unwilling to simply skip threads discussing issues which they consider boring or offensive),

* at least one Tails users seems at times to feel that the Tails developers are somehow conspiring to suppress discussion of broader privacy issues here, for some dark purpose,

* the moderator at different times adopts all of the above viewpoints.

I can think of several plausible reasons why "Tails" might be reluctant to permit general privacy/security background threads here, some of which he/she has confirmed in other threads:

* discussions touching on politics can easily get out of hand and present various moderation challenges
* developer time is better spent coding solutions addressing the lengthy todo list
* discussions offensive to EU law enforcement could result in unpleasant interactions between the website operators and EU authorities, and possibly also in state-sponsored attempts to compromise the security of the forum webserver (some of us suspect that will happen anyway)

I can't deny that those are all valid points, and I for one would like to be (as they say) "part of the solution, not part of the problem".

Unfortunately, "Tails" has admitted that he/she is unable to suggest an alternative forum where broader discussions of privacy/security issues are welcome, and where this forum could regularly send background discussions or inquiries from Tails users concerned about general privacy/security issues which could impact their safety.

So I would like to ask other Tails users to help "Tails" come up with some suggestions which could be put in the Tails forum documentation guidelines.

I think that the criteria for a suitable alternative discussion forum might include:

* is reasonably anonymous (not a mailing list, doesn't require registration to post)
* is reasonably secure (not a frequent source of dangerous malware)
* accepts discussions similar to the examples cited above
* isn't a total trollfest
* has a reasonably large and knowledgeable user community

Please note that the Tor-talk mailing list is for developer-level technical discussion of Tor programming issues, and is not anonymous, so it is far from meeting these criteria.

Sadly, I doubt any such forum yet exists.

So lastly, let me begin what I hope will be a useful discussion by offering my own suggestion:

Apparently "Tails" has regular communication with the Tor Project people, and I'd like to ask him/her to raise the issue of the lacking privacy forum with them.  In all likelihood, they will say that providing such a public webforum would contradict their goal (recently mentioned in another thread here) of keeping on the right side of the FBI (which presumably won't look kindly upon users discussing news stories about state-sponsored malware and other ills of the modern world), but perhaps they would be willing to consider two steps which I think would partially address the problem here:

* a public web forum allowing anonymous posts, offering technical discussion of Tor problems 
* an encrypted anonymous method for privately submitting bug reports, analogous to Whisperback

Perhaps the Tails Project, the Tor Project, Privacy International, the EFF, the ACLU, and some other organizations, can consider joining forces to form a splinter organization with some legal cover from the EFF and ACLU whose sole purpose would be to take on the challenging task of providing a moderated public forum allowing anonymous posts on general background privacy issues as illustrated by the examples above.

As someone already suggested (possibly sarcastically, but the idea is far from implausible), our adversaries have an ever burgeoning interest in gaining insight into what occupies our tiny minds, so one must be wary of offers from shady organizations which may be fronting for our adversaries.
