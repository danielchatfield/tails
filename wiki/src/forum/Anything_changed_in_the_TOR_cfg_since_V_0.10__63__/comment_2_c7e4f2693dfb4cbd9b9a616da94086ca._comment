Oh shit. thx I totally missed that discussion. As I see in the discussion thread see I'm not the only one seeing transparent proxying not only as a risk but using it for sth. really useful.

Is there a switch or config sth. like that to turn it on again? If I have to (re-)build my own TAILS it would be ok for me ;)

Thx for the fast answer
Cheers,
Roger
