How about a switch in the start menu (like for truecrypt after pressing tab)?
So 'experts' (and I) could start Tails with transparent proxying and all others would have the real secure sandbox experience?!
Good idea? What do you think?

PS: Technical question: The transparent proxy settings are defined solely in etc/firewall.conf, right? 
If I would exchange the actual configuration:

######http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/etc/firewall.conf;hb=HEAD
with this:
######http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=config/chroot_local-includes/etc/firewall.conf;hb=0b8a680e5d9dc9001207881204ac392d2bae604f

I would have fixed it for me??

Cheers,
Roger
