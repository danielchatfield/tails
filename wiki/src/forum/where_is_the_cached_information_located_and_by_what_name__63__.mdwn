I've searched for the node info, the 'cached-' files but I cannot find them. I would think they would be generated in ~/.tor or /etc/tor but they are not.

Another issue. There is one file located in ~/.tor and it's colored red:

~/.tor$ ls -l
control_auth_cookie -> /tmp/control_auth_cookie

What is that doing there?
