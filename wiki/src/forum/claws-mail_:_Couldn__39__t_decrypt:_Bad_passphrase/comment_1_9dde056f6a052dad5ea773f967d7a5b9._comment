I have no experience of using claws nor specifically claws' encryption tools.

I would assume that a reboot would allow you to start the process again.

If that's too much hassle, restoring claws' settings folder located in amnesic's home folder to a default fresh state (as it should be after each boot) should provide the same result. If the tails team have included settings for claws in the home folder you should be careful messing about with these kind of things though.

Restoring the settings to a fresh state in the home folder will make the application act as if it has never been opened or used yet (same effect as reboot but specific to the application). Hopefully this is a little helpful, or at least better than nothing!
