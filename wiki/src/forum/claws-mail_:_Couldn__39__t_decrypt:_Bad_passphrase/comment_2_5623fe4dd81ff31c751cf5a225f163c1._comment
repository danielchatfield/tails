@ comment 2

Thanks for your usefull answer. Indeed, I could restore the .claws-mail folder to his initial state, but I hoped that I missed an option like 'forget the recorded passphrases', or something like this. I'm really surprise that there is nothing like this, and I'm still looking forward to an easier way to solve my problem.

Thanks again, and if somebody have already faced this and found a workaround..
