I've the same problem. I think there is no contradiction in the \"Tail+Data\" request. Persistence is ok, but I cannot read persistence on windows. My problem:

I want just one USB key to do the following:

1) Use TAILS booting it from the USB KEY on linux or windows PC. No problems here.
2) Use the TOR bundle saved on a folder on the key while I'm a PC running on linux. No Problem here because I can save the folder in the persistence partition.
3) Use the TOR bundle saved on a folder on the key while I'm on a PC running windows. It is impossible because windows doesn't read the USB key at all.   

The cases 2 and 3 are of interest because not always you've a PC where you can boot TAIL from the USB key. Think of a public PC with windows, I would like to be able to put the key in and just use the TOR browser located in it. At the moment I can only make two USB keys, one with TAILS and the other with TOR bundles for windows and linux. It would be really useful to have only one USB key.
