i think it works perfectly with unetbootin
to install tails on the first (ext2) partition of the key
(ext2 beter than ext3 because no journalisation)

so install unetbootin, download and check tails, start unetbootin.
tell it to install your iso (navigate to choose the location where
tails iso is), choose the usbkey partition : make sure to install on 
the right location ! under linux you may use gparted to check the
name of the partition, alternate prefered method with :

$ ls -l /dev/disk/by-id  (in a console), 

once unetbootin finished click restart.

there is also an other thing : your computer may need some tuning in the setup
to be able to start from an external media OR use the boot menu to select your key
(usually f12 at startup)
