The problem is that windows only reads the first partition of usb key and doesn't decrypt LUKS (in native)... So, I guess the idea of making a dedicated partition for storage have still it interest. 

Probably a such usage and partition of the key is in contradiction with the Tails' aims ; however, as far as I understand, the popularisation of this distribution contributes to anonymize it. So making a such bi-partitions (tails + data) possible will lead me and other few guys to use Tails. Well, I hope are my sentences are understandable...
