Try to Google for the error message that Pidgin is giving you. You'll see that this is a quite common problem. Either a bug in Pidgin, either a change in the ICQ protocol, either a ‘security’ measure from ICQ to block Tor users or Pidgin.

But nothing we can directly act upon from Tails as far as I understand.
