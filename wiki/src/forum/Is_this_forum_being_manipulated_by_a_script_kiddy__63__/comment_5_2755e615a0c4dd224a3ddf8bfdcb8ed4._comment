You wrote \"I'm pretty drunk now, so sorry if this doesn't make any sense.\"  I hope no-one will take this the wrong way, but I hope that if you come back when you are sober you will see that posting while drunk, particularly to a forum which discusses security-sensitive topics, could possibly be fairly characterized as \"high-risk behavior\".  (Tor is not designed to prevent you from doing something unsafe while intoxicated, so my well-intentioned advice is off topic, but I think my point does illustrate a wider point: to use Tors safely, especially if you ever use Tors for high risk activity with a point, like political activism, you need to stay alert and to think before you click.)
