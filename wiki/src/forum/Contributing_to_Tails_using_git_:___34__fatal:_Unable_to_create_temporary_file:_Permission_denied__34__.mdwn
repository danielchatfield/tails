I would like to contribute to Tails using git, so :

- I forked [Tails repository](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git) on http://repo.or.cz
- Assigned myself as a user, as you can see [here](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails/matsa.git)
- Updated my ssh key [here](http://repo.or.cz/edituser.cgi)


But, when I try to push, I get an error message :

    	amnesia@amnesia:~/tails/ git push matsapussh master
    	Compressing objects: 100% (13302/13302), done.
    	fatal: Unable to create temporary file: Permission denied
    	error: pack-objects died of signal 13
    	error: pack-objects died with strange error
    	error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://matsa@repo.or.cz/srv/git/matsa.git'

Here are the interesting parts of .git/config :

    	[core]
    		repositoryformatversion = 0
    		filemode = true
    		bare = false
    		logallrefupdates = true
    	[remote "origin"]
    		fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    		url = git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
    	[branch "master"]
    		remote = origin
    		merge = refs/heads/master
    	[user]
    		name = matsa
    		email = ...
    	[remote "matsapussh"]
    		url = ssh://matsa@repo.or.cz/srv/git/matsa.git
    		fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/matsapussh/*

I have no clue if its coming from my local files, from the repo.or.cz chmod, ssh or git config.. I could spend hours reading docs (in fact I did), but perhaps you already faced this message while using repo.or.cz...
