It should be obvious by now, that the only way to communicate stealthily and securely is to avoid raising suspicion to the level at which the authorities might consider it worthwhile to put you under active surveillance (e.g., park a van with TEMPEST equipment by your apartment). Moreover, the medium for such a communication must be the Internet, since since it is the only publicly available medium that has seen any serious development of anonymous and/or secure communication.
Let's go over some specific methods of clandestine information exchange over the net:
Encrypted e-mail
Although apparently secure, this method puts the communicating parties at great risk of detection. E-mail servers are centralized, and accounts are easily associated with message transmission times and locations. Once a single member of the communication network becomes suspect, the whole network is immediately exposed. This holds for all similar server-dependent protocols.
E-mail accessed exclusively over onion routing
This is a much better approach than just e-mail, but it is still susceptible to traffic analysis, and to control of the communication channel by an external party.
Usenet posts
This is a good approach to clandestine communication. Since Usenet is a distributed system, traffic analysis is non-trivial, and messages can be steganographically hidden inside innocent-looking posts (e.g., SPAM) in some high-traffic unmoderated group. Many users will read the message, oblivious to its true contentsâ€”thus protecting the message recipient from scrutiny.
Freenet analogues of the above, such as Freemail and Frost
Certainly a better alternative to e-mail and Usenet, a Freenet client is too heavy for fast and mobile deployment. Also, Freenet is somewhat raw at the moment. However, it might become the best alternative at some point in the future.
Tor hidden services
A lightweight and reliable alternative to Freenet tools, hidden services suffer from one drawback: both parties must be online during message transmission. Otherwise, the security of this solution is rather well-researched, and traffic analysis appears to be far from trivial. Moreover, Tor is a subject of active development and research, making this approach a long-term one.
