Yes, this is off topic, but it is related to the general subject. Thank you for sharing your story. Too bad that nymservers are a pain to configure. A tails integration of nymservers plus remailers would be very interesting for the users with very high anonymity requirements. Unfortunately this includes the disgusting people talked above but the privacy of everybody should not be sacrificed to catch a few as has been the case lately. Yet, how would one reach usenet from tails without a usenet service provider? Could perhaps sites like the late newsbin be used?
