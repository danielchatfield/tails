I'm new to Tor and Tails.  I've just spent a few hours signing up and testing the three big webmail solutions:  Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo.

I'm unable to create a gmail account without SMS verifcation, So no luck there.
A Hotmail account is simple to create, but you can't use the interface(I suspect it's to do with blocking javascript)
You can create Yahoo account very quickly and the webmail interface works.  So it looks like I'm stuck with Yahoo, for the time being.

I was hoping to sign up for a Google account so I can participate in Google Plus, reporting on local issues.
