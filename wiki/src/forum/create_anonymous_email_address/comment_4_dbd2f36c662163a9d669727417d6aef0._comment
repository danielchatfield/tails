The issue I am having is that Gmail authenticates to a local server. i.e. google.com.**   in other words the local gov/authority gets access (legally) to the server. Since Gmail authenticates to the local domain, I can presume that the local gov has access to username and password of the account.

I do not have anything to hide. I am against the n00bish principle that \"There this guy standing behind me with a big knife, but there is no worry cause he has not stabbed me yet\".

I would be happy with a simple webmail that respects my right for privacy. I have yet to find one. Riseup.net seems decent, and I was able to get an account, but I need to make sure that some of the people I know can get a safe webmail too.

I could not even open an account in GMX. I am thinking that they prevent people from the country I am residing in from getting accounts to avoid the wrath of the local gov.
