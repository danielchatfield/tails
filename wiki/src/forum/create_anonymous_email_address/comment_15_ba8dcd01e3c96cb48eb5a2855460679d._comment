I found something working with Tails: fastmail.fm

You unfortunatly have to provide a verification email adress. You can use a jetable email: Yopmail is not accepted for this step, but http://get2mail.fr works fine.

I didn't try with disactivated javascript.

I've discard GMX, I was getting this error message: \"Your registration could not be processed at the moment. Please try again later. If the error persists, please contact us.\"
