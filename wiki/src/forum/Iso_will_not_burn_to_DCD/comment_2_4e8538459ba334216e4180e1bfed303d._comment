It is not a matter of the steps followed, rather that the size of the ISO file that can fit on a CD-R is at most 700MB + some, but certainly not 753MB which requires either a DVD-R, DVD-RW, or a USB preferably at least 2GB in size.

I have found that using Ubuntu Disk Utility to unformat a USB and then simply using the dd command with the proper device name does the job nicely, e.g.

    dd if=tails-0.11.iso of=/dev/sdx

where x is an alphabet character for the entire USB device identified by Disk Utility.
