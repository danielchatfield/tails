If you want to see what files a process has open, such as tor, open a root terminal and type:

# lsof -p $(pidof tor)

or for wget:

# lsof -p $(pidof wget)

This assumes you only have one instance of the program concerned running.  This includes sockets, /dev/null, and other stuff that you would not normally consider as \"files\".

Try that,  I doubt your system is doing anything untoward.
