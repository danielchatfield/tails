I've discovered some other troubles with wget.

wget either stalls after a short while of downloading, and the countdown timer goes flat, or, the connection is broken and it attempts to retry but it cannot resume unless you restart your network connection (manually killing the tor process I still don't know why this has to be) and resume with 'wget -c'. There are errors in polipo's log file for wget. Try it yourself with a large file.

The solution is to use the browser to download the file. While there is no resume option (please include UGET DOWNLOAD MANAGER) there are less problems.
