I wrote the last two posts. Just to be clear, I'm talking about when I exit TorBrowser from Vidalia. If I remember correctly the process often remains locked for a long time. I noticed because it is on a TrueCrypt partition that I have to unmount before I can shutdown. The partition won't unmount until I kill Vidalia. Filesystem is ext (not sure which version).
