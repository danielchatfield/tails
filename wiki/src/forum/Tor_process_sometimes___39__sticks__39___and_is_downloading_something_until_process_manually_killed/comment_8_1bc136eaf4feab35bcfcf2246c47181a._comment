I'm totally confused about the \"closing Vidalia closes the browser\" part.

About the Tor process downloading stuff: yeah, it has to keep enough circuits ready and fetch updated information about the state of the Tor network. In itself, the fact that Tor is using *some* amount of network ressources is not surprising. How much bytes are we talking of?

About wget / iceweasel: wget goes through Polipo, iceweasel talks directly to Tor. This may explain much.
