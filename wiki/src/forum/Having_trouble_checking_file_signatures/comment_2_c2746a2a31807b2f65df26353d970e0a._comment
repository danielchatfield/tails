The problem isn't necessarily Tails; it's either that I don't propery know how to check signatures or something is altering my downloads by the time I go to check the signature.

I downloaded GPGTools to verify the signature of the Tails torrent file, however the signature given for GPGTools was different than what I came up with. Since I can't verify GPGTools to install it, I can't verify Tails.
