This is very naive question.

Please could someone comment on risk (or absence of risk) to have a webcam attached (or built-in) to machine running Tails.

I have read about cameras being hacked and then used by the hacker to spy on the user. Is this even possible with Tails? For example, I assume (maybe I am wrong) that if there are no drivers for webcams in the distro then risk is zero. If drivers are included, then what?

I did Google search for "tails amnesic webcam" but it gives no relevant result.
