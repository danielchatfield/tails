To save \"Tails\" the trouble of pointing out the obvious:

I don't want to be too harsh, but someone should try to explain why so many things are wrong with this \"report\".

> what was probably a dodgy webpage (what looked like wikileaks twitter advert links - if these exist, causing the browser to freeze and crash Tails - some sort of browser malware that manages to hack FF 10 I would guess).

You rushed straight to the least likely conclusion (on the basis of the limited information you provided), and you failed to record and report details which might tend to support (or refute) your suspicions.  

You say you were using a laptop.  How much RAM does it have?  If you have too little RAM available, Tails might have difficulty managing memory.  (Make and model of laptop can be useful for addressing genuine bugs but I don't think this report rises to that standard, at least not yet.)

You say you noticed high memory usage.  But you should know that Tails is based on Debian, which uses the Linux OS.  And it is normal for Linux kernels to use up all free memory before they start to make decisions about removing things from memory.  Usually a more reliable indication that you are truly running short on memory occurs when Linux starts to use swap.  

When you booted Tails did you set a root password so you can run commands as the superuser?  Did you use ps -ef to list the running processes?  The command lsof -i can list open files (in Linux everything is a file) related to internet activity.  Unfortunately Tails doesn't come with iftop but that can help track incoming and outgoing packets and connections.

Were you using Tails booted from a DVD?  An USB drive?  What version?

You say you visited a \"probably dodgy\" webpage.  Which page?  Or at least which domain?  Or at least some indication of what features appeared \"dodgy\".  

Did you modify the default configurations of Tails I/W or NoScript or...?  If you turned off Javascript, that might cause websites to appear to be acting strangely.  If you were visiting a site which uses a CDN (content delivery network), these can appear to hang if you are using Tor because the CDN (or a Tor router operated by a multinational CDN, such as Akamai) is trying to figure out your identity, or is trying to do something slightly less objectionable but possibly no less dangerous to Tor users.

Did you use about:cache to inspect items loaded by your browser when you visit that page?  Could you  live-install and use AdBlock to see what code it block at that page?

You claim tails \"crashed\": do you really mean a kernel panic?  Or just that you got frustrated and rebooted the laptop yourself?

Finally, \"Tails\" says that this forum is not for bug reports, although the OP is certainly not anything I would recognize as bug report, so maybe it is just as well that you posted here, where another Tails user can try to encourage you to try harder to provide useful information in future.  If you look on the Tails Documentation page you can probably find more tips on what kinds of information are useful in a bug report.
