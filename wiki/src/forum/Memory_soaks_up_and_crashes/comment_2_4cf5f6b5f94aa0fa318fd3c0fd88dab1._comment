OK, thanks for taking the time to reply.

I'm posting under (urban!) 'battlefield' conditions here, so if you can excuse the lack of anything other than basic reporting.

I've just had to reboot again - the panel system monitor widget showed memory fully used (75% cache, not enough progs open to justify this though), followed by the desktop gradually slowing down to unusable speeds, at which point in the past things have either completely ground to a halt or recovered after 15 mins of being left alone.  (One other strange going on, the network connection disconnecting while the cable is still securely plugged in - I'm not sure what this is all about, only a recent happening.)

I haven't changed anything though I do run (compiled) nodejs in debug server mode, and flash in the unsafe browser (which is very unsafe - no correlation between this and freezes though).  No other versions of Tails have ever behaved this way - though this is the first time I have set up the currently experimental obsf proxy (there were not many servers supporting this the last time I looked - so I will be skipping this for now).

Running current Tails on a laptop with 2 gig of memory btw, from USB.

I will try and post more data in future.
