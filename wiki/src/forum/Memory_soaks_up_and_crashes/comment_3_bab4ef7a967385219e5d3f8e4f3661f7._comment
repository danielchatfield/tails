I experience similar symptoms with Tails 0.15  (Dell laptop, VMware 9, 1G RAM allocated).     Only use after boot is browsing with Ice Weasel.

After roughly 20-30 mins. TAILS virtual machine stops responding to any user input.   CPU usage on VMware host jumps to 40-50%.     I wait several minutes but the CPU spike continues and the TAILS vm stops responding to user input.

Tried it Virtual box.    Same issue.  After 15-20 mins.   CPU usage spike and Tails stops responding to user input.

I know this is insufficient information.    I can reproduce this consistently -- I tried this about 10 times.
