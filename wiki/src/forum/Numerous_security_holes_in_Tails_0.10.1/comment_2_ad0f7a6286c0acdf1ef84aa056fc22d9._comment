While it appears to be well-made, I distrust Liberte Linux for three reasons:

1.  No user forum or email discussion list *AT ALL*.   So no way to initiate public discussions for support with the devs.  While we all know that Tails has the worst, most useless user forum in the entire world, at least it has one.  Any project that has no way of interacting with its user community is unfriendly and highly suspicious.

2. The Liberte logo is also used by Anonymous, an unaccountable network of script kiddies, hackers and activists.  They have trojaned legitimate-seeming software before, even obtaining a real security certificate for their trojan from someone at Mozilla who believed that outing a few pedophiles was more important than proving that Mozilla cannot be trusted to maintain the integrity of the Firefox add-on security structure.  (A major security breach at Mozilla that I hope lead to sackings).  They could similarly trojan Liberte to look for traffic from targets du jour, in the process potentially compromising all Liberte users' privacy even if trying to be selective.  Sure, the Liberte site *says* there is no association with the board groups that used that logo and spawned Anonymous.  But hackers are notoriously ironic.

3. Root shell is not accessible so many seconds after boot.  For an old linux hand, not being able to get a root shell (eg to install software) is a complete unusable pain in the ass.  If being able to get a root shell at all is best disabled for security reasons, why not just not give the user sudo rights and protect it with a long strong password which is set on boot.
