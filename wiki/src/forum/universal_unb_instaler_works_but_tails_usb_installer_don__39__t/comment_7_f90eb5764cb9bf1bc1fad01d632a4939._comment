sorry, i'm new in the linux area and don't know how to use UEFI does it cames with tails or i have to install it?

doing my \"home work\" i lerned that Unified Extensible Firmware Interface is better then BIOS and is a programmable software interface that sits on top a computerâ€™s hardware and firmware, is that right?

but i don't know how to use it, can someone help me?

thanks
