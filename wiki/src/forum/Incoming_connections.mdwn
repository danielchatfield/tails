Hi,
your about page says, all outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network. I wonder what about the incoming connections? I noticed in particular that when using IceWeasel in Tails and the Save File dialogue gets triggered, I am warned that this may not go through Tor (or something), and that using Tails would be safer. So I am on tails, can I disregard the warning? I'm confused.

Thanks.
