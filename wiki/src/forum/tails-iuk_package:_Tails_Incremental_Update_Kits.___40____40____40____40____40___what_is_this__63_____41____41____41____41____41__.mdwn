*I noticed this:*

    tails-iuk-get-target-file:x:113:118::/home/tails-iuk-get-target-file:/bin/false
    
    
    tails-install-iuk:x:114:119::/home/tails-install-iuk:/bin/false

*in /etc/passwd*

*and this:*
    
    tails-iuk-get-target-file **Never logged in**
    
    tails-install-iuk  **Never logged in**
    
*from 'lastlog'*
    
*so I launch Synaptic and search for and find:*
    
    tails-iuk package:
    
    create, download and install Tails Incremental Update Kits
    
    Tools and libraries to create, download and install
    Tails Incremental Update Kits.
    
    The suggested packages are only needed to create an
    IUK, and can be safely ignored by end-users.

*If this package is not for end users, why is it installed and is it safe for the end users to remove?*
