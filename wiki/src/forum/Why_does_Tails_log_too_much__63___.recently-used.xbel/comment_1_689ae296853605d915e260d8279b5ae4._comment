> Why would Tails need to log all these things during the session?

Because it's useful and convenient, and does not conflict with [[our design goals|contribute/design]].

> Can an option be made for Tails to be log free or normal where the user can choose between the two?

I guess it may be possible to convince us to accept a good patch that implements this. But *please*, first document very well the kind of threats you want to protect against, and then think if/how the intended implementation really does :)
