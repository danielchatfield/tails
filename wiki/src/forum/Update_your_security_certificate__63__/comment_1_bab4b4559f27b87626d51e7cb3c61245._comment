Your browser is showing a security warning when trying to access our website
using HTTPS because the server hosting tails.boum.org doesn't own a SSL
certificate recognized by the major browser vendors.

Still, a certificate from the alternative certificate authority
[CACert](http://www.cacert.org/) is available and you could prevent this
security warning from appearing by **installing into your browser the root
certificate of CACert**.

This certificate is **included by default in Debian** and **available in
Ubuntu** through the `ca-certificate` package.

You can also **install it by hand** by visiting this link:
<http://www.cacert.org/certs/root.crt> then selecting all the options and
validating. The downside of this approach is that you will download the
certificate through plain HTTP.

We acknowledge the fact that having a mainstream HTTPS certificate sold by a
commercial certificate authorities would be a improvement for our website and we
are planning to get one at some point.

Still, such certificates are not the
perfect solution to verify the authenticity of a website and several controversies have recently proven that this model of trust on Internet can be compromised:

When having to trust a Tails ISO image that you downloaded through this website
we recommend you to use stronger ways of verifying it that could be independent
of the HTTPS on this website, see:
