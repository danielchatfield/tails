Yes, I did follow the link you suggest - around and around in circles.  Let me give you an idea of what kind of information I am seeking:  goto http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuzilla/3.6.16/ There you see:

All I am asking for is a link or instructions on how to acquire the signing key or signature key file that would be able to verify the download and the commands to use in a Terminal window - in the documentation.  I see no linkable key or signature files when I play merry-go-round with your reply link in reading and following the information your posted.

In a word - not to be rude, but the documentation is a bit shy of providing useful information on the topic of verifying the download - especially where there is missing information to allow that to happen.  Maybe you understand it, but I certainly do not - in the easy straightforward way the Icecat example above presents.

Thanks for understanding.
