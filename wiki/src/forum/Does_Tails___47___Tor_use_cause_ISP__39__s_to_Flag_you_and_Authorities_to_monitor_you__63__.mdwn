I heard that using Tails / Tor will get you automatically flagged by your ISP and then investigated / monitored by police / authorities on grounds of suspicious behavior! Is this true? Apparently they think you are likely to be a criminal or terrorist if you're using Tails / Tor!! I dont want to get on any terrorist lists since im definitely not one!! This is quite scary! Im in UK and not sure of the laws in relation to ISP's ability to "flag" someone or laws concerning authorities ability to monitor someone and put them on "watch lists". Can anyone confirm any of this? Is it the same for all of the EU countries? Im very concerned! I'd rather quit using Tails / Tor than be put on possible criminal/terrorist watch lists!!
