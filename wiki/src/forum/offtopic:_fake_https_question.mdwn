Hello

This is not about Tails, but about security, so i hope u will answer. I'm not that experienced user and there are lots of "blank pages" in my head about security.

When using Tails some web-sites that offer https connection are blocked cause of "unfair certificate". User is asked if he really wanna use this connection and even add this certificate to exeption.

Question.

What are the risks of using such https connection? What kind of data can be stolen, comprimised?
Real IP adress? Or is it just a traffic between exit node and this site? Or something else?

If u don't have time to answer such a lame stupid question, u can just give a link to the info. I hope it won't be google ;) Any trusted scource.
