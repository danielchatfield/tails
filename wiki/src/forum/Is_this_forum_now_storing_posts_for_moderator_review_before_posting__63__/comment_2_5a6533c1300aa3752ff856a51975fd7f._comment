Yes, to legit websites.  On second thought I can see why moderating a submitted post containing external links is a good idea!

I was trying to answer a question from someone whom I thought would benefit from reading some introductions to surveillance generally (ACLU, EFF) before re-reading the tails documentation \"Warnings!\".

While I'm on the subject, I'm interested in volunteering to help with the documentation by trying to provide more background on modern surveillance methods as well as some important topics like authorship attribution methods, all of which are obviously relevant to helping Tails users understand better how to use Tails to help augment their privacy (and how messing up can easily undo any goodness Tails might provide).
