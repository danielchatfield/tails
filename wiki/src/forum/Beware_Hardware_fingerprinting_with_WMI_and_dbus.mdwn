I just found out you can use a site like facebook and others to run java or other scripts to get a hardware fingerprint using WMI (windows) or D-Bus (linux). If you use Tails on your PC to access a specific site over Tor your hardware can be fingerprinted using WMI or D-BUS on that site. Afterward if you use the same PC on a non-tor internet connection you can be tracked and identified with your hardware fingerprint through WMI or D-Bus scripts. 

For example you access an account on facebook over TOR. facebook then uses scripts or other methods to get your "hardware fingerprint". Afterward you login to facebook using the same hardware but a different account over a regular non-tor internet connection. facebook uses the WMI or D-Bus "hardware fingerprint" to link both accounts then identify and track your location. Does Tails protect you from WMI or D-bus "hardware fingerprinting"?
