Aside from OP's idea, this thread is full of garbage. The key wouldn't have to be saved in plain text. Truecrypt can do full system encryption in Windows, correct? I'm sure its possible in Tails, somehow. And NO. A resounding, earth shattering NO...it is NOT illegal to withhold encryption keys from Law Enforcement. Not in the US anyway. The Supreme Court has already ruled, and upheld the defendant's rights to secure personal information. If the police can't in, you are NOT obligated to HELP them do so. And if they uphold that judgment in a CP case (IIRC), then anything that decent people like us are doing will be fine.
