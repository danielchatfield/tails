\" you probably do not want the police to control your thumb drive and find tools specifically designed to avoid government control such as Tails or Tor. such tools, would be at least \"suspicious\" when not illegal.\"

------------------------------------------------

Precisely! The people who advance such arguments ,to which the quoted above poster has replied , apparently have lack of understanding of the investigative techniques, how data is collected, analyzed and stored for future use by the adversary. Mere possession of tools like Tails can be used in prosecution by connecting it to other seemingly circumstantial evidence. Why help the enemy? 

  As for supposed degradation in performance ( slowing down) by TrueCrypt, I've not noticed any to complain about while reading/writing TC containers in WIndows XP on a n270 netbook. By today's standards it's a slow hardware. Anything newer and faster would be slowed down even less.
===============================================

\".. that plaintext code could easily be replaced with something which would appear to function identically but... \"
----------------------------------------
  The argument is irrelevant.Lack of TrueCrypt does not prevent this possibility of tampering from happening, proper security protocol does.
==========================================================

\"...You do know that there are laws which make it a criminal offence to withhold your encryption keys from the police...\"
-------------------------------------------
  Those who are in such a danger should not use TrueCrypt ( erase it)  without denying it to those who are not ( as in a different , less despotic jurisdiction).
===========================================

  After reading more of the silly anti-TC \"arguments\" I've realized I'm dealing with  immature child's mind(s). Bottom line - don't like TC don't use it ( remove altogether if so paranoid) and don't worry about those who use and need it.
