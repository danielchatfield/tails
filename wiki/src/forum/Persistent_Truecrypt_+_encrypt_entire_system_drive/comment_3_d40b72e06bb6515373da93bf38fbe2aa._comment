Forget about truecrypt since it supports full disk encryptation (FDE) only in windows. 

however here you have some useful links about full disk encryptation on linux for you to get an idea:
 on ubuntu: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Encrypted-Ubuntu-8-04-85271.shtml
 on fedora (and ubuntu again): http://dailyanarchist.com/2012/02/20/full-disk-encryption-for-ubuntu-and-fedora/ (and comment about FDE on debian: http://dailyanarchist.com/2012/02/20/full-disk-encryption-for-ubuntu-and-fedora/comment-page-1/#comment-83482 )
on android: http://source.android.com/tech/encryption/android_crypto_implementation.html
