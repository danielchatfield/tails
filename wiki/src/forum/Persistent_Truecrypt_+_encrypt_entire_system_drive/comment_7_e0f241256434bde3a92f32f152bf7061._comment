 \"What would be the point, exactly, to encrypt your Tails system?\":

1.If you're a dissident involved on any kind of anti-government activity and frequently getting controlled or detained by the police, you probably do not want the police to control your thumb drive and find tools specifically designed to avoid government control such as Tails or Tor. such tools, would be at least \"suspicious\" when not illegal.
2.if you modify your system for instance to add a program you need or a firefox plug-in in a persistence mode, your system's \"amnesia\" may be compromised. For instance,  Firefox cannot avoid that extensions record the browser history.
3.Tails doesn't encrypt your documents by default.
4.Tails doesn't clear the metadata of your documents for you.
5.Tails does not wipe the persistence folders.
6. wiping does work for traditional magnetic hard drives but sometimes don't work properly with some flash USB drives.

For all those reasons (and surely others) full system drive encryption would certainly add a needed second layer of security to the just \"wipe\", and therefore The Amnesic Incognito Live System would become even more incognito and secure for its use on hostile environments.
