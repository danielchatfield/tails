>>\"\"Indeed. Destroying data is a very thorny problem. The only reliable solution is to ensure complete destruction of all the storage media.\"\"

>So happy you finaly agree!!! ^_^ (only that should be enough to convince you that just wiping your system's data is not enough and therefore entire drive encryptation including system is a good measure indeed in terms of privacy security, for a incognito system to have.)

Agree? What does the necessity for total obliteration of every medium tainted by sensitive data have to do with your insistence that one of my many copies of libc6 should be cryptographically obfuscated? Or are you now suggesting that the final step of Tail's shut-down process should be some sort of thermonuclear detonation? If so, I *still* disagree.

>>\"\"While, naturally, I despise the loathsome regime I live under, I imagine any such upheaval would deliver something incomparably worse, so I certainly have no intentions of ever doing anything to incite such events\"\"

>I asume you wouldn't have participated in any of the arab spring revolutions, or The American Revolution, or The French Revolution.

Of course you do. More fallacious presumption. Splendid. I'm suddenly overcome with a desperate yearning to encrypt one of the Linux distributions I use.

Perhaps I might clear up your confusion:

* I don't inhabit some despotic middle eastern state.

* I don't inhabit the 18th century.

* I'm not at all convinced that *any* of your glorious examples resulted in *any* improvement. Despite the incessant nationalist propaganda. Try comparing them with their less bloody neighbours.

* I *am* completely convinced that *all* your glorious examples involved an absolutely immense amount death, destruction, maiming, disease, suffering...

* I do not have a desire to inflict such a period of intense bloody turmoil, subsiding into a more protracted period of lawless chaos which would gradually subside into a (possibly somewhat *more* corrupt, violent and generally *inferior*!.. but pretty much indistinguishable) variation of what would have come about anyway, onto my country, its people, or myself. That's despite the thorough indoctrination you've clearly received at school and via \"the media\".

* Would **I** have participated in such events. Who knows? Not **I**. Without being there and personally experiencing the complex blend of desperation, hopelessness, hope, frustration, fear, etc., that these people seem to endure. While at the same time, eradicating my insight and hindsight afforded by centuries worth of subsequent history and the comfortably detached onlookers perspective which we are fortunate enough to enjoy, I can not even begin to meaningfully speculate into whether I might participate. It is however *usual* for there to be a peaceful *majority* who do *not* resort to arms. If (and it's an immense if) I was to find myself in the midst of some such event, would I want a large block of encrypted data sitting on my computer. No. ABSOLUTELY NOT. ESPECIALLY NOT if all it was hiding was some random crappy Linux distro! Not that I imagine that would matter. I'm pretty sure that simply not being obviously and demonstrably on the side of whichever party of belligerents happened to have just smashed my door in would be perfectly sufficient to get me killed on the spot. What is your half-baked speculation into whether I'd be running around killing people during a revolution supposed to have to do with a stupid suggestion to turn an operation system into a huge block of encrypted data?
