\"Improve? How exactly? Other than making Tails slower\" : HDE will not slow your PC down. Your individual files are encrypted and decrypted “on the fly” as they are accessed. impact on performance is negligible, and common users won't ever notice.

\"If Tails was distributed in encrypted for, the key would obviously be distributed with it\" : of course that would be stupid. what is being requested instead is a way to encrypt the system during installation in a similar way as ubuntu/fedora/debian already offer, or a program allowing to do that in  a easy way or similar way as truecrypt does on windows. of course the key is chosen by the user.

\"Whole system encryption\" does not exist. It is impossible. A custom designed system could possibly include an ASIC bootloader/decryption system\" :System encryption involves pre-boot authentication, which means that anyone who wants to gain access and use the encrypted system, read and write files stored on the system drive, etc., will need to enter the correct password each time before the system boots (starts). Pre-boot authentication is handled by a boot loader, which resides in the first track of the boot drive. It does not have the key, it will mainly ask you the key and try to begin on-the-fly decryption. if its not working it will mean that that's not the right key and will ask you again for the key.

\"A custom designed system could possibly include an ASIC bootloader/decryption system but even that could be fuzzed. You have not fabricated such a system. Your bootloader and decryption code would sit on your HD/USB/DVD in plaintext for all the world to see/pwn.\" : false. strong encryption is virtually uncrackable and there’s no denying its growing popularity. so it's a great anti-forensic method.
