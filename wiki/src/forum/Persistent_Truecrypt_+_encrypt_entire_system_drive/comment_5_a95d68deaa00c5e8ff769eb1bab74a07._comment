That's what I was wondering.

>Tails + encrypted system = Tails Ultimate Edition.

Or \"Tails Unlimited Confusion\" perhaps?

>A great idea that would definitely improve Tails. 

Improve? How exactly? Other than making Tails slower and thus affording users more meditation time.

OP, what are you trying to achieve exactly? All I can think of is some sort of system-tampering-prevention. Unfortunately encryption would be pretty useless, even for that:

1. If Tails was distributed in encrypted for, the key would obviously be distributed with it.

2. \"Whole system encryption\" does not exist. It is impossible. A custom designed system could possibly include an ASIC bootloader/decryption system but even that could be fuzzed. You have not fabricated such a system. Your bootloader and decryption code would sit on your HD/USB/DVD in plaintext for all the world to see/pwn.
