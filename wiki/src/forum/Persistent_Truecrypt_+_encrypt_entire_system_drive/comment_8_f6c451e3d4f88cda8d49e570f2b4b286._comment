>>\"Improve? How exactly? Other than making Tails slower\"

>HDE will not slow your PC down. Your individual files are encrypted and decrypted “on the fly” as they are accessed. impact on performance is negligible, and common users won't ever notice.

Thank you, I'm aware of the theory but we're not talking about *my* files here, we're talking about the entire system and on my modest mono-core, mono-thread notebook there's a discernible impact on both boot speed and system responsiveness for, as I see it, no benefit whatsoever.

>>\"Whole system encryption\" does not exist. It is impossible. A custom designed system could possibly include an ASIC bootloader/decryption system\"

>System encryption involves pre-boot authentication, which means that anyone who wants to gain access and use the encrypted system, read and write files stored on the system drive, etc., will need to enter the correct password each time before the system boots (starts). Pre-boot authentication is handled by a boot loader, which resides in the first track of the boot drive. It does not have the key, it will mainly ask you the key and try to begin on-the-fly decryption. if its not working it will mean that that's not the right key and will ask you again for the key.

Yes, isn't that exactly what I said.

>>\"A custom designed system could possibly include an ASIC bootloader/decryption system but even that could be fuzzed. You have not fabricated such a system. Your bootloader and decryption code would sit on your HD/USB/DVD in plaintext for all the world to see/pwn.\"

>false.

Damn. No it isn't! Just when I thought you agreed... \"*Pre-boot authentication is handled by a boot loader, which resides in the first track of the boot drive.*\" So, as we've both already stated the \"encrypted system's\" boot and cryptography code reside on the medium *in plaintext*. Therefore anyone could examine/modify it as they please. Thus it can be *proven* that you are running an encrypted system. Furthermore that plaintext code could easily be replaced with something which would appear to function identically but quietly cache your key on some arbitrary PCI device, into unused bios/magnetic/flash memory or wherever.

Or was it my mention of the fallibility of custom ASIC \"security\" you found objectionable? If so then I suggest a quick scan through the papers of Dr Anderson @ cam.ac.uk, among others.

>strong encryption is virtually uncrackable

Somewhat irrelevant and utterly unprovable.

>there’s no denying its growing popularity.

I genuinely didn't know that worth is determined by \"growing popularity\". Shit. Now I'll have to review my attitudes towards penis enlargement tablets, war, becoming obese, crystal meth, iPhones, cancer, to name just a few.

>so it's a great anti-forensic method.

Gosh, **anti-forensic**?! Really? Are you sure about that? You do know that there are laws which make it a criminal offence to withhold your encryption keys from the police while it is perfectly legal to run Linux?.. yes, even Tails! How is replacing something perfectly legal and innocent with something criminal \"a great anti-forensic method\"? Surely *any* regime which would persecute its people for possessing a freely available Linux distribution would be moistening the testicle electrodes at withholding encryption keys?

>>\"What would be the point, exactly, to encrypt your Tails system?\":

>1.If you're a dissident involved on any kind of anti-government activity and frequently getting controlled or detained by the police, you probably do not want the police to control your thumb drive...

If they possess it, they control it. No encryption can change that.

>...and find tools specifically designed to avoid government control such as Tails or Tor.

Is that *specifically* what they are for? I use them for personal privacy, against, among other concerns, nosy friends and family, the wholesale data harvesting/profiling/mining/selling conducted by my ISP, petty commercial espionage, etc. Nothing illegal. Nothing anarchistic or revolutionary. While, naturally, I despise the loathsome regime I live under, I imagine any such upheaval would deliver something incomparably worse, so I certainly have no intentions of ever doing anything to incite such events. Am I using the wrong privacy distro? Perhaps you'd be good enough to point me at the Tails for Non-Militants Edition?

>such tools, would be at least \"suspicious\" when not illegal.

Really? \"Yes officer, it's called Tails. It's a Linux distro I've been evaluating\" is *more* suspicious or more likely to be illegal than \"What's that officer? You instruct me under article suchandsuch of the The Plebeians Have No Rights Act to immediately disclose the keys to the encrypted system you've found in my possession? Well fuck you.\" Why does this moronic argument KEEP cropping up?

>2.if you modify your system for instance to add a program you need or a firefox plug-in in a persistence mode, your system's \"amnesia\" may be compromised. For instance, Firefox cannot avoid that extensions record the browser history.

Not sure what you mean here. If you've enabled persistence, the \"persistent\" data *is* encrypted, while the system data is not changed. Anything being stored persistently is already being encrypted.

>3.Tails doesn't encrypt your documents by default.

Again, I'm not sure what you mean here either.

If you've enabled persistence, the \"persistent\" data *is* encrypted. So yes, Tails does encrypt your documents by default!

If you're talking about saving files to *other* external volumes, then many excellent encryption facilities are available for your use at your discretion. Encrypting the Tails system files would have no effect on this.

>4.Tails doesn't clear the metadata of your documents for you.

No. Naturally. Encrypting the Tails system files would have no effect on this either.

>5.Tails does not wipe the persistence folders.

They are encrypted. Do you trust the encryption or not? If not then you really shouldn't be saving *anything* there, should you? If you do then what would be the point?

>6. wiping does work for traditional magnetic hard drives...

Not any more it doesn't. Not since niceties like \"journalled\" file systems, \"fault tolerant\" drives, etc, came along.

>..but sometimes don't work properly with some flash USB drives.

Indeed. Destroying data is a very thorny problem. The **only** reliable solution is to **ensure complete destruction** of **all** the storage media.

What does any of this have to with encrypting your copy of libc6?
