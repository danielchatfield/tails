it has been known that certain usb disks have not worked well with live OS's, either defective by design or they were simply too old. try again with another brand and see if the problem still persists. Ive had good luck with cruzer sticks. also persistence only works after you reboot after setting it up, if you just set it up it wont store anything at first.
