I wonder if this is related to the aufs issue on the tails bug tracker (iirc).

Since it wasn't working, I have deselected network settimgs persistence but left apt persistence and personal files enabled, plus made  the entire amnesia directory persistent (I've used that setting on older tails with success, yes I know I have to overwrite and set up a new amnesia with each new release). See how that goes, just a wild hunch.

It's possible the usb stick is failing though it was a good one.
