You don't have to go to the Root terminal as you can just issue the 

    sudo -i

command from the regular user level terminal and then input the root password.

Issue the command:

    macchanger -a eth0

Whether you will be able to connect to the Internet after changing your computer's Mac address may depend on how your office router(s) are configured. For example, in my ISP's router, every time I change the Mac address, a new table entry is created in the router for it, and eventually, the table's entries roll over.  In other words, there is a fingerprint of the new Mac addresses left in your office router tables (if your office routers behave like my ISP's router) which might be detectable by your office sysadmin and possibly be traceable back to the LAN port of your workstation computer - I do not know for certain about this.  To wipe the fingerprint from your office router(s), you would have to know which router, and then login as admin to the specific router, and execute some commands to flush the table entry that keeps track of the Mac address the macchanger command created that was used for your session.

Of course, after each TAILS session, you would need to reboot your office computer without the TAILS media to get your office computer back to its original state with the Internet connection attached before you boot.

If I were you, I would bring a laptop into the office and use it instead of your office workstation computer, and not use your workstation's LAN port, but then again, I most definitely would not use TAILS from the office if you risk violating your company's Internet usage policies and the chance of getting fired for misuse of company computer assets.  In that regard, you should review your company's Internet usage policy before proceeding to use your company's computer assets with TAILS.
