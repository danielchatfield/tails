>issue the command prior to enabling your network (turning on your router)

Just so I understood you, I should do the following:

1. make sure that the computer is not connected to the internet (as in pulling out the LAN cable from the port of my PC?)
2. boot into the OS
3. create a root account with password at the \"Welcome\" greeter
4. go to \"Accessories\" --> \"Root Terminal\"
5. input the password created in step (A) above when prompted
6. what command(s) do I have to issue to change the MAC address at the root terminal window?

I plan to use Tails at my workstation (after office hours) as the office has a super-fast internet connection in the order of 20 Gbp/s. However all internet connections have to go through the office router(s). Will I be able to connect to the internet after changing the MAC of my office computer?
