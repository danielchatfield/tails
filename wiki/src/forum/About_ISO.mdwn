Good day! 

Help me, I downloaded Tails for CD. It's ISO Image.

My question: I must EXTRACT it on my CD & burn it, or I must  burn only my ISO  and do nothing else ?

I tried to do the first varient (extract + burn & reboot) but my computer don't boot this CD (BIOS is OK - I can boot other CD's, for example: Windows, other Linux(Ubuntu), etc).

How can I fix this problem?

Thank you for you help!
