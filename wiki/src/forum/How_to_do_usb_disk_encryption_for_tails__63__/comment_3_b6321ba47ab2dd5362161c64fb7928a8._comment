Further thoughts:

* you can try to keep a USB stick on your person at all times, but that also be dangerous if you are subject to random \"stop and search\", so...
* if a Tails live USB stick ever leaves your sight, I agree that an adversary could mess with it
* I  think that it might be harder to mess with an encrypted USB stick which holds data
* depending upon the level of chaos in your locale, your adversary might find it faster to just grab you instead of letting you do your thing while they snoop
* on balance, I suspect the best compromise may be to boot Tails from a R/O DVD (harder to substitute unnoticed), and to use encrypted USB sticks sparingly to store sensitive files.
