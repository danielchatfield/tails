@ OP

My suggestions below will save you a lot of anguish and time wasted on asking questions on this forum:

1. Before you use Tails on USB, secure erase/wipe your USB stick and reinstall Tails. That way you can be sure that the OS you are using is free of malware.

2. Oppressive regimes are mostly found in developing countries where law enforcement officials often succumb to accepting bribes. If you and your group of friends have money to spare, bribe them; in exchange they will turn a blind eye to your activities using Tails or Tor.

3. Although the UK does not have an oppressive regime, some of its law enforcement officers are corrupt. The case of Rupert Murdoch's \"News Of The World\" phone hacking scandal comes to mind.

4. Always buy a USB flash drive that has a unique shape in the form of a toy, animal or food. If you need to discard it in a hurry, it can easily blend in with your surroundings. If you have watched \"The Green Hornet\" starring Seth Rogan, you will know what I mean. In that movie the USB stick is in the form of a sushi.

5. Remember even if you are caught with the incriminating USB stick, you always have the option of bribing your captors. Money talks, especially in developing countries.
