How many times do we HAVE to hear the comment?

>Stop wasting the developers time posting in the forum, don't you think it would be better to contribute instead?

This or the many variations of it have been posted in the forum too many times since its **first appearance signed by TAILS**

> Stop wasting the developers time posting in the forum

Lets start from the beginning as to why this suggesting is so wrong
The bottom line is that we are all TAILS developers. TAILS is a community project, run by the community and funded by the community

Those who the community selects to manage and develop  TAILS are given support   such as monetary donations ,  via endorsement from TOR with a link direct from its web page (an amazing contribution not afforded to others)

At no time  are the managers of this project more or less important than those who

**fund it**

**developed the project in the past**

**create over a gazillion programming hours the tools which TAILS cobbles together **

**Developed TOR, ( the whole basis around which TAILS is built )**

**provide feedback in the forum, guidance and information to steer the project in right direction** 

How is it that one contribution is valued so highly that another is said to be “Wasteful of it's time?” 
How is it that suddenly we have developers that can work without feedback from the community which selected them in the first place? 
How would TAILS developers even know how to represent this community and spend it's money, if it was not  for guidance from that community in the first place

** This is where it all started with a comment signed by TAILS **

>If there are people interested to discuss \"Tails vs. Liberté: whatever stuff\", probably they should get themselves organized and create a new discussion space that suit these needs.

Then the next part

>That being said...., The best way to help improve the Tails forum is to start by having a look to where actual work happens. <https://tails.boum.org/forum/TAILS_vs_Liberte:_Support_forums/#comment-c95e2baaafe4fabcc00caa07c60831ea>
 
Then the variations to the TAILS theme

>If you persist in making this deficiency a problem then all you'll achieve is moving messing with the forum up the developers list of priorities thereby diverting them from USEFUL THINGS. If you're trying to help then why not contribute? If you follow that link you'll find a whole section explaining the current plans and work which needs to be done to the website/forum.

This comment states that making any statement about (perceived) deficiency will only divert developers from “useful things” If you want to “help” (implying that there hasn’t been help yet ) why not contribute. (Again linking to TAILS pages on \"Actual contribution\")

again again at 

> Leave them get on with useful thing - likedeveloping!

>If you're trying to help then why not contribute? If you follow that link you'll find a whole section explaining the current plans and work which needs to be done to the website/forum.

AND AGAIN 

>That doesn't read at all like \"a rant\" to me. Just kind, helpful and pertinent advice. Each to his own as they say.If you don't like the way the forum works now, why not  Improve it?

suggesting that attempts to fix problem by posting in forum weren’t relevant and only a link to “actual work” was crontributing




getting vulgar now

>Stop pissing about and contribute

<https://tails.boum.org/forum/Comments_by_Tails_Developers_in_the_Forum._Good__47__bad_lets_talk_about_your_views_on_whats_been_written._Have_your_say_HERE/#comment-e6014501e9d71d71a066b680a8676a96>

Comment 3 
>It's obviously very kind of them to comment at all. If you think you can design a better system then do so

suggesting that attempts to fix problem by posting in forum weren’t relevant and only a link to the “actual work” was crontributing

>Dear developpers,don't loose your time answering this kind of bullshits, and keep on the good work ! To the people participating this 'debate': Don't you think it would be better to contribute, or you are just here to fuck the collective energy?

**TAILS has done a wonderful job illustrating just how important it considers the community who finance and promote its  work**

0 out of 10 score for arrogant TAILS cobblers who haven't a clue how to collaborate with anything more than their own ego
