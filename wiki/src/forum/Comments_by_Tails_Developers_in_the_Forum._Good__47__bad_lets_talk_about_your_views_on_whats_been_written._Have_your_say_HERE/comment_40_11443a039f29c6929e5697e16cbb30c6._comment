>Only this guy, who apparently appointed himself to some sort of guardian for the devs, and posts a neverending stream of unrelated links to the contribution page all over the forum. I bet he is also the one accusing everyone of trolling.

It seems that this person is none other than the TAILS developer himself. He has been very active in the forum all along, running around pretending to be other people and spamming those subjects critical of himself. He spams the topics with the same nonsense over and over again pretending there is confusion, when in reality there is not. The whole time he does this he refers to the developers who would think this and not to disturb the developers that. 

It's pretty revealing that this guy has been in charge of TAILS all along. He sounds like a 16yo pubescent teenager on ritalin. Raving and ranting every time someone is critical of anything he does 

This comment was from the post \"Forum Security - Blogs are being hacked \" 

>Do you also still believe that \"Tails\" are oblivious to this thread, even though the working of this site have been explained to you (with links) over and over again? There's no way the developers are oblivious to this and I'm sure they've looking on in dismay since the beginning.

No I don't still believe that, it was obviously your tragically sad posting after all 

Then this guy goes back to being the TAILS moderator and pretends to try to calm everyone down in comment 62 

>Please calm down people
We very much appreciate to see there is a community that is growing around Tails and people supporting our work. But we are also disappointed to see how the discussions turn into flamewar and insults.

Sadly its not hard to trace his rantings through the whole thing, but to then claim to be the voice of reason. Now thats just too much.
