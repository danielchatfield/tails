When posting in their official capacity or speaking on behalf of the project, TAILS devs (or moderators of the forum) should *consistently* sign their posts as such. 

Otherwise, one can never know whether a given post is actually from a TAILS dev (and therefore carries a certain authority and weight) or just some random anon (who: a) may be trying to impersonate a TAILS dev and, b) may or may not, but is less likely, to know what they are talking about)
