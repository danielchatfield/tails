I think the \"devs\" have got it just about perfect:

If a request for help doesn't get a satisfactory answer, up pops \"Tails\" provide one.

If a completely worthless and offensive post or spam appears, it quietly disappears.

As for the rest of the stuff. Mostly just typical geek forum shit - random arguments, mindless uneducated speculation, conspiracy theories, paranoia, etc. - it's usually simply ignored.

I think the rest of us should *all* try to behave more like \"Tails\".
