Reading this and other thread, I wonder who is really spamming this forum. Specially when even this thread turns into a flamewar and goes out of its topic.

I can understand why people link to the contribute page, they are trying to get you to understand there are other means to help the project than just spending your time on the forum. Sounds like a reasonnable idea, that way no one loose time in there, and at least Tails devs can spend more time on development rather than being interrupted every time by such posts...
