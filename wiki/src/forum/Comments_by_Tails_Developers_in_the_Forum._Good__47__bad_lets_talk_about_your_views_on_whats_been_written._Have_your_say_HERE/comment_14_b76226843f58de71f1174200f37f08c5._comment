These discussions are what is wrong with TAILS forums. Most of the responses are pointless and TAILS is powerless to steer the subject into any sense. 

This topic has obviously been created to help bolster support for flagging TAILS moderators, but most in here are not interested in giving support, but just in pointless arguments. 

comment 2 wins the prize for the only constructive contribution which was on topic. round of applause.

i don't see any problem with what they post in here.
Would like to see a \"normal\" forum/bulletin board instead of this blog post type of stuff. Did we ever vote on that? If you try to comment on an old post that might have some current relevance it stays buried instead of moving to the top of the list.

My opinion is that these forums are out of control and when TAILS does weigh in with its mighty judgement all it comes out with is 

>let's just ignore this troll, he will get tired at some point :-)

Plus two stars for trying to steer these discussions into some kind of order

Minus eight starts for thinking they can do it by name calling and descriptive nonsense like FUD

 TAILS is a project dead in the water. Two stars out of ten
