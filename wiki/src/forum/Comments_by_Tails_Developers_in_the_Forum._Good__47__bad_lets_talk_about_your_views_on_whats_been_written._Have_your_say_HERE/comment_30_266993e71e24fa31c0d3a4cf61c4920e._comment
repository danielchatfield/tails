These discussions are plagued by people intent on spamming the subject by repeating things over and over. Tails is conspicuous in their absence I agree. I have to say I find this whole forum rather childish. 

Have a look at

This discussion is a joke

Tails posting is absent. The forum is leaderless and boring. I can get more sense from school children
