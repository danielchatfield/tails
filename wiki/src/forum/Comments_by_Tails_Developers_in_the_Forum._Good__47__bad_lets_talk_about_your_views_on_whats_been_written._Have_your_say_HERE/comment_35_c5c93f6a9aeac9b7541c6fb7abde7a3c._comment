Don't rise to this.

It's impossible to reason with something not intended to be rational. All you'll achieve is presenting an opportunity for *another* irrational artificially indignant rant. The aim presumably being to start a \"flame war\", if possible involving \"the developers\". It's all puerile and pointless. Don't waste your time!

The best response is to ignore these posts. They're very easy to spot ;)
