@ comment 33

You appear to have some sort of anger management difficulty. Do please try to remain calm, rational and lucid.

As you observe, the title of this thread is:

>Comments by Tails Developers in the Forum. Good/bad lets talk about your views on whats been written. Have your say HERE

It is therefore *about* the developers' responses to other threads... \"Have *your* say HERE\" ...an attempt to solicit opinions of the users about the developers. It's explicitly addressed to everyone but the developers! What did you imagine the developers themselves might have contributed? A string of hapless posts along the lines of:

>I think Tails' comments are great. --Tails

>We do our best. --Tails

>If you think you can do better our software is free. You can fork it into your own project. --Tails

Are they not as malleable as you'd hoped?

You must be very disappointed. Oh well.
