Alright, this is the guy who posted originally a week or so again.. and I'm running into one last problem.. maybe someone can help. So I'm on an Aspire One model, and I have a wifi toggle switch. This is what I'm doing and this is my problem:

1) Start up and turn off wifi via switch when GRUB has handed the machine over to the kernel/initrd
2) When in Tails (and can't connect to any networks since wifi is disabled) type in terminal "ifconfig wlan0 down" otherwise resources remain busy and cannot use macchanger
3) Type in terminal "macchanger -a wlan0" then "macchanger -s wlan0" to see if it worked
4) Type in terminal "ifconfig wlan0 up" to enable wlan0 again
5) Try to use toggle switch on Acer model, LED does not activate. Try holding for 3, 5, 10 and 20 seconds.. nothing. Can't connect to networks

Steps 1-4 work perfectly, thanks for all the help so far. My issue is re-enabling wifi via the toggle switch. Is there a way I can do this via terminal or some file? Is it because of Tails? Will the recent 12.1 update save me? Please help guys, I'm not a big fan of my MAC address being leaked
