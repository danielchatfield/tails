A *useful* variation on what's been suggested could be something presented as follows:

    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    Hash: SHA256
    
    File:      tails-i386-0.12.iso
    MD5SUM:    blahblahblah
    TIGER:     blahblahblahblahblahblah
    SHA256:    blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah
    WHIRLPOOL: blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah
    
    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
    iQA/A2UBN48ob3S9RCOKzo55EQKhDACg1NV2/iyPKrDiOVJ4Jwz6orcQ0U2AnjNC
    CDxKAFyahGa8i5l1v2bFkAJk
    =3r/N
    -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

It'd be quick and easy to authenticate, allow users to choose the hash they use and possibly provide a greater degree of security by using multiple unrelated hash functions.

Before anyone remarks. Why Whirlpool? Not everyone outside the US blindly trusts the NSA's own stinking MD5 family. Providing an alternative would be harmless for those who do and invaluable for those who don't.

...and yes, a pgp signature would *have* to be based on an MD5 derivative digest but please calculate the probability of finding an exploitable collision in such a brief, predictably formatted message and compare it to the chances of there being such a collision in the hash of >700MB of arbitrary binary data before remarking.

Before anyone remarks. Why Tiger? No, it *isn't* broken. MD5 is broken but Tiger is not. What it is is small, different in design and *astoundingly* fast.
