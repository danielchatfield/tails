I know there are weaknesses with MD5SUMs but most people don't know how to verify with PGP (even with your confusing instructions). I can bet that there are a lot of tails CDs being downloaded and used without ANY verification at all! A simple MD5 or SHA256 would provide something at least instead of nothing at all.
