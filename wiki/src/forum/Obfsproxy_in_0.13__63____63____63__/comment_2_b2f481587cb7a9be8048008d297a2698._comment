>Where have you read this?

I've searched and searched but can't find the source... I thought it was from either the Tails mailing list, a Tor mailing list or the Tor blog. Not having any browser history it's rather difficult to re-trace my footsteps. ;-) Must have been a simple slip or typo or something.

>Tails 0.13 will also stay with Tor 0.2.2. It is the next major release that is most likely to include Tor 0.2.3 and use its stream isolation features.

Fair enough... not too much longer to wait then! :D

>Sure, we want to include obfsproxy. But someone needs to do the workâ€¦ Will you do it?

What work is required exactly?

I'm sure I read, while fruitlessly searching for my last reference, that Tails is to switch to the Tor Browser Bundle. Is this correct? (PLEASE don't ask me to track down the source if it's not!)

If TBB *is* to be used, couldn't Tails just use the version which includes Obfsproxy as available from [the Obfsproxy page](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en)?

It *sounds* on the Obfsproxy page like the TBB+Obfsproxy bundle *just works*<sup>TM</SUP>:

>We've made an experimental package that currently works in all censored countries with no config changes. 

Have I got the wrong end of the stick (again)? :(
