>It sounds on the Obfsproxy page like the TBB+Obfsproxy bundle just worksTM:

I can confirm that the Obfsproxy TBB \"just works\". In fact I'm using the bundle to post this. The connection I'm using is aggressively firewalled against Tor, so it's impossible for me to establish any internet connection at all with Tails.

I didn't even need to edit the config. The warning to the contrary on the TODO:Obfsproxy page must be obsolete. I'll update it now.
