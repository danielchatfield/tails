"Most additional applications you may install will be routed through
Tor, but some of them may fiddle with the network configuration and
change firewall rules, and that might result in them leaking out of
Tor."

Without using Wireshark or related tools, why not change the value of

"WarnUnsafeSocks"

from 0 to 1 inside /etc/tor/torrc ?

This would warn the user if a program is trying to dick around in a way it shouldn't within Tails.
