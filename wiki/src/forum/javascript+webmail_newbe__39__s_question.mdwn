i understand that it's very recommended to disable javascript.
i want to register a webmail ,but most of i tried need javascript enabled.
so what shod i do? keep searching for webmail that doesn't need javascript enabled? or is there some way to circumvent javascript problem in this situation (extra layer? firewall restriction?.......anything?) 
what option do i have if i don't trust webmail,i'm not worry about content of the e-mail since will be encrypted,only my anonymity.

any help it's very appreciated

other thing i don't understand:
  
  i was riding in some threads here that some mail keeps ip logs so it's better not using them.
  if i understand well, the logs they'll have will be of exit node ip , so i will be "safe", right?


sorry for my english, and thanks for any help
