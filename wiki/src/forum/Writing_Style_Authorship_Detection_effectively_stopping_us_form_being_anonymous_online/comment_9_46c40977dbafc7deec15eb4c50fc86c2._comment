> Nothing on the internet is absolutely, 100% untraceable. (And if anyone claims otherwise, it's a sure sign not to trust him.)

I realize that but I wanted to keep my explanation somewhat simple so I didn't feel like getting into complicated topics like TOR privacy attacks.

> What Tor can do, according to the official documentation (and, of course, when used properly and prudently), is to make connecting one's identity to one's net traffic highly difficult, costly and, in most cases at least, impractical.


I'd say that calling the tracking \"impractical\" is a bit of an understatement, while I admit that TOR is not 100% secure (literally no software is) it is designed in such a way that tracking someone is practically impossible, to the point where I strongly doubt that anyone that aren't the direct enemy of several governments would ever be in danger of getting tracked through TOR.
