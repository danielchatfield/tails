Please view this youtube video. Very interesting. I know it's long. It's 60 minutes. More than the average person willing to concentrate and watch.

You can hide to some degree if you change your writing style. I doesn't help much! And the current detection techniques are just the beginning!

There are so many techniques to detect an author. While you can obfuscate one value you mess up another one.

I think in one or two years they have indexed all forum and blog posts and if they are looking for someone they just run it through the detection processor. Posting online will only be possible in a really messed up language. At least this is my conclusion after watching the video.
