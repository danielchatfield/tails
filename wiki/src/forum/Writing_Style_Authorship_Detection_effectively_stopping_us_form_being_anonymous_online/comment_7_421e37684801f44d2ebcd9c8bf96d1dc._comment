>TOR, I2P and FREENET are examples of networks that are not Clearnets as everything you do on those networks are encrypted and untracable.

*Nothing* on the internet is absolutely, 100% *untraceable*. (And if anyone claims otherwise, it's a sure sign not to trust him.)

What Tor can do, according to the official documentation (and, of course, when used properly and prudently), is to make connecting one's identity to one's net traffic highly difficult, costly and, in most cases at least, impractical.
