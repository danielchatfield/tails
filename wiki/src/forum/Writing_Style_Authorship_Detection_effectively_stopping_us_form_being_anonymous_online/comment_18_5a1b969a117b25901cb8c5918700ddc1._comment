\"Nothing on the internet is absolutely, 100% untraceable.\"

  How would someone with a spoofed MAC online via a broken into WiFi be traced? Especially if it's a brief one time connection. I'll allow you to utilize as much resources as a most pressing need would demand ( e.g. an imminent nuclear terrorism attack , tracing a killer of a prominent political figure, tracing world's No.1 wanted etc.) .
