I feel I must warmly endorse this most salubrious of recommendations. I am utterly unequivocal in my conviction that such endeavours would bestow an altogether more enjoyable reading experience upon the internet. However any author, no matter how erudite, would indubitably retain a quantifiable inclination toward a particular subset of the corpus lexicographical. Furthermore, that authorâ€™s writing style, personality, knowledge and interests would remain distinct to that individual and apparent to the reader. Therefore while I do, in a general context, most enthusiastically endorse this ineffable aspiration, I must interject that it may be of dishearteningly little worth to this particular topic of discourse.
