> Could someone explain in greater detail what \"clearnet\" means?

Clearnet is a term often used on privacy forums to refer to any network where what you do is send unencrypted and can be traced back to you. 

It is usually used as a synonym for the normal web as all of the things you do normally on the web can easily be monitored and traced back to you, TOR, I2P and FREENET are examples of networks that are not Clearnets as everything you do on those networks are encrypted and untracable.

So in other words OP was basically just saying that everyone has posted at least one comment to one normal web side while not using TOR,I2P,FREENET,etc.
