@8:

1.) I said where in the **TAILS** documentation. Since when does the `wget` manual answer the question of whether `wget` is safe to use while running **TAILS**?!

2.) If the question is not answered in the TAILS documentation, and no TAILS dev answers the question in the forum, then how could anyone other than the rare expert in this area know?

They can't. But it's pretty obvious that you're just getting off on being obnoxious and condescending; basically trolling, so I should really stop feeding you.
