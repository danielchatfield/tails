>to be sure an exit node has not poisoned the download

Let's say someone downloaded a RAR or 7zip file containing a video. Extracting it seems to go fine, and the video plays as expected.

I'm guessing that it's still possible for the file to have actually been malicious in some way. But how? I.e., what are some of the ways that extracting and then playing such a file could exploit and harm?
