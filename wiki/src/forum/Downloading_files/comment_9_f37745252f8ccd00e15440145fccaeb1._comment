@ Commentator 8:

> Incredible how you just assume that the \"TAILS devs\" have nothing better to do than loiter around this forum awaiting every trivial opportunity to hold your hand.

I think you should read this page: <https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/help/>

In case you missed the point: experienced Tails users can help out by answering questions in the forum or IRC chat, since this helps the developers devote more time to coding, researching, and documenting.

The man page for wget does not explain how to use wget with torify, nor does it address the potential problems of using wget with torify, which is what I think Commentator 6 was asking for.

@ Anyone who wants to experiment:

Something like 

torify wget -c -t 5 --limit-rate=20k http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.13/tails-i386-0.13.iso

should get the iso image via a Tor circuit (adjust the rate limit if you expect your Tor circuit to have more bandwidth), but I don't know whether this is really safe.  One problem might be that if the download is interrupted and wget must retry (as will probably happen), some information might leak.  In fact, the man page for torify warns that ICMP messages will probably leak, which I think means that torify wget does NOT provide truly anonymous downloading.

This may be a question only the Tails developers can answer (unless someone knows of a Tor Talk post which provides a good answer).
