>Is torified wget necessary for anonymity?

wget in TAILS is torified-- but so is the native system of downloading within Iceweasel. So I don't know if one is any safer than the other.

wget in a regular distro is NOT torified and hence would be no more anonymous than any other non-torified, non-proxied download method.
