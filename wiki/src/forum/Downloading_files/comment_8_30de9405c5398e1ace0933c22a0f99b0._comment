\"an official statement from a TAILS dev\" is **not** necessary

>Incredible how you just assume that the OP of this thread and/or comment 2 didn't bother to search before posting-- when you yourself acknowledge the lack of an authoratative answer to the questions said posters asked.

Incredible how you just assume that the \"TAILS devs\" have nothing better to do than loiter around this forum awaiting every trivial opportunity to hold your hand.

Do you also demand they come to your house to cut up your dinner? Check under your bed for monsters?
