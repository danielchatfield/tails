>I assume that the player in TAILS would protect against this?

I don't remember *any* FOSS video player *ever* doing this by default. Only the player the Microsoft Corporation bundles into its OS.

Not that it'd really matter if the Totem devs suddenly decided to borrow this leaf or two of evil from Microsoft's book. The (doesn't happen in Tails) pop-up would be routed over Tor anyway ;o)
