I have experimented with torified wget while using Wireshark, and didn't spot any obvous red flags.  But such a test is probably worth little without using another machine with two networks to sniff packets on your LAN (assuming you legally administer it, of course).

I guess that ICMP packets might be a source of information leakage.

There is some outdated information at torproject.org which you can try to find, but I never found it very useful.
