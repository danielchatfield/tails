>Seems to me like a symbiotic relationship would ensue if the two entitites merged.

Symbiotic but not synonymous:

Tails is a distribution project not a software project. The project assembles appropriate packages in a manner useful to its users. It produces very little actual code.

Conversely Tor is a software research project. It produces an application not an OS.

There's actually surprisingly little *overlap* between the projects.

Many people use Tor software in other OSs and many Tails users choose Tails for features other than Tor - some never even connect Tails to a network.

I think the relationship is ideal as it is. A symbiosis of two projects each focussed on what they're good at.
