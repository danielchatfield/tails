Hi, there. Thank you very much for this wonderful tool.

I have a couple of problems booting TAILS.

If I use a version 0.9 or 0.10 ISO downloaded from your site under VirtualBox (as virtual CD), I get an "Unable to read boot device" error. Some of the sectors in the ISO file seem to be unreadable. The same happens when I burn these files to a physical CD-ROM, but in these cases the boot process continues until it shows an X login prompt!
The strange thing is that these same ISO files used from a USB stick work perfectly ok.

I have built my own release from git sources, and the ISO obtained also shows an X login prompt when booting as CD, and no login when booting as USB media. Any explanation for this?

(The signatures of the downloaded files were checked, and everything was correct)

Thanks a lot!
