Amnesia Branding Iceweasel Add-on - updates itself each boot?

I checked Iceweasel's addons and noticed updates were set to automatic when visiting the
Extensions Add-ons Manager window. I disabled the automatic updates. I clicked on Recent
Updates and amnesia branding gets updated with each new boot. The same information is
listed when you go to the Extensions area and click on More where amnesia branding
is located, once double clicked it shows the Last Updated date as the current date,
the same date in which you booted Tails.

What is amnesia branding?

What is its purpose in Tails?

Why is it auto updating?

Can it safely be removed?
