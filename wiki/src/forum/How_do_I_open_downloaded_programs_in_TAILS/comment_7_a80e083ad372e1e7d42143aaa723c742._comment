I'd like to grab my program called craigs mailer, I got it from a friend.  Its a super mailer.  So I can send out emails to my subscribers, but it's got a lot of features that other mailers dont have.  

I downloaded it from the web while inside TAILS/debian/TOR.  I downloaded it to the desktop, looks like a brown box.  I extracted it to the desktop too, it looks like a gray folder.  Then when I click it, it brings up a file browser with 2 files, a chilkdot.dll and craigsmailer.exe.  Now when I click on craigsmailer.exe it brings up a box with three names .reloc .rsrc .text.  Why doesn't it just start the program?  

BTW, the craigsmailer.exe has a different icon than what appears in vista.  IN debian the icon is a purple square.  In vista the icon is an actual logo for the program.

hmm, can someone walk me through this, possibly?  :)

Why in the world am I having so much trouble installing a silly program?  a little help is needed  :)
