I think I'm basically trying to do this-->
http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Software-in-Debian-Linux

Here's my steps I've been trying-->
>I open Terminal
>I type su
>I type sudo
>I type apt-get install proxy multiply
>It says--> E: could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), are you root?


I just want to install Proxy Multiply inside debian/TAILS

Why am I getting that error, btw, I'm no Linux expert.  Tips?
