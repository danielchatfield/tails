In Debian/Tails I went to terminal, typed sudo apt-get install stellarium, typed admin password. It says \"reading package DONE\" and \"Reading static info DONE\" and \"E: unable to locate package stellarium\"

Soo, is the program just not available anymore, or is it trying to pull it from E:, or what am I doing wrong, why can't I download a program?

I want to install a program that I use on Vista.  I want it inside debian/TAILS...
