You have trouble because you are trying to use a *Windows* program on a *Linux* system. This does not work out-of-the-box.

Try installing Wine first, it should do exactly what you need: run Windows .exe files on Tails

To install Wine, be sure to set the root password and then write into the terminal:
> sudo apt-get update
then press enter. Type the password and press enter again. Wait until it downloads some stuff.

If you get \"authenticaton failure\" many times, you're probably victim of a known bug. Write:
> killall x-session-manager
and press enter. You will be back to the welcome screen, set the password again and retry.

When the \"apt-get update\" command finishes, type:
> sudo apt-get install wine
and press enter. Wait until it donwloads and installs Wine. You will probably need to configure it a little, too.

When Wine is installed, you should be able to use your program.

Hope it helps
