Back in the days of black and white Macintoshes there was a game that had "Boss coming!" on the menu bar.  If you clicked it the game would switch to a fake spread sheet.  That would be better then using the power off, panic button.  You'd probibly want it to be activated by a hot key or by moving the mouse to a certain place on the screen, say the bottom left corner.  Since security is an issue you might also consider adding an optional password when returning from the boss screen.  

Another thing I've been thinking about is shutting down when using XP camouflage.  It becomes really obvious that you're not using Windows if someone sees a bunch of text on the screen. Hiding all that behind some type of Windows Shutting Down screen would be safer.

What do you think?
