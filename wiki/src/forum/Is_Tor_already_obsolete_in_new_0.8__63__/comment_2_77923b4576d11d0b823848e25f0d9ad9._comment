thanks tails!!

but...im just confused...

im running the latest tails...which says im running tor 0.2.2.33-1....but the latest tor is 0.2.2.34-1????????

so you are saying that latest bug only applies to the browser bundle? but ive checked all the other packages,right up until the expert package and they are all version 0.2.2.34-1..which is above the one im currently running on tails..

cheers
