I don't think Tor wants you to upgrade; rather, check.torproject.org, due to a known bug, thinks you are using the Tor Browser Bundle, which you are not when you are using Tails. So you don't have to worry about this scary, buggy message. A workaround for this problem, on our side, is ready to be shipped in the upcoming Tails point-release, planned for Real Soon Now.

To know the version of Tor you are using in Tails, you can run `dpkg -s tor`, or read the release notes ([[news]]) for the version of Tails you are running.
