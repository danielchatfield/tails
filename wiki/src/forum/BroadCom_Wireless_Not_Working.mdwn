I'm running Tails from a USB card on my HP Netbook 1030NR.  It has a Broadcom wireless module.  This does not seem to be supported on the current Trails build.  How can I enable it?  The drivers should be readily available.  NOTE: I am not a regular Linux user, so please keep it simple if you can.

Many thanks!!
