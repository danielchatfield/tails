Inner city area gsm can be pinpointed to 50-100meters , outer city area 500m-1.5km , no city area 1.5-5km or above depending on location of gsm towers. This is what the emergency services have told to the public in newspapers on how they can trace peoples cell phones in emergencies. not all gsm towers transmit 3g data, so 3g will be harder to trace (personal opionion not fact). 

Anyway in all cases that have had gsm trace on to save human life the rescue services have not been able to find the victim without being in communication with him/her telling them where they hear helicopter sounds, dog barks, telling what the area is looking like etc. this data is from a small high tech socialist country that takes police work very seriously.

So all in all the gsm/3g trace is pretty worthless with todays technology. It can be made to prove wich city you are in and what area of it, but if somebody wants to find you with it, it will be VERY hard. Ofcourse you should get your modem(s) and computer anonymously. And change location from time to time. If you have a large private property or farm it might be not the smartest thing to connect from there. be aware of profiling.

Tempest van ? I also heard tinfoil helps only if you cover yourself completely with it to stop mind reading. I dont know how things are in the STATES but in general the authorities are not gods who know everything.

4g might be more accurate as it can pass thru stuctures better and has stronger signal.

for what it's worth I still believe Tails+tor is the strongest link in protecting your privacy but if it fails (wich it never has for me) it's good to have a back up, a prepaid internet with crap localisation is not bad back up to have.
