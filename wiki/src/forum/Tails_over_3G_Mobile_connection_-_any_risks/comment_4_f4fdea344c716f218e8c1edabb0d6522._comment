Sorry, cannot tell. I know that certain phones are not so good at protecting their IMEI so they can be reflashed relatively easily. If I was you, I would not do that - as I already explained it's illegal to do that. 
You'd probably get into more trouble when caught changing the IMEI than caught using Tor to do bad stuff. 
If you REALLY want to have fully anonymous Internet link, find a coffee shop with open Wifi and no cameras. Or just use your 3g modem no more than 3 times and afterwards sell it off to someone who doesn't care about its past and won't contact you if anything goes wrong. Either way, it will be harder to track you down.
