I think this subject hasn't received the attention that it deserves. IF THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

 TOR is going to provide you with little security once there is a TEMPEST van parked outside your house, a 5c bug planted in your computer, timing attacks aimed at every contact you have on your mobile phone or make contact with. I feel just as threatened by my location data as i do by the content of internet activity.  So how to stop this? Well as pointed out the government has made it very difficult!  you become a criminal if dare to require anonynimity and remove the IMEI. Yes you can roam wireless devices or internet cafe's but this is impractical for the majority of people. Lets face it, we live in a survelliance world and most people don't realise that they carry a tracking device around with them 24/7 called a mobile phone. Government computers track every move and next time you end up in court you best remember exactly where you were because they will.

 I am looking into satellite phones and and their anon features. LEO telephones utilizes LEO (low Earth orbitan altitude of 640 to 1120 kilometers ) satellite technology. The advantages include providing worldwide wireless coverage with no gaps. LEO systems have the ability to track a mobile unit's location using doppler shift calculations from the satellite.However, this method may be inaccurate, and is probably irrelivant due to your phone's gps.

 satellites in geostationary orbit, which are meant to remain in a fixed position in the sky altitude of about 35,000 kilometres and I imagine the doppler shift calculations be quite a bit more difficult. There have been reports of terrorists using Thuraya Geo phones with the GPS \"Spoofed\" to communicate without the unwelcome addition of a guided missile through your window. 

I'm not sure how difficult it would be to find or make one of those but I would sure like to find out!

I understand that an individual with a radio tracker can triangulate your position with accuracy given enough time. Even so, I think this may be one step off the radar as there are no towers involved like your mobile GSM and someone would have to take an interest first, ie a computer can't do on mass. Also you could hide in a large city perhaps masked by the multitude of radio emmissions and move quickly while your calling. 

Such a system could be used with tails to great effect. If anyone has any information about this i would very much like to know
