And the 3G technology keeps track of your exact localisation, so it's perhaps worse than other solutions, like macchange + open wifi access (please notice that macchange and wifi is quite tricky: it's hard to know if your *real wifi card mac adress* is not leaked during the computer boot, so before it's \"macchanged\")

Is it possible, and how?
