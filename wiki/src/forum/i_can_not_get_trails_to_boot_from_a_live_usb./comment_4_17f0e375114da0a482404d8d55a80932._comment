The only supported methods for installing Tails to a USB drive at the moment are the following:

* [[Linux|doc/installing_onto_a_usb_stick/linux]]
* [[Windows|doc/installing_onto_a_usb_stick/windows]]

Any other method may simply not work (like it did for you) or cause bugs ([[example|forum/tail_0.10_live_on_usb_ask_me_for_user_and_password]]) so beware.

We're currently working on a [[custom USB installer/upgrader|todo/usb_install_and_upgrade]]. Stay tuned...
