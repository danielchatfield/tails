I suppose I could have made the Tails connection more clear.  Let me try to rectify that now.

The defining characteristic of Tails is that it tries to provide an *amnesiac* operating system.

This implicitly raises a question for discussion on the Tails forum: *what can you do with an amenesiac operating system?*

I am trying to suggest how by live-installing some small packages from the Debian repositories, the range of things Tails can do can be expanded.  Since I have a particular interest in trying to help endangered netizens (which happens to a be stated goal of the USG affiliate quasi-governmental agency which funds the Tails Project), it is natural that I should post suggestions relevant to the needs of that audience.
