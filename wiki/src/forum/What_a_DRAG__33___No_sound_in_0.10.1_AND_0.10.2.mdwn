I have tried to figure out what is wrong to no avail. No sound in ANY application within tails.Nor any online(YouTube etc)

No options in system preferences either.Just "HD Audio-generic[Alsa]" With no ability to modify, excepting switches in volume control<preferences. "Sound Theme" is grayed out.

Is this "just the way it is" in Tails? Anyone else having same frustrations?

Other than that, Tails is THE POO! Long Live you geniuses that put it together! :)
