Are older versions available to download on the site; specifically 0.10.2? I know it's outdated and 0.11 is better but I simply do not have CDs that can take the current Tails larger size. 

If there is, can someone please link me to it? I would much rather download previous versions directly from this site than some untrustworthy file sharing site.

Thanks in advance.
