>To unclutter the GUI 

What \"clutter\"? The add-on bar is completely *empty* now! The ABP icon would be the *only thing* in the add-on bar. 

And even if each add-on included in TAILS has its own icon in the add-on bar, there would still be plenty of room. Plus, the add-on bar is easily hidden from view and toggled with Ctrl+/. (and, IIRC correctly, hidden from default)

I just can't understand that you would go out of your way to change the default of the ABP icon appearing in the add-on bar. Can't see what possible advantage this offers, only negative.
