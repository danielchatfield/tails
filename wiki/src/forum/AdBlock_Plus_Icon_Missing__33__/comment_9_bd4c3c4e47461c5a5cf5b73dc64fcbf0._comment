> is there any way to get the AdBlock plus icon back?

As we wrote early in July, we prefer to hide this icon by
default, and \"we did not find an easy way to hide it otherwise\".

Facts: nobody on the Tails team found it important enough, since
this was asked, to make it so those who really want it can
display the AdBlock Plus icon. I doubt our individual and
collective priorities will change much on this topic any time
soon. I'm sorry, but repeatedly asking, without providing much of
new and/or convincing arguments, is unlikely to convince anyone
to spend their time implementing this.

Therefore, I suggest those who *do* find it important enough to
be able to display the AdBlock Plus icon [[provide
a way|contribute/how/code]] to do it, while keeping it hidden
by default.
