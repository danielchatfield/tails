\"Comment #12\"  and \"commnet # 13\": 
Did you read comment 15?

@Comments 16 and 17:  I'm afraid that I find what was written in \"comment #14\" to be quite applicable to both of you.

I wonder whether you even bothered to read comment 15, etc.

Your posts suggest a disturbing cult-like devotion to the TAILS devs that clouds your perspective and does not allow you to see how clearly germane, cogent and coherent the relevant posts in this thread are.  (even if somewhat verbose and redundant)
