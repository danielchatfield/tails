I agree with many of the previous posts ITT; the indifference and arrogance shown by TAILS wrt to this issue is extremely disappointing and disturbing.

Also, last I checked the Tor Browser Bundle did *not* come with AdBlock Plus. Perhaps TBB should include ABP or perhaps TAILS should *not* include ABP but it should be one of the two, no? How can it be good for the browser in TAILS to differ that much from TBB?
