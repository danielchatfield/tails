Recently this board has been plagued by a troll who writes
interminably long, nit-picking, attention-seeking, often
condescending and insulting posts. I would rather that the devs
spent their time developing rather than being side-tracked by some
twit with too much time on his hands who wishes to have the devs'
full attention as he waxes long and lyrical about a missing icon and
demands an authoritative reply on every tedious, pettifogging point.

His behaviour, if unintentional, is neurotic, and if intentional
amounts to trolling.
