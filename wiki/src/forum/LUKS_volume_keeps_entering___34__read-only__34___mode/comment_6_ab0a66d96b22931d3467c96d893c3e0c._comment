The only thing I did recently to the drive was copying some data from a Truecrypt drive to the LUKS drive.  I do that from time to time with no problems.  As for the cable, it is fine, although my USB slots on my machine are in bad shape, but my Truecrypt drives still work fine.  I think I will reformat the drive then back my data on to it.
