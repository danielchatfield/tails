Doesn't make sense. If you know how to, try using command line instead. Filesystem check is done with \"fsck\", see \"man fsck\" for usage.

Nice :)

If the SMART data indicated multiple read-errors, the causes can be many. For example it can happen due to age or wear. In my case the damage was on the disk already when I bought it, but didn't trigger until it tried to write data to the damaged section.

What comment 4 says is also possible causes regardless of whether SMART data indicates any error or not.
