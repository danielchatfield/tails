Yes it is an external hdd. Thanks for the advice. When i try to use the check filesystem it needs to contact the internet. I dont know if it will go through tor or not. As for the backup, i have my data on no less than 3 drives and i am thinking about adding a #4. I wonder what could have caused the damage.
