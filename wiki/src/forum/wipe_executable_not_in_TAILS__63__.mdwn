Using TAILS, I noticed that the wipe executable was missing.

Shouldn't wipe be available to the common TAILS user?  If not, why not?

The use case for having the wipe executable in TAILS is that when you download and save a file on a USB, and later want to wipe it, you cannot currently do it in TAILS because the wipe executable  is missing in the TAILS distribution.

Note: this is while using TAILS 0.13~rc1.
