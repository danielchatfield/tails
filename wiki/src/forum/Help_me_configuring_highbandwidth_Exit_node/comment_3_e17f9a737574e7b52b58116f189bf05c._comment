Tails is nothing without i2p and TOR netowrk.  The mere contribution of Tails is that it ships some heavy software to give TOR and i2p a look of complete operting system. But don't forget that without TOR and i2p you are gone!

If I create an Exit node, your users too will get benefited. There is no forum for TOR and that's why people ask you for it here, otherwise your users are but a few due to heavy operating system one needs to download.

I have seen that you do not allow the visitors asking questions on i2p and TOR which is completely a wrong thing. In this way, you are prejudicing the interests of your own users as well.
