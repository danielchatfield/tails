Tails doesn't support EXit node, but thrives on using the exits of others!

I have to keep the system running in my office forever with the exit node and I am doing all this for all the users (including me) who have used Tails, TOR and i2p for years without doing anything for them. Now that I got an opportunity to do something for the people, you are discouraging me.

Does TOR discriminates against TAILS? No. On the contrary they update their users about TAILS releases and also post it on their official blog. Don't be unfaithful, dear TAILS team.
