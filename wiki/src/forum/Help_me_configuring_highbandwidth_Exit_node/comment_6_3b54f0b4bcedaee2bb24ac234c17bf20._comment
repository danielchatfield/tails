My corporate has written of a computer from its books and has consigned the obsolete computer to the store/junk room and it will be auctions with all the written off material in August 2013. So this computer is now not on record. I have plugged a piece of cable from the window and connected it to internet connection to run the Exit Node in it.

No liability can be cast and it can't be seized by anyone because no one can trace it and no one can even imagine that a computer in the junk store is running exit node and that too unofficially off the record with the cable plugged from the small wall window opening onto the storage room.

I thought it would be good because out of 230 computers of my corporation, it will not be traceable as it is no one's custody.

If someone can help me, please give me the procedure. It could be of some help to some users.
