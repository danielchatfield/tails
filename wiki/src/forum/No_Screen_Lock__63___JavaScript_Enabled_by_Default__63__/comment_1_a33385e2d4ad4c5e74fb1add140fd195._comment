screen lock: considering Tails user account's password is public, I think providing means to \"lock\" the screen to users is likely to make them falsely believe it would work. Advanced users who want to lock the screen and know how to change the password will also be able to install gnome-screensaver, I guess.

JavaScript: just like the Tor Browser Bundle, we rely on Torbutton to protect against many kinds of attacks against anonymity that can be conducted through JS. Tails previously shipped with JS disabled by default, with NoScript allowing to opt-in, and it seems most users did not know how to enable it when needed / make reasonable decisions on this topic so it seemed better to do the current compromise. See the [[related todo item|todo/iceweasel_addon_-_NoScript]] for details.
