Either someone was off their meds or was smoking some good green when they added this to the above entry:

\"If the 'Why' of ourselves is 'chemistry, a dance with time into infinity' (a natural regenerative system amongst the permutations of the fundamental laws of chemical reactions? the physicists I think are looking into the nature and why of matter itself!), If the 'What' of ourselves is happiness, the joy in our lives (if you are not sure here can I suggest looking at the science (and philosophy) of happiness, it's still a young science so it takes a some rummaging around, but the answer is t/here I think - certain things add joy and happiness to our lives, and for good reason as well - we have genetically evolved this way: a feeling of fear ensures our survival in the face of hazards, however the feeling of happiness guides our behaviour in more general contexts towards those activities which have ensured the success of our species over the past millenia and up to the present day (so if our role and purpose in the scheme of things is happiness, no more, no less, as simple as that, please do not take away from the joy in our lives!)), As to the 'How' of ourselves, the ingredients are there, Life's Menu is up to us; I completed a poem recently, titled 'Mountains in the Mist' (this was what I was looking at at the time), it has only one line: 'One day, when we understand ourselves, ' - it is up to you to say, following the trailing comma, what life will be like one day when we understand the things about ourselves that we currently do not. So sleep well, dream of good and great things, and use Clay Shirky's cognitive surplus to add some joy and happiness to Life's Menu and the lives of people - they, and you, only have one.\"

Awesome, I guess.
