it seems that google has most tor-exitnodes blacklisted likely because of any kind of abuse... (i dont think they generally block tor, i think its only nodes which acted in a bad manner)

is there a way to trick or workaround for the sorry-sites to which google redirects you in case of a blocked exitnode?

you probably know already the 2 types of sorry pages of google. the one which lets you do nothing but trying to reconnect with another node-circle because access is totally blocked. and the other one, which lets you enter a captures and you be able again to use google.

im not a google friend but for now im to much uses to it ...

is there a possibility accessing google without all the stress of reconnecting? i know some web-proxies and dont trust this proxies... or maybe a metasearch with google implemented.

have a nice.
bye!
