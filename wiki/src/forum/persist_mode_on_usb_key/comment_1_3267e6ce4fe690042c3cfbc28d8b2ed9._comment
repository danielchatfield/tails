There is currently no persistence support in tails. This is an item on our todo list, but you can imagine it's a tricky one, and need to be implemented correctly.

We don't install tails on usb using unetbootin, so we can't advise you so much on this.

Be aware that anything you put on our usb key will be in clear text and readable to anyone who can.

If you want to have the right language, you can try to add \"locales=EN\" and \"keyboard-layouts=EN\" (replace EN by your language string) in the kernel command-line in syslinux

Sometimes the \"cat tails.iso > /dev/sdX\" does not work, mostly because of bad usb keys. Maybe try on another one.
