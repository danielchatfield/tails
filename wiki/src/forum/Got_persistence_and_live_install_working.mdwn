A spot of random positive feedback: thanks to those who helped here with two problems I have had which I seem to have now overcome.

* Using Tails 0.15 booted from the DVD, simply by starting synaptic I can live install a few small utilities I like, which is awesome.  It seems that the download is even torified properly.

* Have been able to create an encrypted USB drive for persistence.  I find that I may need to click "remove safely" twice before the drive is really unmounted and safely removeable.  But I've been able to write and read just fine.

It's a bit clunky but if I don't boot Tails too often I think it's workable.

So thanks again to the developers for all their hard work on Tails!
