Before you start the network, if you have set a root password in the start up sequence of TAILS, you can issue the following root command to set the UTC time:

    date -u MMDDhhmm

where MM is 01-12 for month, DD is day from 01-31, hh is hour from 00-23, and mm is minute from 00-59, and UTC is relative to your timezone.

Then the synchronization when the network is started should take only a very short while compared to not setting the UTC manually which usually takes a lot longer to sync.
