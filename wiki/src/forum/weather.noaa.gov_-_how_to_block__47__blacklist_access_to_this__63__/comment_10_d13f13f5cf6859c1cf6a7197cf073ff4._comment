>Setting location and changing time to anything other than utc is an erosion of anonymity! Please please read the tor docs, tails docs. TL;DR changing location and time settings is a bad idea, use a watch!

Tor *requires* I set the clock by location and confirm at the bottom right hand side of the time/date dropdown area with my root password.

If I do not set the location, all times (hwclock && date && date -u) are listed as the same and Tor gives me the error that my time has jumped and in previous versions it would end there preventing my use of Tor.

Once location is set and the correct time is confirmed Tor does not give me this time jumped warning/halt.

I follow with removal of the clock applet from the panel and the problem is solved with a quick killall gnome-panel which stops the panel from trying to connect to a .gov address as expressed in polipo's log file.
