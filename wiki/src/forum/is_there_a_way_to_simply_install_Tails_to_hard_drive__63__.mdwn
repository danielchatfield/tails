i am somewhat new to linux.  have succeeded in booting up a liveUSB tails, but am interested in having the whole package simply downloaded to a partition.

i realize that it would be possible to look at the 'features' included, and download-install each individual package to replicate a non-live standalone, but that would certainly take awhile.

~thank you~
