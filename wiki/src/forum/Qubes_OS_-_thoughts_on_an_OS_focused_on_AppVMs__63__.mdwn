Qubes released 1.0 last week and I thought having something like that would be very cool to work with from a Tails viewpoint - From the website:

>No! This would not make much sense. Qubes uses VMs to create security domains, such as e.g. ‘work’, ‘personal’, ‘banking’, etc. Typical user would likely need around 5 domains. Very paranoid users, who are high-profile targets. might use around a dozen domains.

The worst part is that there's doesn't appear to be a LiveOS so that's out of the picture for the forseeable future. The benefits Tails could obtain from this are seperate domains for Tor, Opennet, I2P, all using the same modem.
