> I'll never start i2p again, what about you?

Don't I2P project leaders engage in the same type of doublespeak that Tor leaders do? I.e., pretending that illegal activities represent only a minor part of the network userbase, yada yada? It's pathetic, but it obviously helps their Puritan morale, so you might find listening to similar rhetoric useful to soothe your desire to control what other people do. I mean, politicians in western countries have convinced people that looking at CP is a crime against humanity and should be punished by many years in prison, but that happened because children are always a good way to promote one's political career, not because such severe punishment is effective or makes sense. After all, there is research showing that accessibility of pornography prevents rape, why wouldn't that work for child pornography and prevention of pedophilia? Unless people actually pay for CP, I don't see a major issue, and even if they do pay, the punishment is probably still disproportional. I don't see a similar outrage when clips of actual murders are available online, for instance, and some sites even charge for subscription to grant access to such material (TheYNC is one, I think).

Anyway, to your original question: I do value my privacy more than inability of some people to view or exchange CP. I would go as far as to say that I don't care what they do. Moreover, your real values are probably similar, but you were taught that you should pretend otherwise. Try to distance yourself from something that was recently disturbing, and think about similar distant issues objectively. For instance, on 9/11, it was reported that the terrorists used PGP to communicate. Immediately, voices that tools like PGP should not be developed or made publicly available received wide support, and this didn't happen on Fox news, mind you, but on Slashdot. Silly, isn't it?
