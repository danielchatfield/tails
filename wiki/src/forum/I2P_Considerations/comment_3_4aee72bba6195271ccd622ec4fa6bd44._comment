[I'm OP]
Happy to see intelligent comments like the first one, I'm open to people thinking different to me, it's a chanche to grow and exchange points of view.

I know censorship is one of the biggest problems regarding our freedom and there are big prices to pay for freedom but I (maybe it's not the same for you) can't protect my privacy or gather my speech freedom with i2p knowing that while using this method some CP material can be shared through my computer. If I use PGP to encrypt messages I can't feel responsable if one uses PGP to organize terroristic attacks, there's no connection, and so must not PGP programmers (and i2p ones) but if I forward some encrypted messages used to orgaize a terroristic attack then I feel somehow responsable, even more if I know that the encrypted message I forwarded could have contained something like that. Again, it's only a personal thought.
I also know that crimes against children have been oversized in importance and punishment by the current society but I have an 8 years old sister and I really get angry when I see some CP, really, maybe I'm the product of this society, but believe me, it's hard to see things objectively when a situation is about your personal life.
I didn't know pornography helped preventing rapes (actually it sounds somehow logical, I'll read something about that, it's interesting) but the distance between child pornography and pedophilia isn't that big, wolud you really justify child pornography with that? Sorry but I can't.

>Please STFU.
You can criticize my opinions and I'm happy about that but you should respect who thinks different from you, please keep this in mind.

>No-one is forcing you to look at cp on i2p
No one is forced to look at CP on i2p but you are forced to let CP (not only CP, that's obvious) pass through your computer and that's the point, I won't use i2p if even one kb of CP will be forwarded through me. I'm not pretending you to do like me, I was just wondering what other peolple thought because not everyone knows about that.

P.s.
>I susdpect you've looked at quite a bit in your \"horror\" and now are trying to justify yourself.
You don't know me so don't judge me, please.
