To OP: No-one is forcing you to look at cp on i2p or anywhere else, so don't. I susdpect you've looked at quite a bit in your \"horror\" and now are trying to justify yourself.  A large percentage of adult males are capable of being sexuallu aroused by children, get used to it.  Both the type of cp around and its supposed damaging effects are hugely overestimated anyway.  If that can be tracked or censored, so can everything else.  That is the price of freedom.  Please STFU.
