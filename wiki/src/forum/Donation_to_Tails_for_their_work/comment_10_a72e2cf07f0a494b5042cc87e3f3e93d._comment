I'd recommend a bounty system where funds are dispersed based in relationship to the work done to integrate the specific projects.
Possibly using a Pledge system, where the developer/s can include their BTC addresses on the wiki pages for completed integrations.
I'll pay 5 BTC if this gets implemented and wiki'd.
