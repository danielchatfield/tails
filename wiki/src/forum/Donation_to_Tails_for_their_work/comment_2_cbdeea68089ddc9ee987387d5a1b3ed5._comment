There are already [threads](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Would_financial_contributions_help__63___I_see_no_way_to_donate./) about [this](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Donation__63__/) already. Can't you search?

...and yes I agree it would be nice (not least to compensate them for this @#%&$ing forum!) but don't forget that setting up such a thing is *more work*! I find it heartening that [other demands](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html) are given higher priority.
