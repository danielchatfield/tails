Also, Downthemall! does not appear to present an *accounting*/financial statement to the public. 

This, unfortunately, seems to be true for many, if not most, other projects as well. I don't know about TrueCrypt or Debian. In the case of Debian, I would think that a project of that size and stature would disclose financial statements to the public but I haven't looked into it yet. 

In previous threads on the topic of TAILS accepting donations, there were posts expressing the hope that TAILS will provide full transparency, should they start taking donations.
