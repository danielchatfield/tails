Or you can just burn Tails on cd. Start it, plug in your pendrive and go: Applications->Tails->Tails USB Installer-> Clone&Install. Choose your pendrive in \"target device\" and and hit \"create live USB\".

In fact this is the only method that works for me with Tails 0.12. I've got \"no system detected\" or something like that when creating Tails usb with Universal USB Installer.
