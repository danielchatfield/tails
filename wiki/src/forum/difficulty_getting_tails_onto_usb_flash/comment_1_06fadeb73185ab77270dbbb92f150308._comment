Windows, OSX? I doubt you're using Linux.

If using windows, download the universal USB installer. Run the exe file and follow the instructions.

When completed, reboot your pc and hit a key to enter the bios (usually f2) from there you can select USB as your boot device, save and exit.

Good luck, everybody has to start somewhere. I suggest you read, a lot. :)
