Tails has no screen locker feature yet, but it's on the TODO list.
Tails has no timeout'n'logout feature, and it's not planned.
So, what the OP is experiencing looks like a bug, unless someone else restarted the system entirely or just the X session.

If they believe that's a bug, then please try to reproduce and [[report it|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]], thanks!

Thread closed.
