Hi Guys,

After downloading and installing tails onto usb #1 Using windows, I've tried to Clone & Install onto USB #2 so I'm able to configure a persistent volume.

Each & every time I click "Clone & Install" i get no response - the window disappears and nothing opens in its place.

"Clone & Upgrade" also has the same problem.

Upgrade from ISO does not have this issue, but That doesn't really help because it requires that tails is installed on the 2nd USB already....

Is anyone able to shine a light on this?
