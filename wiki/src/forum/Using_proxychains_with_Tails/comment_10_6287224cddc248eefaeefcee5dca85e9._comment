> Would a tails dev unoffically comment on this? 

I'm not sure what there is to comment about here. It seems like a few Tails users are discussing a technique that is not supported by Tails yet, but might be some day.

You may very well be the ones who are the most interested in this topic, so please go on and [[contribute]] the missing bits of documentation or patches :)
