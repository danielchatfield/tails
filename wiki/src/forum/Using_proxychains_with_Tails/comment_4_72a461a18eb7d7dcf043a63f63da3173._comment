I'm too trying to chain a tailing a SOCKS proxy (i.e. to circumvent TOR exit node blocks). In earlier TAILS version I was able to override the Torbutton proxy and tails still enforced the route to the proxy through the onion network.

Now - what ever I try to change in iceweasel (entering proxy in torbutton and/or browser) this no longer seems to work? 

Any hints on that?
