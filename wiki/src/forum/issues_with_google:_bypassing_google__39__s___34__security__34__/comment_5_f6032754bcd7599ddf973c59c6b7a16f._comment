How does that help me now or answer the above? I already tried to access my google account via providing all the details I could to try to regain access. Google states that this is a ip address issue. They capture the ip address in order to resolve the issue. I thought providing enough info on the acc could overule that. However, google sent me an email stating that they did not have enough information to give me access. I personally think that is bs. The only way I can think of regaining access is to use a proxy that is close to where I successfully logged in last time or the first time. But I would be doing a lot of guessing to where that would be. I do remember the last successful login was from somewhere in Europe.
