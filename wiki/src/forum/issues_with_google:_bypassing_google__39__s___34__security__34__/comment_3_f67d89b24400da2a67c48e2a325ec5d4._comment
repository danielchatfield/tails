Thanks, that is a good idea. However, I would have to use a public proxy and I don't know how secure those are. I have found some public/open proxies that have https and are annoymous. Otherwise I may just have to use a different service. The question of using a proxy brings me to ask would it be possible and more secure to use proxy to connect to tor and then another proxy to connect to web. proxy-tor-proxy-world wide web? 

Does anyone have any ideas on how I gain access to my google account at least one more time?
