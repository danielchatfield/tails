I was able to install the file \"tor_0.2.2.34-1~~squeeze+1_i386.deb\" offline and then connected to a netwrok. The security warning on top right still came out, so I ran the apt-get command mentioned in the page. It downloaded the repositories DB ~ 20 MB over like 10 min and then told me that Tor is uptodate.

Just wanted to prvide a feedback on the warning message.
