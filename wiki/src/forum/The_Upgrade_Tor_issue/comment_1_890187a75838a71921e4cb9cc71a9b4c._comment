I could post a link, but would you verify its integrity by checking it's signature? When using apt-get (as in our instructions) the downloaded package is integrity checked automatically. Hence I suggest that you follow our instructions just once to be sure that you get the correct package, and then you copy /var/cache/apt/archives/tor_*.deb to a USB drive.
