The file \"tor_0.2.2.34-1~~squeeze+1_i386.deb\" has permissions limited to root so I could not copy it either. The file is only 937 kb. The other downloads (total ~ 20 MB or more) are the issue. I think updating the apt-get database packages is the one taking all the bandwidth.

I am not sure if it is possible to update a single package without having to update the apt-get inventory. Is there?

Thnx
