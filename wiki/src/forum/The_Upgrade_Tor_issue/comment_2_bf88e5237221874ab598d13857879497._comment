I have Tails in CD and USB.
I can't copy mentioned file from archive into USB, \"paste\" is empty, maybe because archive folder is with locked files. I tried to copy to desktop and I got this: Error opening file: Permission denied.

when I insert tails USB I see folders isolinux and live, if we copy it to Live folder, how to use it when we start tails from usb?
