Updatng tor on a live cd generally takes about 12-20 minutes for a 950Kish size file; usually 400-700b's a sec for some reason. As above, I am also having difficulty copying the tor*.deb file belonging to root although I am root in cli when upgrading tor. I also wish to cut down on the update time and just dpkg -i it. Could someone guide us on how to obtain the file once dl'd from torproject. Thx
