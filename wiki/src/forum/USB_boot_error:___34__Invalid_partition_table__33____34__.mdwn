Hi,

I just created a Tails 0.12.1 boot DVD and booted it on a Dell notebook --> works

Then I created a USB boot device with Tails USB installer. The USB stick works fine on other computers, but on the very notebook it was created on, the only result it produces when being booted from is the error message "Invalid partition table!". I tried this whith various different USB sticks - same result. On the other hand, when the USB stick is set up with a Windows 7 installation image, it can be booted from on the given notebook without any issue.

Obviously, there's some issue with the combination Tails/USB boot/notebook hardware which I'm not able to resolve by myself.

Any ideas how to solve this?

Thanks...
