Make sure that before you boot into the desktop screen (either the Gnome GUI or Windows XP camouflage GUI), enter a password and re-enter to confirm it.

To change the MAC of your machine, open up a terminal window and type the following: sudo macchanger -a eth0

Enter the password when prompted.

N.B.: The last character in eth0 is the number zero and not the letter O as in Omega.
