TAILS as a home router.
I think Tails would be perfect for building al little low cost anon box. Just build a cheap PC with a CDROM, 2 network adapters and maybe 4Gigs memory. Then connect the first Network adapter to your WAN router. Then the 2nd to a cheap switch. And voila - this would be your anon box.
