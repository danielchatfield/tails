LUKS / cryptsetup, which is included in Tails?

However you won't gain much from nesting volumes unless:

 * You use different passwords, in which case only one volume with a longer password is easier/faster for the same security gain

 * You use different encryption algorithms to protect against any of them being broken in the future

 * You don't trust one of them e.g. TrueCrypt, in which case you should use only the other one

And GnuPG can encrypt individual files, but probably not what you want.
