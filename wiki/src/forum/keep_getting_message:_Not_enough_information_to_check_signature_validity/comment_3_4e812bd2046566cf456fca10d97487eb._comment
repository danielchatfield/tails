It's true that such questions are frequently asked, but I believe the purpose of this forum is to answer even questions we have seen before.

@ OP:

First: download three files from the Tails website:

* the iso image itself (over 800 MB)
* the detached signature (names ends in pgp)
* the Tails signing key

Second: import the key into your keyring.

Third: verify the detached signature of the iso image

The details are here

I guess you forgot to process the signing key.

You shouldn't use Tails unless you can verify the signature.

(And you shouldn't trust the signature unless you have good reason to think you have the genuine key, so it is a good idea to check that the key you have is the same as that available in public keyservers.)
