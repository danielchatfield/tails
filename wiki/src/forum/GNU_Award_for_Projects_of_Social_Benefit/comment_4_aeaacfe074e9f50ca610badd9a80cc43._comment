1.) URL in comment 2 for \"Adblock Plus Icon Missing!\" thread got munged. Apparently underscores get automatically converted to bold-text.

Let's see if this works: (indenting four spaces in order to format as \"code\")

2.) Although I stand by what I write in comment 2, I must also point-out that that I feel that \"comment 1\" went too far in belittiling the TAILS project. 

Whoever the TAILS are, and whatever their motives, I think you do have to give them credit for the product they have created in TAILS. I am not aware of anything else that provides the same functionality and is as usable for the masses. (Unfortunately, because of what I noted in my previous comment, I cannot rule-out malicious intent behind TAILS and insidious risk in using it.)
