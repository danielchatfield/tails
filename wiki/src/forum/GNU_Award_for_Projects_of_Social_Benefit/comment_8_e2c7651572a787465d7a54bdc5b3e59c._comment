I can't understand this. How do you plan to verify their explanations of their motivation? What are you expecting them to say?.. *I'm a Tails developer because I work for the CI... oops, ...because I really care about freedom of speech in Myanmar, where my grandparents came from.

This reminds me of US boarder officials having to ask all visitors \"Are you a communist? Have you come to the US to assassinate the president?...\"
