Regarding trust: well that is one of the beauties of free software is it not? SELINUX was invented by the NSA, that's as bad as possible \"malicious intent\" can go. But since the software itself is free and open source you can use it without fear since it got reviewed by many people.

Comment 10 by an anonymous tails dev also gives a very good argument on this topic. Regarding accountability and free (and open source) software.

@comment 8 -  wow you really like to stay on topic don't you.. Haters are gonna hate I suppose..though how they are always around to comment on while tails is not trustworthy despite being mostly free software (and even when not, verifiable), I cannot see unless they are well motivated (paid?) trolls (by whom I wonder?)

Still is Tails considering applying? I would like to encourage tails-devs to do so :) worse that can happen is not to win, possibly because the necessary scale has not yet been reached so...(unless it is necessary to reveal your true identity, in which case you would probably get exposed to the same amount of harassment as tor devs in which case it maigth not be worth it)
