> Or does tails have proprietary firmware code which prevents this?

Tails does ship with proprietary firmwares. Otherwise most users would not be able to use their Wi-Fi devices. In doubts, they can be removed in [[custom builds|contribute/build]] by removing the relevant Debian packages.

> Tails is just Debian live with some packages added, a few tweaks, and a few custom scripts thrown in.

That's probably what we thought Tails will be when the project started. Three years later, you can just see by yourself through a look to at least the [development mailing-list archives](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/), the history of the various [[Git repositories|contribute/git]], the [[user documentation|doc]] and the [[amount of tests|contribute/release_process/test]] that are manually done for each release.

Also, it does not seem you realize the amount of support that is required by a user oriented project like Tails. We have a pretty good commitment to answer every single request that we receive...

> Don't forget things like this: *AdBlock stuff*

If this is really bothering you, please send a patch. Then we will discuss about it. I'd also like to remind that the [[forum]] page explicitly state: *The forum is open for discussions about Tails that **do not** belong to bugs, feature requests and the like.*

> How do we even know how many people are involved?

Once again, looking at the [development mailing-list archives](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/) should give you an idea.

> Heck, they won't even disclose their motivations.

Do you really want to ask *every* contributors of free software projects their motivations? We have written a [[pretty long statement regarding trust|doc/about/trust]]...
