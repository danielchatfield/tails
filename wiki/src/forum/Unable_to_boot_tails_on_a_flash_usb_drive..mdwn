Hi everyone, I've been having a hell of a time trying to boot from a usb drive both the new 0.12 and the 0.11 versions.

i have burn cd iso of both 11 and 12 and those boot without a problem whatsover, but when i create the usb drives ( Applications ▸ Tails ▸ Tails USB installer and than Clone and Install ) and try to boot from those both versions fail. Btw i do get the interface when i get to choose between live or live (Failsafe) but it than freezes  and nothing happens.

I have use 3 differents usb drives and nothing works, any help will be appreciated.
