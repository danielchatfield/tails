&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booting rEFIt from a CD on a Mac and selecting a USB device that has Tails installed on it fails.  It actually resorted to booting Windows from a Bootcamp partition on this Mac--strange.  You noted that rEFIt must be installed, and perhaps that means it cannot just be run from a disc in order to boot Tails on an iMac.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create this bootable USB drive, I used a formula found here https://tails.boum.org/forum/How_do_I_do_what_unetbootin_does/#comment-fc6a0040a29918839343a50396ef4082
and it worked beautifully, except Tails 12.1 has disk utility instead of Gparted, which makes adding a boot flag harder--but that's a different story.
