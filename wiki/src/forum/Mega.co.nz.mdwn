Hi, I know we're not supposed to make feature requests in this forum, but I don't know where else to ask for implementation of Mega.co.nz

The current Iceweasel Web Browser is not supported by use of Mega.co.nz. For those of us who need the utmost in privacy of personal files, storing of those files in an encrypted cloud service such as Mega.co.nz is much safer than keeping a persistent volume with a copy of Tails.

It would be greatly beneficial to many users if some sort of capability to use Mega.co.nz along with Tails were implemented.

Thank you for considering.
