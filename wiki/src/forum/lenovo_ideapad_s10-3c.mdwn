Keybord doesn't work . I can type "bridge" while booting , but then just before word "debian" appear on the screen , i see 
Loading, please wait...
[    14.224137]: COMRESET failed (errno=-16)
[    24.224137]: COMRESET failed (errno=-16)
[    38.224137]: COMRESET failed (errno=-16)

and etc.
Each time I boot numbers are random .
And than keybord doesn't work. What is the reason? My netbook or something else? Can I fix it? Thank you .
