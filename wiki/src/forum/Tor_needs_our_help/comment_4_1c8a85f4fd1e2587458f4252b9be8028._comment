@ 1-3:

What makes you so sure the OP is a \"Tor staff\"?  This assumption seems odd, especially considering the fact that the OP asks about things which Tor staffers presumably know the answer to.

@ \"Tails\":

I think the commentator should let you moderate.

I would be astonished if you agreed with the comment 1, but just in case, it seems to me that all Tails users depend upon the Tor network functioning well.  The OP asks how Tails users can best use Tails to provide a obfsproxy3 bridge in order to help users in China.  This is surely on-topic in the Tails forum.
