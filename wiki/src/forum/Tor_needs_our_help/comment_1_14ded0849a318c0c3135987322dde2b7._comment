@ OP

This forum is for discussion about Tails, not Tor.

If, as you claimed, Tor needs our help, Tor staff should have *at the very least the courtesy* to set up a forum for discussion at their website.

For the past few years I have been writing to Tor urging its developers to set up a forum to **no** avail.

Since Tor staff could not be bothered with setting up their own forum, they should **not** hijack this Tails' forum to discuss their problems or requests for help.
