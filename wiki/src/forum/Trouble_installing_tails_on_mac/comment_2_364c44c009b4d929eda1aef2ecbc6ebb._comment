@ OP

Your difficulty has been asked many times in the past. Have you searched the forum before making this post?

To answer your question: many Mac users find it difficult to use Tails on their machines. And my simple answer has always been: if using Tails is critical for you, go get a cheap Wintel PC computer. That was what I did.
