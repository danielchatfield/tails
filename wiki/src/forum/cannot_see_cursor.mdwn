I cannot see the cursor when using the live cd or live usb on my dell 700m laptop.  I am able to see the position of the cursor by using that control under the mouse settings, but it is very frustrating.  I have tried changing the boot options, by pressing tab at boot, but cannot seem to change the boot options.  Thanks
