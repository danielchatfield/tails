Sometimes with all the constructive critisism, wants, and needs of a community you are trying to support, it may seem like a endless, ungrateful job. Since taking the torch from Incognito I want to sincerely thank the developers of Tails for providing such a superior product. Thank you for giving your best every day. We really appreciate you.
