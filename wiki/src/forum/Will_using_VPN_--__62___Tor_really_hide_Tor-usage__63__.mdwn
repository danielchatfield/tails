I have read somewhere that it has no effect to use VPN (OpenVPN) for hiding your Tor-usage. I can not find anymore where I have read that, but could that be true? As for I can remember the writer of the article said that Tor uses a special data flow and your ISP can see that flow even if you use encrypted VPN in front of Tor.

Can someone verify this please?
