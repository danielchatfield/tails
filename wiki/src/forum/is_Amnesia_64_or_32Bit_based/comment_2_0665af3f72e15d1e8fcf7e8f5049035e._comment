Thank's Anonymous for the feedback.

The reason that I asked that question was, because I am contemplating to add(remaster) some kind of
virtualisation/hypervisor to Amnesia and I heard from VMware people that this is only under 64bit 
Linux Livesystems reasonable. (but probably VMware is to buggy/unsecure to use it in such an sensitive 
environment :-(

By running some sentitive apps in a VM, - among others - I hope to be able to prevent IP leaking to 
some extent.

John
