> (1) Microsoft Windows users find it easier to just compute and compare SHA-1 hashes than downloading and installing Gpg4win, configuring Kleopatra, importing the signature file, etc...

This is quite obviously a sweeping generalization based on your own preferences. In my experience most Windows users have no clue what a cryptographic hash function like SHA-1 is and that it can be used for authenticity checking (they don't even know what 
*that* is, and why it is a very good idea). Instead they just download stuff without verifying the authenticity at all. *That* is what Windows users prefer. The same goes, in my experience, with most Linux users, so we're not treating either camp different really.

Yes, learning a new tool is painful, but it is our conviction that using gpg's signature verification is vastly superior to manual hash sum comparisions.

> (2) Most Microsoft Windows users are not conversant with Linux, Debian, FreeBSD, etc and their commands. In fact I have no knowledge of Linux when I started using Tails.

I don't see how this point is relevant as signature verification doesn't depend on Linux/*BSD or the command-line interface. We provide steps for Microsoft Windows how to verify our images using GUI tools only. If anything we're more discriminating to Linux users using other desktop environments than GNOME, e.g. KDE users. And Mac OS X users. :)

> Question to Tails developers: Do you welcome Microsoft Windows users to use your software, even those who have no knowledge of Linux?

Everyone is equally welcome. :)
