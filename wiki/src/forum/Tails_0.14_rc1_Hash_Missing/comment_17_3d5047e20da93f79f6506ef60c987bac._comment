@15

Probably due to the confusion it causes... many people here just can't seem to \"get it\"... just look around this forum! ...and Tails is targeted at those with specific interest in privacy/security. Imagine the chaos this'd cause for a mainstream distro... The support burden could be horrendous while the necessity is virtually absent. Hence only \"serious\" distros even bother at all ;o)

@16 What bad language? \"Microsoft\"?
