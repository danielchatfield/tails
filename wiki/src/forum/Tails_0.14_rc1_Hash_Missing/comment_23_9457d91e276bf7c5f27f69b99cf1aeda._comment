Why? 

If an attacker could penetrate the *server* where the ISO resides, couldn't they just replace it with a trojan ISO? 

I don't mean to imply that penetrating such a server is *easy* but I wonder just *how difficult* it actually is for the kind of \"big guys\" I refer-to below.

Never mind them, what about the big guys, i.e., sophisticated organized crime operatives and governments? 
(not to imply that the two aren't often largely synonomous...)
