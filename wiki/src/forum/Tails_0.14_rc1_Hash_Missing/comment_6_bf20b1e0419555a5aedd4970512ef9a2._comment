>Use the signature file for verification/validation

Below are my reasons for preferring SHA-1 to the signature file for verification/validation:

(1) Microsoft Windows users find it easier to just compute and compare SHA-1 hashes than downloading and installing Gpg4win, configuring Kleopatra, importing the signature file, etc...

(2) Most Microsoft Windows users are not conversant with Linux, Debian, FreeBSD, etc and their commands. In fact I have no knowledge of Linux when I started using Tails.

Question to Tails developers: Do you welcome Microsoft Windows users to use your software, even those who have no knowledge of Linux?
