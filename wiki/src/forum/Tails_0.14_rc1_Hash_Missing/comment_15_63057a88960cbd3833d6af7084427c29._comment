Why do so few GNU/Linux distros provide digital signatures?

Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora are the only ones I've seen that do-- out of hundreds that I've looked at.

And in the case of Ubuntu, it's like they all but hide the signatures now; last I checked there wasn't even any mention of verifying the ISO on the main Ubuntu download page.
