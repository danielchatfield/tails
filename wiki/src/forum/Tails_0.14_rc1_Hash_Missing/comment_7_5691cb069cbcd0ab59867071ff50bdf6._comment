With only using a cryptographic hash (like SHA-1), you can only assert that you have downloaded the file correctly. That's all.

When verifying cryptographic signature, you can assert that you have (correctly) downloaded the file **and** that it was made available by a trusted source. Anyone can provide an ISO and a cryptographic hash. But only those with access to the Tails signing key can provide an ISO and a cryptographic signature.

Also look on various methods to [[trust Tails signing key|doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key]] in the documentation.
