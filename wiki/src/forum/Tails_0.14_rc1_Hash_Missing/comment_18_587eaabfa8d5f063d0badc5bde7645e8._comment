I wonder how thoroughly you examined those \"hundreds\" of others you looked at though. A policy of sequestering this stuff away somewhere very very discreet... Somewhere where those who know they need it (and already understand how to use it) will be able to find it but no-one else will ever know it even exists - seems to make a lot of sense! Certainly for anything *not* \"security orientated\" which doesn't need to flaunt its credentials.
