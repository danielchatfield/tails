In comments 7 and 8 **TAILS** cited the weaknesses and limitations of relying on checksums/hashes for verification/authentication. From the context, it would appear that this was offered as a response to the request of the OP and others that a checksum/hash be provided for the latest release candidate of TAILS.

Yet, the TAILS web site *does* provide a sha256sum for each *final* release of TAILS. 

I suppose the rationale is that anyone knowledgable/adept/savvy enough to be testing a *pre-release* version of TAILS, would surely be knowledgable/adept/savvy enough to be comfortable using GPG to verify an ISO *and* recognize the importance of doing so?
