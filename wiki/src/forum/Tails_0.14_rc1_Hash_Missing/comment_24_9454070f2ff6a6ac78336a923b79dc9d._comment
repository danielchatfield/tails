Hmmm... not an option against Tails (obviously), or any of the other serious distros (such as those named earlier) which offer cryptographic authentication (the fraud would quickly be spotted by the users - I can even remember a couple of recent *scares* of exactly this). The \"serious distros\" probably also employ some pretty hefty intrusion detection. Probably a perfectly viable attack against at least some of the smaller \"hobbyist\" distros. The sort of project where a \"release\" involves the sole developer dumping an ISO and a couple of checksums onto some leased virtual server by ftp/ssh/whatever.

>I don't mean to imply that penetrating such a server is easy but I wonder just how difficult it actually is for the kind of \"big guys\" I refer-to below.

*Could* be very straightforward. Even for the script kiddies. There must be one or two sloppy \"networking isn't my thing\" lone \"developers\" out there among the plethora.

>>your average link pwning script kiddy

>Never mind them, what about the big guys, i.e., sophisticated organized crime operatives and governments? (not to imply that the two aren't often largely synonomous...)

I suppose that, as the whole of \"desktop Linux\" is such a small pond anyway, it just isn't worth messing with any of the smaller malnourished mosquito larvae? Perhaps the attacker could create themselves a little botnet or something out of the few hundred?/thousand? users around the world such a distro might have but the users would probably be astute enough for it to be very short-lived. Just not worth the bother?

Please forgive the abominable grammar today. too much/little coffee/sleep ;o)
