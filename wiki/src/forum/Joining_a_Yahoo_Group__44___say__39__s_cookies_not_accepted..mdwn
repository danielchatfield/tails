I tried to find a previous thread, but was unsuccessful so I would like to ask:

I want to join a Yahoo Group as several different users from my computer and not have the moderators or users find out the posts are coming from the same person or computer.  I thought I could use TOR to be anonymous and hide my IP address, but Yahoo Groups won't let me sign into the group.  It says that I won't accept its cookies.  

I'm not a computer engineer so can anyone out there help me?  I can use TOR or Tails.  Is it possible to sign into the same Yahoo Group as several users and not be traced back to my computer?

Thanks so much for your time.

I have "accept first-party cookies" enabled and tried "accept third-party cookies" enabled and disabled.  None of them worked.
