@ OP:

I think what respondents are trying to say boils down to this:

* it would be desirable for Tails users to employ all possible methods for guarding against all possible attacks (among those which really can affect Linux kernels and Debian-like software distributions; note that the most likely attacks are likely to exploit vulnerabilities in software other than the kernel which is needed to make Tails usable, like the browser)

* it would be desirable for Tails users to have tools which can audit the behavior of their Tails system (presumably booted from a live USB stick) to confirm that it (together with routers and other peripherals) does not appear to be leaking de-anonymizing data (which could perhaps happen due to programming errors, or maybe due to user error, not just due to malware, and which could have disastrous consequences)

* (some say) given the anticipated rapid growth this year in \"police malware\" targeting all Tor users globally, it would be desirable for Tails users to have tools which can resist/detect infection by such malware

However:

* it turns out these desiderata are rather tangential to \"antivirus\" as known in the Windows world

* they would be difficult to achieve even for such capable entities as modern nation states

Consequently, you should expect Tails developers to largely ignore these issues (except just possibly the first) and hope for the best.
