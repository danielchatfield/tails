>Cant an anti virus be shipped with Tails?

**NO**

There is **no** place for snake-oil in a serious privacy/security distribution. If you need to patch-up a toy OS, you need another tool. Systemrescue CD, Pmagic, etc. This topic has been discussed *ad nauseam* already. Please use the search tool and/or read [the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)
