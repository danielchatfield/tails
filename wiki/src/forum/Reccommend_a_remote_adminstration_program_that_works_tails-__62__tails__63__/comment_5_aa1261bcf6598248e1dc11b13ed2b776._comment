Yep, let's ignore comments 1 & 3.

On a more serious note, I wish to tell the OP that there is no way for a Tails user to remotely control another Tails' user machine(s) or his own machine.

Have the OP examined the source code of Tails?

And if the OP wishes to install his own remote administration program, he will have to contend with the possibility of breaking the anonymity offered by Tails. Technical support is not offered to those who add/remove Tails' default software bundle.
