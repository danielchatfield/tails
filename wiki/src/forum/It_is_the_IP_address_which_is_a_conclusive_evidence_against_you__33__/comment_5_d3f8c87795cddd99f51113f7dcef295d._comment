You have summed up the whole scenario in a plain non-technical jargon which is very useful to the users like me. Such question had also struck my mind some time ago but I did not care to ask for technical detail. Anyways, I suggest the TAILS to include such important questions into a new category (Users Q&A) so that all users don't ask the same questions again and again. You can incorporate questions and answers of the users from this forum for a detailed introduction of TOR for advanced users.
