\"His freedom also matters to us because in case he is prosecuted, we too will have to face the music because police extorts confessions by third degree tortures.\"

I feel sorry for the people who live under such conditions. Its a reminder how these conversations can have serious consequences for some people. Perhaps I can suggest adding a layer of pysical security on top of existing anonynimity provided by tor/encription ect. perhaps use this concept https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving to ensure that even if your blog/facebook ect is traced back to an ip address that it can never take that extra step back to you

good luck surviving in your country and never never give up or they will be rewarded for their violence. Vary rarely in history is freedom given freely, it has to be demanded
