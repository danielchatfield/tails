>There is no point even if Tails wipes the data from the RAM because if you are traced through the IP addresses, then you are gone because it is your IP address which is a conclusive piece of evidence that you were using TAILS.

If you allow for plausible deniability in your actions and you live in a country that maintains high standards of proof, then your IP address will not be sufficient evidence.
Review the standards of proof of your local judicial system.

>Okay, now assume that you expose some kind of corruption and your adversaries knows you. He, if influential like Govt., can simple get one report filed with the Security agency/Police to trace the origin, and after getting suboena from the courts, all countries will start offering the logs available with them. Afterall, every IP we use is logged somewhere.

Not all countries cooperate with one another. For example: extradition treaties.

>According to this policy, every internet subscriber will be issued a username and password by the ISP which one will have to log onto the software (to be given by the ISP) if he wants to use internet.

How is this any different than the system ISPs use today? I have not yet encountered an ISP that allows anonymous access to its network. The ISP usually has mechanisms in place to control access to its network because they want to ensure that only subscribers to their service are connecting. Also, the ISP will typically log what user was using which IP address during some time interval to cover their own asses from litigation.
