@ OP:

> There is no point even if Tails wipes the data from the RAM because if you are traced through the IP addresses, then you are gone because it is your IP address which is a conclusive piece of evidence that you were using TAILS.

This is not why Tails clears the RAM. One use case of Tails is to work on sensitive documents, and if the RAM isn't cleared, remnants of it may remain in the RAM for some unspecified time. Also, if you attracts some unwanted attention *locally* (i.e. because they see that you use Tor; not because they broke Tor and traced you) doing an emergency shutdown will clear your RAM of your sassion history, which is a good thing. 

> Please note that Tails has no mechanism to set different nodes from 3 different countries, and sometimes the chain is US>>US>>UK. So you see that the first two nodes are in USA in this example and thus your anonymity is of no use.

It is only necessary to correlate the packets you send to your Tor entry with the packets your exit sends to your destination, i.e. end-to-end correlation. For instance, in the worst case (when you and your desination server are in the same jurisdiction) doing that is completely independent of which Tor nodes you picked. In your example the `US>>US>>...` part of the circuit isn't particularly troubling since the middle node is irrelevant for end-to-end correlation; it's only relevant for \"evil\" nodes that share information with each other, which is a much more stupid/risky/inefficient endevour for an attacker that can log all traffic in its jurisdiction instead.

What Tor perhaps could try to do is to make sure that the following pairs are not in the same (or collaborative) jurisdictions (or IXs/autonomous systems): (you, exit), (entry, exit), (entry, destination). I believe it's an open research problem to estimate the anonymity loss of limiting Tor's node selection like this versus to do what Tor currently does. It's not as clear cut as you seem to think.

Also, I believe you are underestimating the challange involved in trying to correlate Tor traffic on a large, dragnet style scale. The amount of data that has to be logged is **MASSIVE**; you need exact timings of each (or at least many) packet of each stream, not just when a stream was initiated. Coordinating the distribution of this data from all eavesdropping points is another huge problem. But even with all that information at hand (i.e. like an imagined global adversary) [correlation may still be hard and incoclusive](http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html). It's not as easy as you seem to think.

> Don't you think that criminals are also aware of existence of Tails, and I am sure that they are got caught after despite using TAILS or Tor or any other anonymous system.

We know that \"criminals\" (as labelled by `$GOVERNMENT`) use Tor, and we know that some of them get caught any way because of mistakes ([example](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/07/lulzsec_takedown_analysis/); admittedly that mistake would have been prevented if he used Tails) and old fashioned police investigation techniques such as infiltration ([example](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/04/online-drug-market-takedown/)). I've never seen any conclusive evidence to the contrary, that someone was caught due to Tor being *truly* broken. Until such evidence is presented, your claims are just baseless speculation.

Tor just handles the anonymous transport of IP traffic, which often isn't everything a crime is about. There are innumerable other ways to catch a Tor using criminal (especially when money is involved, which it quite often is) even if Tor was magically unbeatable in every scenario (which it doesn't claim to be: see section 3.1 about Tor's threat model in [the design paper](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.pdf)). Even in reality, where Tor is imperfect, there's most likely always a way to catch a criminal that is cheaper than breaking Tor. If there isn't, is the crime worth the investment for breaking Tor? Indeed, it's all about economics.

@ If there is no MITM attack, then?:

> ONE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION: Does our traffic passes through the computers of the node holders (people acting as nodes 1 to 3), or does it pass directly through the ISP like common socks proxies. The help documentation of Tails are mostly vauge because the language doesn't enable anyone to form firm opinion.

To be able to \"form a firm opinion\" (which also is correct) you have to know at least some basics of our current Internet infrastructure. I'm unsure if it's reasonable for us to have to lecture our users about this. To answer your question: yes, Tor traffic (in Tails and elsewhere) passes through your ISP just like *all* of your Internet traffic *must*. Perhaps [this diagram](https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https) may be of help.
