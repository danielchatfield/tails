I notice that the versions of Tor and Vidalia provided by Tails Live CD are always a bit behind those provided by the Tor Project.

As an example, the latest Tor Browser Bundle is version 2.2.37-2 with the following:

Update Firefox to 10.0.6esr
Update Vidalia to 0.2.20
Update NoScript to 2.4.8
Disable Firefox crashreporter

My questions are:

(1) Is it safe to download and install the above Tor Browser Bundle (TBB)? By "safe", I mean that the TBB will not break Tail's anonymity.

(2) If the answer to (1) is yes, where can I download it to? To the "persistent volume" created by me using the Tails' USB stick?
