I am aware of the security risks.

I'm on 0.12. StrictExitNodes doesn't seem to work anymore. I'm not even sure ExitNodes works. None of my configuration changes seem to be working.

AllowDotExit doesn't seem to work either. 

I'm doing "sudo service tor reload" after editing /etc/tor/torrc but nothing seems to take effect.
