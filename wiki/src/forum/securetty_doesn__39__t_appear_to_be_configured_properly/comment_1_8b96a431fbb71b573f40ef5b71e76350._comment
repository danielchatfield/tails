Tails' root password is disabled, so **logging in** (i.e. via `login`, which btw isn't started by default in any TTY) as root is impossible (one can  still use `sudo su` to become root if an [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]] was set, of course). AFAICT `securetty` is completely pointless in Tails.
