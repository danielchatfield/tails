When booting from the USB drive I receive the message "Operation System Not Found"  I created the USB image from a working DVD image. I tried cloning the image two times with the same result. I have tried the USB thumb drive in both a USB 2.0 and 3.0 slot. I can boot other versions of linux from the thumb drive just fine. Any ideas?
