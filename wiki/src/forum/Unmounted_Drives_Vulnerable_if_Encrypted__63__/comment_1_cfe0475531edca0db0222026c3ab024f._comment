Regarding the text,
\"wouldn't any encrypted volume be just as safe from remote access/attack as it would be from local*, i.e., physical access/attack?\"
in my OP,

1.)  I meant to write, 

Wouldn't any encrypted volume be *at least* as safe from *remote* attack/access than it (encrypted volume) would be from *physical* access?

2.) The words that got italicized were not the ones I intended to italicize. It seems the culprit is the asterisk I placed next to the first instance of the word 'safe' in order to point-to the parenthetical note I placed just below.
