Re Comment 6:

>  If you're not running any services that are exposed to the fucking internet(remember there's iptables and your router in between you and them), and they can't physically plant a trojan on your system somehow (ie within your tails cd/usb/iso or in a virus or an installed package)

Just wanted to point out that the Tails threat model *should* incorporate the expectation that adversaries (often repressive governments which have bought a cyberintrusion-as-a-service package from amoral cyberwar/cyberspy companies like Gamma International) are trying to plant sophisticated malware, usually by means incorporating these features:

* forcing or tricking a genuine certificate authority into issuing the attacker a legitimate but improperly issued certificate which allows the attacker to \"game the system\" to masquerade as mozilla.org 
* disguising malware as a legitimate upgrade (perhaps to an add-on such as Noscript)

Please note that this is *not* a merely theoretical possibility as this has been documented in numerous recent attacks on human rights activists and political dissidents worldwide.

*State-sponsored malware may be the most important threat faced by many regular users of Tails*
