On the other hand, I suppose an attacker could do something like write data that would be incriminating to a user to a volume and then delete it only *logically/insecurely*. (Such an attacker would either:
a) already have reason to expect the volume in question to come into the hands of an entity who would find the hidden data and use it against the attacker's target,
or,
b) do something to facilitate his target receiving such attention )

Since most people do not routinely examine what has been logically deleted, the presence of the incriminating files would go unnoticed in most cases.
