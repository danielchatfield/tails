@5: I realize, of course, that anyone with *physical* access to any media could easily do whatever they wish to it. But even then, I still wonder how it would it be possible to do either of the following without leaving traces that would be obvious:
a) even just *format* media that had until then been raw , or,
b) write *any* data to a volume that was formatted but completely empty

In either case, wouldn't a regular user be able to see what was done? 

Wouldn't Palimpsest, GParted, fdisk or any comparable utility show that a drive or volume had been formatted?

And wouldn't any writing of data to a formatted volume that had been completely empty be visible in any file manager (At least by showing hidden files)?
