>What about empty drives or partitions?

>Is it possible for a remote attacker to install something harmful on an empty drive or partition that would not be detectable-- at least not easily so?

*Local* attacker = trivial. *Remote* = remotely rooting your Tails session. i.e. Not so easy.

>And, even if this would be possible with formatted media, would it also be possible with unformatted as well?

No different. E.g. GPT/21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649 (ef02 for short) is raw (\"unformatted\") data. You'd still have to locate, load and execute your code - by way of perverting the system BIOS or bootloader or whatever - of course. Could be useful if your payload was too large for a more conventional home (MBR or whatever) esp. as modern MS boxen leave a few MB of space on each medium unallocated just in-case you should ever want to go all LVMtastic. 

>@3: I recall posts, possibly even one from Tails, saying that it is indeed possible for a remote attacker to extract passphrases/keys from RAM.

Of course. Having achieved adequate system access/privileges.

>How difficult such an attack would be to pull-off, I don't know.

Not sure if you're still talking about running code from raw media or reading encryption keys from RAM now... but both should be (and are) easy with root/physical access and difficult without.
