What about *empty* drives or partitions? 

Is it possible for a remote attacker to install something harmful on an empty drive or partition *that would not be detectable*-- at least not easily so?

And, even if this would be possible with *formatted* media, would it also be possible with *unformatted* as well?

@3: I recall posts, possibly even one from Tails, saying that it is indeed possible for a remote attacker to extract passphrases/keys from RAM. 

How difficult such an attack would be to pull-off, I don't know.
