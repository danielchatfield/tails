A lot of *IFs* there...

>If someone can connect to a service on your system and get a root shell, 

As I understand it, at any given moment there are any number of vulnerabilities present that could, potentially, be exploited by an attacker. 

This is true even for a system where updates are installed as soon as they become available (as it takes some time for vulns to be discovered and for effective patches to be developed and released). Certainly true for Tails, where updating between ISO releases is emphatically not supported.

>then this is all paranoid and purely academic.

That may very well be true if you're, say, just a kid in a bourgeois household using Tails to bypass blocks and access naughty content without leaving traces.

(And I would suspect this accounts for a fairly considerable number of Tails users. A product like Tails is no doubt a dream come true for many kids...)

Or if you're using Tails to maintain your privacy while researching say, a medical condition.

Etc., etc., you get the idea.

Such users probably don't have much to worry about.

But for someone who either:
a) is *already* a target of one or more powerful, determined adversaries
or,
b) is likely to *become* such a target 
(whether through his use of Tails or for other reasons)

Then, it's another story, isn't it? 

>(remember there's iptables and your router in between you and them)

As far as the \"your router\" part, this assumes that someone is using Tails behind a router that they either *know* or can reasonably *assume* is using **NAT** and/or running a **properly configured firewall**.

That isn't the case when using, for example, public WiFi, is it?
