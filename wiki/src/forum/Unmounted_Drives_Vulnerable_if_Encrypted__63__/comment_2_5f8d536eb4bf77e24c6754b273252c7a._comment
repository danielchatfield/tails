> Granted, bootable encrypted media (i.e., full-disk encryption OS installs) would presumable still pose a concern because of the necessarily unencrypted /boot partition.

Definitely. A few possible protections are:

* `/boot` on a separate USB stick (which also is a great place to store an encryption key so you don't rely solely on a passphrase, which usually is weaker).
* Use [TrustedGRUB](https://projects.sirrix.com/trac/trustedgrub/).

> How much of a realistic risk, then, is remote tampering with the /boot partition? How difficult is it to pull-off?

Questions like these are always hard to answer, so I'll just say this: In order to be able to do modify `/boot` the attacker would have to be able to execute arbitrary code as root. By not setting a sudo password in Tails greeter you should be better protected since the attacker would need a privilege escalation exploit for that to happen.

Yes, as long as the encrypted container isn't open. And as long as you don't type the encryption passphrase during the Tails session (i.e. don't re-use the encryption passphrase for anything else).
