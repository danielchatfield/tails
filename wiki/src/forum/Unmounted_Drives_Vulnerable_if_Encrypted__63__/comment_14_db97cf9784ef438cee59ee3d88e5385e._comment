On that topic, what do you think about the suggestion that Twofish with 256 bit key may offer some advantages over Rijndael with 256 bit key (AES-256)?

* Rijndael has an algebraic structure which suggests a possibly fruitful line of reseach into novel attacks based on algebraic geometry; Twofish has a conventional Feistel cipher structure (with S-boxes incorporating key material so unpredictable in advance by the attacker)
* Twofish is intrinsically more resistant to cold boot attack than Rijndael even if attacker manages to prevent Tails user from properly shutting down Tails using the panic button (e.g. in the scenario in which secret police burst in upon a political dissident and capture a computer running Tails before the victim has a chance to react)
* Twofish is slightly faster than Rijndael for 256 bit keys

Just to be clear: I agree that from what is known about real-world attacks on almost-whole-disk encryption, it is far more important to ensure that key material is carefully wiped from RAM, assuming a Tails user is able to properly shut down Tails.
