> Assuming I am booting from a DVD and using an encrypted USB stick for crude persistence, is it practical to use apt-get to obtain verified debs and put them on the USB stick, and then instruct synaptic on Tails to install from the USB stick?

Once the persistence on DVD + USB feature is implemented, yes, that would be possible.
