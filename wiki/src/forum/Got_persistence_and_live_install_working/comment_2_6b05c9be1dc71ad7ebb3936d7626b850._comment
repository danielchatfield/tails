In the todo item, you mean something like the Knoppix option to make a small persistent directory on a hard drive?  Presumably well hidden using sophisticated steganography?  That might work for some users, but for others I think keeping all traces of Tor use of of anything which is hard to hide or replace (like a laptop or PC hard drive) is important.

I'd like to see a discussion (with a summary eventually in the Tails documentation pages) of the pros and cons for Tails users of booting from a (read-only) DVD versus USB stick.  I suspect that many Tails users may be thinking primarily about the persistence issues which arise when booting Tails from a DVD. But there may be security advantages to separating the bare minimum needed to operate Tails from software more related to activities which usually imply that some kind of persistence is in operation (for example, mounted encrypted USB stick).  

I even wonder whether there might not be usability/security advantages in providing two iso images containing software for different roles: 

* a bootable live CD providing Tor and the modified browser and software which interacts with the internet and probably extra encryption software offering encfs plus twofish and serpent

* a DVD containing all the software which can (should?) be put on a USB stick which is only mounted when we need it (for example, documention production) and stuff which is too large to fit on the live CD, possibly including things related to anti-stylometry tools which may require detailed natural language related information

Especially if those with more than 1 GB of RAM could read the live CD into RAM, freeing up their drive to then put the contents of the second iso on an encrypted volume in their USB stick using a Tails provided script.

Then, in operation one leaves (we hope) no permanent traces on the laptop or PC (or eventually, the smart phone or other harder to replace device), but has only a live CD for Tails itself and an encrypted USB stick which are both easier to toss in an emergency, to be replaced later.  The hope is that loading Tails from the live CD might make it harder for adversaries to mess with the binaries we load into RAM and use to operate Tails, while keeping any personal and production items (which we desire even more strongly not to give up to our adversaries) on a well encrypted and possibly steganographically partition on a separate device which is only mounted when we need it and can be more easily hidden or tossed in an emergency could offer advantages.

Some tools written for journalists and human rights workers traveling in dangerous areas include a panic button which erases data needed to decrypt the sensitive data, assuming full-on cryptanalysis of several GB of AES/serpent/twofish encrypted data is still too hard for our adversaries, as the Ramzi Youssef anecdote suggests.  You said that encfs has some flaws but it would be trivial to write a panic button for an encfs encrypted directory which would render the passphrase useless,  reducing the risk of successful \"rubber-hose cryptanalysis\" (although not of torture since as some astute journalists have recently pointed out, the real purpose of torture is almost always sheer revenge/sadism, not extraction of information).

A secret policeman is a secret policeman.  It is in the end impossible to say that some are \"good\" and others are \"bad\".  I am glad to see that from one of his recent reports, Roger Dingledine appreciates this key point.  So do malware-protection companies which are seeking to protect their customers against \"Western\"-state-sponsored malware.
