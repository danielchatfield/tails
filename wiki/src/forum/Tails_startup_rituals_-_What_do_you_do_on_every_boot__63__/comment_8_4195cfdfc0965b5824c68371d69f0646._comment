BTW, another thing many user's may not be aware of is the AdBlock Plus add-on. It is activated by default but rather hidden, as for some reason the Tails devs felt it worth their (already-strained) time and resources to change the *default* setting of ABP in order to not only hide the icon (through which essential info is conveyed) but to make it impossible to get it back.

So user beware: If you find certain expected functionality or content to be missing or impaired on a site or page somewhere, the culprit may be ABP.
