I get the following after running rake:

    You have uncommited changes in the Git repository. Due to limitations of the build system, you need to commit them before building Tails.

    If you don't care about those changes and want to build Tails nonetheless, please add `ignorechanges` to the TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable.

    Uncommited changes. Aborting.

I did a read-only checkout, so I do not understand why I am getting uncommitted changes. I tried to commit them, which seemed to work, but no difference.

I have not familiarized myself with the system to know how to set environment variables.

Thanks
