> Virtualbox, rake and vagrant all installed fine, but when I do \"git clone...\" it complains that three file names are too long. One starting \"All_DNS_Traffic...\" and two starting \"Is_it_possible...\".

Is this a fatal error? I mean, does the Git clone command exit with code non-zero?

> Rake of course blows out on a bunch of errors.

Please report these errors, I'm not sure the issue above is the cause of those ones.
