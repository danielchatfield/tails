Ok, figured out the environment variables. The files with the file names that are too long make git think there are changes. Entering:

    export TAILS_BUILD_OPTIONS=\"ignorechanges\"

Gets past that and rake now runs up to the point of launching the vm. At that point it gives the error that it cannot connect to the vm. I turned on trace, but that does not give any more information about the cause of the error.

In opening the vm in the virtual box gui and checking settings it shows operating system and version as debian 64 bit, although I am on a 32 bit machine. In setting it to 32 bit and trying to run from the gui, I get:

    VT-x features locked or unavailable in MSR.

Any ideas?

Thanks
