>If, as I suspect, I had merely run out of RAM, wouldn't TAILS simply freeze? How could it just automatically, spontaenously reboot like that-- especially when there was no boot-medium present?!

Are you confusing a full reboot with restarting your X session? 

>Let me note the following: - the computer this happened with has 2 GB of RAM

That's not much to play with - the ISO alone will eat almost half of it!

>*This was my first time using the toram option at boot

\"toram\" is \"not supported\" by the developers :o(

>*I rebooted from scratch immediately afterward, again using the toram option, without incident.

>Might what I exprienced have been the result of a remote intrusion?

*Might* I suppose. It *might* have been a martian hiding in your system case and prodding things too. ;o)

Sounds to me like something killed your X session... Some ideas of what that \"something\" might have been, in what I'd consider to be roughly descending order of probability:

* User error ;o)

* Linux - intentionally - after running out of memory

* Duff drivers (esp. video)

* Overheating CPU

* Loose electrical connection

* Faulty RAM

* Other assorted hardware faults

* Other assorted software faults

* Power surge

* EM interference

* Cosmic ray (yes, can happen!)

* Bored martians

* Angry mermaids

* Other assorted mythological beasties

* Intrusion
