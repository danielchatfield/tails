This thread seems like a case-in-point supporting the argument made in the the thread, [[Bug Reporting]]

As a direct result of posting to the *forum* and *not* filing an *official bug report*:
 
- OP's question was promptly solved by one or more helpful anons

- The Tails devs were spared time and trouble

- Others with the same or similar experiences could benefit from merely reading the thread
