>Are you confusing a full reboot with restarting your X session?

I suspect I was indeed doing just that, now that you ask.

>\"toram\" is \"not supported\" by the developers :o(

I hadn't realized that. 

I take it that \"not supported\" means that you're completely on your own should you decide to try it.

>It might have been a martian hiding in your system case and prodding things too. ;o)

A *nano*-Martian?

Did you really mean to place the possibility of intrusion below that of the four \"possibilities\" above-- even the three science fiction contingencies?

>User error ;o)

I suppose it's possible that I inadvertantly activated the keyboard shortcut for restarting X (though that seems unlikely, given that, If I recall correctly, it requires *three* separate keys to be pressed at once.

>Linux - intentionally - after running out of memory

I hadn't realized this was a possibility; as I had written, I had thought that running out of RAM would have resulted in a *freeze*.

>>the computer this happened with has 2 GB of RAM

>That's not much to play with - the ISO alone will eat almost half of it!

Yes but that still leaves 1 GB, which is the recommended minimum for running Tails.

Nonetheless, I probably was trying to do too much for what I had. 

Regarding the other possibilities you listed, most would seem highly unlikely to me-- based on what I know of the conditions at the time of the occurrence and my extensive history with the same hardware, etc. 

I haven't run `memtest` for a while, though, so perhaps I should now.

Thank you very much for the detailed reply.
