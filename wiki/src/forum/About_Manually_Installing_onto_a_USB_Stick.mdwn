For TAILS version 0.11:

In an Ubuntu 11.04 Live CD environment, syslinux was default, and the first command with isohybrid worked fine and using the diff command the copied ISO differed from the downloaded ISO.

However, the second command, cat [ISO] > /dev/sdX && sync did not work at all after checking and using the correct device name with System>Administration>Disk Utility.

What did work, as always, was the dd command:

    dd if=tails-0.11.iso of=/dev/sdX
