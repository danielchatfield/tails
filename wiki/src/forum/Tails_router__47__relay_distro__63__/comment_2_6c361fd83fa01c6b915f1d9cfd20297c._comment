[tor-ramdisk](http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdisk) is a \"Linux distribution whose sole purpose is to securely host a Tor server purely in RAM.\"

There's also (in development) [Torouter](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter), \"an easy to use system that is a bridge or relay by default, functions as your Internet router, and is around $120 or another hopefully reasonable price point.\"
