I don't think that the cooks spoiling the broth analogy works well for describing TOR use because in this case, the more \"cooks\" the better.

More seperate instances of TOR make the network more anonymous. The more individuals using it, the less of a niche it becomes - it is then more legitimized in the eyes of governments and the law and will be less subject to legal scrutiny further down the line.

I like the idea of a pre prepared TOR relay/exit OS that would run in RAM and from a CD though - I think that's a really good idea but you should maybe pitch that to the TOR devs. I think you might be able to buy boxes that basically come preconfigured for that function but I do like your idea.
