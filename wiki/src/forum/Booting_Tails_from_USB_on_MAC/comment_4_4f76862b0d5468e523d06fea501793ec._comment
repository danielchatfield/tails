Maybe this way. For that, you need Tails-LiveCD and Tails-LiveUSB:

1. Put the LiveCD into the optical drive, and plug the LiveUSB
2. Boot or reboot the MacIntel, holding the **OPTION** key. This will give you the ability to boot on the LiveCD.
3. One time you are in the LiveCD boot menu, select your language, and press the **TAB** key to edit options
4. Change 'live-media=removable' to ''live-media=removable-usb' and maybe more, depending on how your LiveUSB has been created.
5. Press **ENTER**
6. As soon as the kernel and the initramdisk have been loaded, eject the CD.

I think this should work, but have no Mac to test it. If someone tries, please, a feedback will be welcome..
