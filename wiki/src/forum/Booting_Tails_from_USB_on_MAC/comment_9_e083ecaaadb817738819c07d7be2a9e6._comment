>Booting Tails from CD to USB on MAC
Maybe this way. For that, you need Tails-LiveCD and Tails-LiveUSB:

Put the LiveCD into the optical drive, and plug the LiveUSB
Boot or reboot the MacIntel, holding the OPTION key. This will give you the ability to boot on the LiveCD.
One time you are in the LiveCD boot menu, select your language, and press the TAB key to edit options
Change 'live-media=removable' to ''live-media=removable-usb' and maybe more, depending on how your LiveUSB has been created.
Press ENTER
As soon as the kernel and the initramdisk have been loaded, eject the CD.
I think this should work, but have no Mac to test it. If someone tries, please, a feedback will be welcome..

Had tried many times with ReFit to no avail.
Thank you this got it to work.  It is a bit of a workaround but better than nothing. 

Cheers
