That is the official USB installer for Tails on Windows, it seems. But there is no way to verify it's integrity. No HTTPS, no GPG-signature as far as I can see.

Whether or not it was a MITM-attack here: Can the Tails developers host this installer on tails.boum.org, instead of sending users to a third-party site without MITM-protection.
