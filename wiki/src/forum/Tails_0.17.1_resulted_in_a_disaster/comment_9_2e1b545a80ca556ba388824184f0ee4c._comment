>That is the official USB installer for Tails on Windows,

Last I checked, *no* third-party program (whether Universal USB Installer, UNetbootin or anything else) was supported for installing Tails.

Thus, I am rather surprised that \"Tails\" made no mention of this.

Or is \"Universal USB Installer\" now supported by Tails?
