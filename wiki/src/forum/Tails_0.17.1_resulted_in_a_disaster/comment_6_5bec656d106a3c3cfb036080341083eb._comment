Here: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/ I have previously used the same installer with various (K/L/X)Ubuntu images without issues, but the only address verification i did while downloading the installer was the address bar link.

I'm unable to figure out whether the ethernet NIC is physically destroyed or if it's BIOS that lost track of it, because the NIC is built-in on the motherboard. It's unusable in both Windows 7 and Ubuntu, which i tested by booting from a live flash drive.

I have verified that the hard drive, memory and power supply are intact. Well, the power supply handled a 6 hour stress test fine, but who knows.

What i'd really, really like to know, is why did my HDD leds light up like the night star just a couple seconds after Tails was supposed to start from the flash drive?

It certainly was not due to BIOS detecting the drives, because that had already occurred prior to me choosing the flash drive as the boot device!
