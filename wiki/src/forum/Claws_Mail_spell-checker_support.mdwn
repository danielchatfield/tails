Claws Mail in Tails 0.17.2 doesn't seem to be able to access the spell-checker and/or dictionaries. In the Claws `Account preferences` on the `Compose` page, the `Spell check dictionaries` menu is well populated but selecting a dictionary from the menu and checking *Default dictionary* has no apparent affect. No spell checking during composition takes place. Composing in GEdit (for spell-checking) then copying into Claws is a bit clumbsy.
