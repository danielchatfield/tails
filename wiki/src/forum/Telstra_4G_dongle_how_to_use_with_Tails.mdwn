Hi Guys,

I use tails with no problems at home using my wireless connections but when travelling I'd like to use my Telstra 4G dongle. I connect it and then go through the wizard and choose Aust then telstra then 3G bit it never connects. I go in to edit but I'm not 100% if this will help at all. 

Any suggestions or has anyone had success using a Telstra dongle

Thanks
