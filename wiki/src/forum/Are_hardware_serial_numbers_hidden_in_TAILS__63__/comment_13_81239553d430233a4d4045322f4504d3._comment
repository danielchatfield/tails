Whonix is highly dubious to me. Its dificult as all hell to know if the host OS os compromised or not!!! I'm sorry , why run a virtual machine? Tor browser bundle burnt to cd makes way more sense.
Since you are already running in a possibly compromised host save yourself trouble. If you are serious about security, take the virtual machine concept out of the equation!
