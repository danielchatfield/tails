I've only read about whonix and not tried it, but the whole idea of two virtual machines seems both a bit 'belt and braces', and irrelevant.

It is fairly straight forward with iptables or the Tails distro to force all your traffic through tor; the problem is what data is your app communicating. If you are using a protocol like ftp on whonix then you are sending your IP to the target site and so the exit node can read your IP.

The problem is not enforcing tor, but using a select bunch of apps and protocols which don't leak private information over tor and whonix doesn't seem to deal with that problem.
