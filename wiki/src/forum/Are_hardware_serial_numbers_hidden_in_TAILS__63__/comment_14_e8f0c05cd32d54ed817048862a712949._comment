Indeed, that is why it's recommend to run Whonix on a dedicated host operating system. In the Readme and on the security page.

https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#host-security
https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Readme/

>> I'm sorry , why run a virtual machine? 

See advantages of Whonix:
https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#advantages-of-whonix

And if you honor the documentation, it can be even safer:
https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#security

It has some features, which I missed in Tails. Features I am personally interested in (but I was unable to submit patches for Tails):

Bridges Support (obfuscated) | VPN/Tunnel Support (any combination) | Hidden Service Support (any service) | Windows Support (Whonix-Gateway can torify Windows) | Flash Support (Flash though Tor without IP/DNS leaks)

Last but not least you don't have have to use Virtual Machines, you can also use two physical machines:

Just discover, give it a chance, it's not silly.
