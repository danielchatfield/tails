I was notified by a user about this discussion. While I cross read the Tails forums occasionally, I can't read each and any thread. 

> It says it hides serial numbers (but again, then it doesn't describe when they are supposed to leak, we can't solve something without knowing what the problem is)

The whole chapter:
https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#whonixs-protocol-leak-protection-and-fingerprinting-protection

The sub chapter about hardware serials:
https://sourceforge.net/p/whonix/wiki/Security/#less-important-identifies

\"These identifies are less important, because an adversary can only collect them, either if the user installed malicious software (for example, some copyright enforcement and anticheat tools collect them) or only if the the adversary local access, i.e. the adversary has compromised a user or in some cases the root account.\"

> If you are using a protocol like ftp on whonix then you are sending your IP to the target site and so the exit node can read your IP.

No, that is incorrect. The Whonix-Workstation is unaware of it's own external non-Tor IP address and can only transmit traffic through Tor. Thus, the target website can only get the IP of the exit node. That was one of the main reasons, why I started Whonix.

> The problem is not enforcing tor, but using a select bunch of apps and protocols which don't leak private information over tor and whonix doesn't seem to deal with that problem.

If that is not already answered, please elaborate.
