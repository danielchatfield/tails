One month ago I had mailed the video footages of a female bonded labour being raped in a coal mine and inhuman working conditions of mine workers, but I mailed them with objectionable comments for the President of my country which is an offence. (In my papers I addressed the president as "foolish" and rapist) due to which my government had issued subpoenas to Facebook and Yahoo who have now handed over all the IP addresses list which the Tails had used for the last 40 days for all the activites. 

I have read the forum and understand that there is no chance for anyone to trace me because Tails uses encryption and encrypts all the IP addresses before sending them forward to other nodes.

My question is that the Facebook and yahoo have not yet blocked or removed my accounts and I still have two videos and 5 images in the drafts folder of yahoo account which I used as a cloud storage/online record.

Is there any risk in using the same accounts despite knowing that yahoo and facebook are monitoring and observing those accounts and my government is hell bent upon tracing me? Should I log on to those accounts again to download my material and delete the same or to forward the same to everyone immediately before the accounts are closed?
