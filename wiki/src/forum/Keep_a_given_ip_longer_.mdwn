Im using Tails 0.17.2 and i my problem is that Tails will use an different ip every 10 minutes or so.
On the forum on the website i getting regular a message that tp i use is banned. I have to right-click the Tor button en choose " new identity" 
some times it take a few clicks and some time before i get the right ip to 
go further,

I was wondering if i could stop Tor to use every 10 minutes a different ip.
Its not necessary to have a different ip on the website im.
Its anoying to change my IP so often.

Is there a method you can keep an IP for longer than 10 minutes?
