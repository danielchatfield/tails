I have found the directory which is:

/home/etc/default/kdm.d

and the file containing the default desktop wallpaper and theme is called '10_desktop-base' but it won't allow me to edit/replace it due to the permissions.

In no way do i want to go against any of the 'rules' of tails and edit anything i shouldn't but surely this is that big of a deal. Surely i'm just personalising it to a degree that will bother anyone? 

Anyway, if it's allowed i was wondering if there is anyway around the permissions of this file and if so how? 

Thankyou.
