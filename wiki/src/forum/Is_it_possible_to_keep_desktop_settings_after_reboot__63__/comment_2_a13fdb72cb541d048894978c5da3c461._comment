The problem here is the fabulous world of Gnome, which seems to have abandoned the standard *nix practice of having user-findable and editable program configuration files, probably because everything is supposed to be configured via GUIs so why does a user need to find the config file.  Some Gnome desktop and app configuration files have names that don't imply which programs are affected.  I've yet to find where *all* the files are that affect for eg the dreadful Nautilus's configuration.  This also makes things harder to fix if you start fiddling with config files manually and it breaks.

The lazy way to solve this is for most user programs is by making the entire /home/amnesia directory persistent (in which case you won't need for eg the 'persistent' dir or any other dir in /home/amnesia to be set to be independently persistent).  Bookmarks, addons etc are also saved, so for the most part Tails then keeps desktop configurations just like a normal system.

**BUT** Tails devs don't recommend this and won't support it, I suspect mainly(?) because:

1. Fragility.  It then becomes much harder to recover after breaking the wrong file in /home/amnesia.  So if everyone did this it will likely result in a lot of borked usb installs and requests for help.

Eg I've done this and then gone and - oops! - broken configuration files in /home/amnesia, resulting in a hung boot which I couldn't fix and hence a need to reinstall to usb, after first rescuing a few files I wanted to keep from /home/amnesia by mounting this on other system. So this is AYOR, you've been warned.

2. Hygiene. Should your /home/amnesia directory get infected somehow with malware, on a reboot it may still be there.  Not keeping everything persistent means you start clean on every boot which is a Good Thing(TM) for risk management.  Of course, this also affects any regular non-live-cd system using Tor, but Tails is supposed to have better hygiene than normal Linux installs.

3. Cruft.  Certain files accumulate in /home/amnesia and, again, this is largely an unwelcome product of Gnome land. The (literally) big example here is the infamous ~/.xsession-errors, which can grow to many GB over time.  This could easily fill your persistent home up.  It's not obvious how to disable this file but a script can be used to delete it every boot: http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=218008

4. Goals. 'Being configurable' is not really a goal of the Tails project, unlike many regular distros.

I'm not a Tails dev, so I don't speak for them.  This is just my opinion.  Tails devs may well have other issues to list here.
