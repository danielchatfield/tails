I booted Tails 0.17 on a Gateway laptop. Everything seems to boot up but the cursor barely moves either with the touchpad or the mouse. I am using a Microsoft wireless mouse. This problem makes the program unusable. I had the same problem with Tails 0.15 and was hoping that 0.17 would solve the problem. Any ideas?
