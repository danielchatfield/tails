Hello, 
I try to set Persistent and I see some options there to save network setting, .folders in home and ect. I test it in 0.18 usb boot disk but it didnt work. Only personal data, browser bookmarks and pidgin. Other setting looks not working after restart. Specialy .folders, when I install some addon to iceweasel after restart its gone. Network settings are after restart gone. Any setting of some program what use .folder in home is gone. Any help? Or Im doing something wrong or I dont understand it good.
Thank you
