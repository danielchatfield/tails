There have been several threads here in the past day on related topics, so you might search for and read those.

Tor nodes being operated by \"researchers\" or adversary organizations for the purposes of surveillance of Tor users do not neccessarily use MITM attacks, which are particular kind of attack on your web-browser which typically would try to subvert SSL in order to break or weaken the encryption of https connections.

Some descriptions of Man-in-the-middle attacks assume the connections are unencrypted.  Strong cryptosystems typically attempt to assure both authenticity and privacy; the former should mitigate the likelihood of MITM attacks.  Alas, practice and theory are not the same thing.

Tor (which underlies Tails) uses strong encryption for these hops in a Tor circuit (when you request a \"New identity\" in the Vidalia Tor controller you should get a new circuit, or at least a new exit node):
you <--> entry node
entry node <--> middle node
middle node <--> exit node
If you are accessing an https website such as this forum, the last hop is also encrypted; otherwise, it can in principle be read by the operator of the exit node:
exit node <--> destination.

I assumed that by MITM you meant \"man in the middle\" attack.  \"Meet in the middle\" attack, a style of cryptographic attack which confusingly is also known as MITM.

It you are worried about possible Man-in-the-Middle attacks, that is probably good, but the most important things you can do to prevent them (probably) is to pay attention to general computer security issues, perhaps by disabling Javascript entirely.  Tails (and also Tor Browser Bundle, which is part of the Tor Project) come with a browser security add-on, NoScript, which can prevent many attacks on the browser even if you choose to leave JavaScript enabled.

I may have misunderstood your post, but it almost sounds like you might have been saying that (out of curiosity?) you yourself want to create a rogue Tor node in order to sniff packets.  That would be impolite and depending upon where you live might even be illegal.  And if your log contained questionable images you could put yourself at risk if your rogue Tor node were seized.  Bottom line: I think operating a rogue Tor node is both pointless and foolish.
