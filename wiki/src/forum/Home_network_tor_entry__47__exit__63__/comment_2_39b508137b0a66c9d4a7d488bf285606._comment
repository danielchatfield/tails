>How difficult would it be to set up a Tor system on a home network to caputre Tor traffic from the network?

You'd have to design a means of making all the local clients use your \"rogue node\" as their exclusive entry node. That'd be rather difficult unless you had access to all the victim machines - in which case, why bother?
