What about ethernet (wired)? Have you tried that?

Ethernet connection should work regardless of whether the wireless card is supported.

You can try searching for your wireless card (the actual chipset, if you know it, would be best).

If the problem is merely the WiFi card, the easiest solution may be use to a USB WiFi adapter. (These can be acquired relatively inexpensively now) I have found that if a WiFi card has fairly broad Linux support, it will almost certainly be supported by Tails. Search particular models first before purchasing.
