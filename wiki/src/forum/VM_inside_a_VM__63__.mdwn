I have a question about Tails security inside a VM.  I currently have a Mac, which I don't complete control, which I use on a daily basis.  On the Mac I have a Debian 6 VM running in VMWare Fusion.  I do control this VM and can do anything with it.  Just this morning, I installed VirtualBox on the Debian VM and am running Tails in Virtualbox on the Debian VM.

Now, aside from the performance issues (which actually aren't too bad, given that I'm only using the internet and mail), what should I be concerned about, security-wise, and how do I minimize those concerns?  There's got to be a way to secure Tails in this VM onion, right?  Because onion is good!  :)
