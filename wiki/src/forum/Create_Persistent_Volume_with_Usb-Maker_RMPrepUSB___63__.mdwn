Since the new Tails 0.15
my computer is unable
to boot it from my usb. 
I used 

-LinuxLive,
-unetbootin
-yumi 

--> and always flashes a short white wall of text and windwos starts to boot if I select boot from usb in the boot menue
 


Is there an USB-BOOTPROGRAMM where you dont have to be a rocket scientist and can run Tails sucessfully ? (+persistence if possible ?)

Can you make persistence with RMPrepUSB ?
