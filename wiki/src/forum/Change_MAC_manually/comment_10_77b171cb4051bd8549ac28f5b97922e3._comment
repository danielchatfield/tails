To change hostname on the fly, you can use the *hostname* command. But to make some services work properly (as the sudo command itself), you have to modify the file /etc/hosts before: duplicate the line beginning with '127.0.something' and ending with your actual hostname (currently 'amnesia') and modify it:

    127.0.0.1 amnesia
    127.0.0.1 whateveryouwant

After what you can run the *hostname* command (as root):

    sudo hostnamne whateveryouwant
