he says in the terminal manager sudo macchanger -a
not sure what -a is off the top off my head
i thought macchanger -r was random
to manually do it i believe you just do in terminal
'sudo macchanger -m 00:11:22:33:44:55 <wifi device name>'
the device name could be mon0, eth0, wlan0, it depends
try typing ifconfig or iwconfig (or sudo ifconfig / sudo iwconfig) to see your device name..

and this is all before you connect to your wifi or whatever
i'm still learning and rarely use it but am fairly certain that's how it works
