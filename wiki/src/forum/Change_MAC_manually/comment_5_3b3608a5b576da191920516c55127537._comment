So which command would it be , \"sudo machanger -a ethl\" OR \"sudo macchanger -r ethl\"?

I found the device name no problem, but is there a method to check your MAC in the console BEFORE you change it just to verify that it in fact actually DID change it?

What about hostname? With Tails do they all have a pre-set hostname? Are you able to change it?
