Hi, how can I automagically install addons and search plugins for iceweasel? Copying to specified folders in /home/amnesia/.mozilla/.../extensions and searchplugins doesn`t do anything :(

I don`t like installing these on each startup from iceweasel interface - it is slooow.

P.S. Addon is totally safe - it is dictionary for spellchecking and searchplugins are safe as well.
