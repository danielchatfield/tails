If we are going to have persistent data we should be able to use different profiles for different needs.

In other words, if I want to use Tails for different purposes, I will log into different profiles each time. Some examples:

**a profile:** In this one, I won't do anything important, just for surfing web. I will install extensions and search plugins for Iceweasel and scripts for Greasemonkey which will speed up my internet experience. And some other stuff to watch videos/listen radio/music kind of.

**b profile:** Here I will do important things about assassination, terrorism, etc. :) There will be important documents on desktop, special programs installed, torchat installed and I will configure Iceweasel for maximum privacy/anonymity.

**c profile:** There will be pr0n stuff :)

**d**..
...

Ok, not good examples but you got the point. Different applications-files-configurations-bookmarks in each profile. Why should we have all kind of persistent data in just one profile? That doesn't look secure. For using Tails in a more public place we will create and use a profile like "a" and there will be no problem if someone watching you from behind.

And of course all profile data will be encrypted and will ask passwords to use them.
