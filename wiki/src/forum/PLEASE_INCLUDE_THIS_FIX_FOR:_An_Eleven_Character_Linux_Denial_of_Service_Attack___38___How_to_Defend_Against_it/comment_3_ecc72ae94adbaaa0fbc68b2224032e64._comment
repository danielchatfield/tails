I am not the OP (and didn't follow the link) but thanks to Commentators 1,2.

In my opinion this demonstrates the proper approach to \"debunking\" spurious security concerns related to using Tails/Tor: if it's irrelevant, explain why.  If fixing it might be worse than leaving things be, explain why.

This takes more time than mocking, but is infinitely more valuable to the Tails community.
