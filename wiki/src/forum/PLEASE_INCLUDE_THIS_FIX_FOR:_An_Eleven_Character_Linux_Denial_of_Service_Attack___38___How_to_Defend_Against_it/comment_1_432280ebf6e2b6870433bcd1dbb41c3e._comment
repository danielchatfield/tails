This has nothing to do with Tails.

To save anyone else the bother of following OP's link... It's a PoS about inducing someone to hang their system by getting them to issue a malicious command. Specifically:

    :(){ :|:& };:

...to produce a \"*fork bomb*\"

The advocated \"workaround\" is to \"limit the number of processes that a user can open.\" By:

sudo ulimit -u 512


Or by adding...

    *    hard    nproc    512

...to `/etc/security/limits.conf`

OP: There are inevitably billions of stupid things you can do to your computer to stop it working. An immense number of them far more damaging than that. It would probably be a sensible precaution for you to refrain from entering random commands into your system in general... especially commands you don't understand from sources you don't trust... and even more so into a system like Tails which you are presumably using because you hope to attain a degree of privacy/security!

Entering random commands you don't understand from sources you don't trust can harm your privacy/security as well as system stability!

If it's any comfort to you, patches to *properly* mitigate the \"fork bomb\" phenomenon have recently landed into 3.8 ...so this particular means to shoot yourself in the foot might be about to go away by its self :D
