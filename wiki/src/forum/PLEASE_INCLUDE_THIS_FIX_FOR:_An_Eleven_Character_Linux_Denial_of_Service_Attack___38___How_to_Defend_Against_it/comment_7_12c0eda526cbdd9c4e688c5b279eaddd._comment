>QFT!

For anyone who doesn't know, \"QFT\" stands for:
\"Quoted For Truth\".

This is used when someone wants to, at the same time, express agreement and emphasize the importance or relevance of someone that was said by someone else.

There is a generally-accepted literary rule or convention that the first time in a given place (such as an article, post, etc.) that an abbreviation, acronym, initialism or other shorthand that is not considered univerally-known is used, it should spelled-out/identified.

I would suggest that this \"rule\" be followed as much as possible on this forum. The additional trouble to the writer is so minimal as to be trivial and insignifcant, while the benefit to others and to the forum in general could be considerable.
