@ "Tails"

About six weeks ago, in a post in this forum, one of you seemed to promise to ask your sponsors to allow the Tails Project to reveal their identities, or at least to provide some information.

So, if you are permitted to say, who is "Sponsor Bravo"?

Is there a "Sponsor Alfa"?  Any other sponsors?  Can you say anything about their interest in sponsoring a privacy-promoting tool?  Such glosses are probably not necessary in the case of organizations which are widely regarded as pro-privacy, such as the Tails Project itself or Sonic.net, but would be particularly helpful in the case of sponors with ties to companies involved with internet surveillance or surveillance drones.
