Theres no sound botting from a usb tails 0.7 rc2

also I read the notes on the site re; duckduckgo.com browser

are you aware that duckduckgo.com runs a tor enclave?

since its also sure that tails is connected to tor instead  of having the scoogle ssl page as default
why not go to the duckduckgo.com onion page as default?

thanks for tails
