1.) How exactly does one add `toram` to kernel arguments at boot?

2.) After successfully booting TAILS into RAM, I assume that the disk can be removed?

3.) What are the respective *minimum* amounts of RAM required for:
a) running TAILS from RAM
and
b) running TAILS from RAM *without suffering any considerable performance loss*
?

Thanks.
