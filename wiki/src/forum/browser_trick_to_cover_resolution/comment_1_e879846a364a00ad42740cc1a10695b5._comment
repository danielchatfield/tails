https://panopticlick.eff.org/ I believe you will find your answer here.

Firstly... run the test... remember the output result.

Secondly... adjust the screen resolution... re-run the test and compare the output result.

Thirdly... tell us if this example test help you understand :)

By the way, you maybe be interested (require further reading on your part on the eff.org website ) that the resolution alone may not be enough to hide your uniqueness or the web browser track-ability fingerprint.

I may offer to answer other general questions relating to this if asked

Hope to have helped
