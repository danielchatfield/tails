Although the attitude wasn't necessary, I think the OP might have some good points. Why does a liveCD like tails need modules for extra/alternative wireless connectivity?  I'm fairly new to tails, and I really like it so far. I like the general programs that are included for an average user like me.  Perhaps a developer with more knowledge of the system could ignore the OP's attitude and address some of the points he brought up? Are the \"behind the scenes\" modules minimalist enough?
