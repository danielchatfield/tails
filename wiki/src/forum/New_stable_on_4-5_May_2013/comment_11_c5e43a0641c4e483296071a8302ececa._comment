F/U on the comment about FF crashing in gnome-3 under Wheezy when clicked on link in search page results:

Testing TBB-2.3.25-6 with LXDE desktop environment under Wheezy and not seeing that problem when disable automatic image loading and javascript.

XFCE may be slightly more usable than LXDE for TBB or Tails, if you like to keep browser in one desktop, network map in another, and iftop or watch in a third, because XFCE has four desktops while LXDE has only two.

It seems that offering either or both LXDE and XFCE as alternatives to gnome-3 may work reasonably well for future Tails editions based on Debian Wheezy.
