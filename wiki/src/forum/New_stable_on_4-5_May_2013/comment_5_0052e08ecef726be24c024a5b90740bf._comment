Hey Tails,

Thanks to the team for all your hard work.  Instead of inflicting the widely-reviled (hated) Gnome3 on us, have you considered using one of the popular and maintained Gnome2 forks such as Mate?

Indeed, failing that, Xfce would be far preferable to Gnome 3 and is completely compatible with mainstream Debian repo packages I think so shouldn't be at all hard to build in.
