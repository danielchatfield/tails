As was noted recently in a thread that has since vanished* for some mysterious reason, GNOME 3 is considerably more resource-hungry than GNOME 2. 

This will be a real problem for anyone using older hardware. 

I join with a number of others who have urged Tails to seriously consider migrating to a lighter DE such as XFCE or LXDE rather than to GNOME 3.
