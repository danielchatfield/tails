> Instead of inflicting the widely-reviled (hated) Gnome3 on us, have you considered using one of the popular and maintained Gnome2 forks such as Mate?

Using gnome-panel instead of gnome-shell will probably improve the situation, but assuming MATE is well maintained in Debian too, I want to put my vote there too.

Either way GNOME Shell is definitely the wrong user interface to use, but Tails developers seems to have already realized this.

My past experiences with Xfce have not been that good. The user interface felt random and low quality back then. They might have improved by now however.
