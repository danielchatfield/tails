> My understanding was that exit and entry relays are seperate and this should not occur

I found your post hard to follow.  Do I understand correctly that you were running netstat and noticed that a Tor circuit appeared to be using the same node as Entry node and Exit node?  Or just an Entry node and Exit node on the same subnet?  What did the Vidalia (Tor controller) Network map show?  Or is the issue that you don't trust your Tor software to be unmodified?  Did you modify your torrc to choose a specific Entry node?

You are correct that this is not supposed to happen but on rare occasions I have seen this too.  But I don't see why you are sure this happened to you.

As I understand the situation:

* all Tor users have several Tor circuits open at any one time
* it is permitted for a node to play multiple roles including Entry Guard and Exit node
* Chaos Computer Club runs many fast nodes which carry a large fraction of all Tor traffic; many of these belong to a few subnets including the one you mentioned

Consequently, I guess that you may have observed a node which was playing the role of Entry Guard in one circuit while also playing the role of Exit Guard in another circuit.  That gives me the shivers but it might not be fatal.

If you are trying to make your Tor use a specific entry node, that complicates the situation.  I am curious why you want to do that, assuming that you do.

I believe there is a torrc setting (enabled in Tails by default?) which tries to ensure that your Tor will not choose nodes belonging to the same subnet for both Entry and Exit on the *same circuit*.  This seems like only weak protection against amateur correlation attacks, but is better than nothing.
