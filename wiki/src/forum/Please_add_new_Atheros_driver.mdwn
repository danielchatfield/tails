Increasingly I'm finding Tails (and Debian Squeeze) are having problems with some new laptop hardware because the kernel and toolchain are already too old.

My new Lenovo laptop's ethernet is completely broken in Tails because its 3.2 kernel does not yet support newer Atheros networking hardware.

But the new alx and atl1c drivers have been written and released since April: http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/alx

This would need:

sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic linux-headers-`uname -r`

except the build process wants gcc-4.6, which is unavailable in Tails/Debian Squeeze.

cd compat-wireless-*-p
./scripts/driver-select alx
make
sudo make install


Can Tails devs please build both alx and alt1c drivers and add to the next release asap?  Waiting for Debian Squeeze to get around to this may well take take *years* though I hope not.

Similarly, usb3 has issues it seems, though this has been in the kernel for a long time.  I get a lot of "xhci_hcd 0000:04:00.0: WARN: Stalled endpoint" in dmesg,  which was a known issue with USB3 in the 2.6 kernel: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/647973

Hoping Squeeze backports will hurry up and upgrade the kernel but, if not, Tails devs could do new laptop owners a huge favor and build those drivers.

Thanks,
