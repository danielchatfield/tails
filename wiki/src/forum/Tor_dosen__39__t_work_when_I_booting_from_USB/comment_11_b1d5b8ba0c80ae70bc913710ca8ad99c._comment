Can you tell me what is the risk to use regular Tor without Tails or VM?
What is more safe option a using Tails from VM when is VPN first running before VM or a Just use Tor in regular way when VPN running first?
or maybe it will be good idea to running VPN then start Tor browser then disconnect VPN and then again to connect vpn after Tor is already running?

I ask this if I'll not find a way to use Tails safely.
