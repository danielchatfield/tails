1) How can i do that? what is the way to input VPN with tails like i need to?

When i trying to install programs on Tails it dosent work to me.
I also tried to install the VPN installer from another usb stick into tails but Tails can't read the file. When i click on the VPN file icon it dosen't able to read the file. So what am I need to doing now?

2) What is more safer running Tails from VM,with VPN first? or running Tor from Main operating system? when there is less traces and less IP exposure?
