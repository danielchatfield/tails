I thing your questions help me to understand finally what is problem but im not sure 100% yet.

In my regualar operating system I using VPN because of certain limitations that prevent me from using Tor. Its mean that I can't connecting Tor without to running first VPN. So when i booting Tails from USB is discursive on VPN running step and maybe in this way does not allow me to connect Tor.
So what can i doing in that situation?
Hope you understand my explanation.
