Does the direct (non Tor) connection offered by the \"unsafe browser\" function correctly?

Are you leaving the system to detect your connection and launch Vidalia and Iceweasel automatically or are you launching either of these programs yourself?

Does Vidalia's onion icon turn green or remain yellow?
