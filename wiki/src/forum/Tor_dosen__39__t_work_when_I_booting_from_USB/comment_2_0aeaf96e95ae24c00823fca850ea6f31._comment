1) I manually started the Unsafe browser and it works to me well. 

2) I tried both types. First of all i launched it in my self manually and after i saw Tor dosen't work I booted Tails again and I let it start automatically, and again Tor didnt worked to me and iceweasel show me the messages i wrote in my first post.

3) This is show yello and not become to the green onion icon.
First its show this message:
synchronizing-clock....\"Tor needs an accurate clock to work........ etc.\" 

Then after few minutes its show me \"could not fetch Tor.....etc.\"

and when i clicked on the yellow onion icon it writes that:
Establishing an encryption directory connection failed (done)

The interesting thing is normal browsing works well for me, did you understand the problem?
