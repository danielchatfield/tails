I believe so. :(

Could you give us as much information as you can (without compromising your anonymity) about your internet connection?

Do you have your own direct connection? If so of what type, company, country, etc. Or perhaps you are using a network managed by someone else - a company, library, etc? Please give all the information you feel comfortable to publicly disclose.

It sounds very much like your ISP or network administrator is intentionally blocking connection to the Tor network.
