Anyone have any experience in getting bitcoin to run in tails from the persistent volume?

I've got the full bitcoin client in persistent volume but it hasn't managed to get up &running, when i click on Bitcoin-qt it says 'opening bitcoin' but then nothing happens.

Anyone point me in the right direction?
