I have proposal, some people need more tools/applications than limited iso image for live cd (Live CD can be maximum 700MB), so it would be good to have one iso image for Live CD and other (bigger) iso image for USB. how much bigger I don't know, it depend how many applications are added, but most people today possess USB with 2GB and more. I think 2GB is enough for many applications. 
of course, I never created iso images, so I don't know if people/developers have time for that.
