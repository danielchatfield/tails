Correct me if I'm wrong (I know nothin about Russian keyboards :)) but after selecting Русский (which I gather is Russian) as language in the [[doc/first_steps/startup_options]], isn't the keyboard layout set to Russian by the default? Also, switching between Russian and English keyboard layout should work by pressing `Alt + Shift`, just like in Microsoft Windows.
