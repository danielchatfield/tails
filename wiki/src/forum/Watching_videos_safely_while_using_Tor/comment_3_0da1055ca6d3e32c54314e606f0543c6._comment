Newbie here. Do I literally right click the video and send link to downloads and then open with clive? I am trying to watch all videos offline weather it be from youtube or onion sites, etc. What about downthemall? Literally step by step how is this accomplished? I tried to right click a video and send it to downloads to watch offline one time and the file ended in php and I couldn't watch it where others it allowed me to watch with vlc media player. How do I watch those? Just wanna know the best and safest way while staying 100% anon. Thanks
