After I logged of of the Forum, I decided to keep looking for an answer, and I found it here at \"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/use/index.en.html.\" The page is titled \"Enable & Use the Persistent Volume.\"

It ends by saying how to get into the \"Persistent\" folder, which I was able to do.

I will try to come back later to let you know if I was able to save a program and some data \"as a test.\"
