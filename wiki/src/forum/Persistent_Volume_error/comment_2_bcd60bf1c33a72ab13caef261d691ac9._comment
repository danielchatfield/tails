I got as far as you did, and got the same errors. I deleted the persistent folder, started over, but took out some characters in my password, making it a bit shorter, and I was able to create a persistent drive (folder). I added a few non-communication (Internet) type programs that I really needed (as a test), and I closed down (logged off for good). Tails, and rebooted. I then put in my persistent passphrase, and my admin password, but when I got onto the desktop, nothing had been saved.

I tried to get into the \"folder,\" and I got the message, \"Unable to mount 'the name of my folder. /dev/dm-0 is mounted.\" I can't quite figure it out.

It sure is frustrating! I've been into computers so to speak since the 1980s, and Tails is one of the best ideas that was ever developed. I know that its creator and other developers are working their whatevers off to get it right, so I'm going to wait a little longer for some answers. Try to hang on if you can.
