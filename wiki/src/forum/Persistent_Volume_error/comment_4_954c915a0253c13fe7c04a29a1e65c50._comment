Is a little confusing.

You can only mount the encrypted partition in \" places\" when not using persistence.

When using persistence, it is already mounted somewhere in \"/ live\". Use \"df\" command in terminal to figure it out yourself.

Also there is a persistent folder which is accessible via the home folder. This is probably what you are looking for
