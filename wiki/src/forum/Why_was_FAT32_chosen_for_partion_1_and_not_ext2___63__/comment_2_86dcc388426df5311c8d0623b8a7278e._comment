The [[design document of the USB installer|/contribute/design/usb_installation]] says:

> The Tails system partition uses a FAT32 filesystem, mainly because it is the one supported by SYSLINUX we may easily create, in a programmatic manner, from Windows systems. This choice has consequences that are barely related to the USB installation task: the restrictions on filenames imposed by the FAT32 filesystem limits what can be shipped on the system parition (e.g. Tails documentation is only available inside Tails).

That makes sense if at some point we want to support using the installer from Windows.
