>There are a few webproxies that work will with TOR and SSL. One of the best and always working with TOR and SSL is Kproxy.com

I have just tried to access
https://kproxy.com/
while running the latest TAILS release (0.13)

Iceweasel reported the following error:

>kproxy.com uses an invalid security certificate.

>The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided.

>(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)
............................

Also, does anyone know what's up with 
https://www.webproxy.li/

?

For at least a few days now, it invariably redirects to 
https://50.30.46.238/11100001.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fcmyip.com&b=0&f=norefer
with the following error message in Iceweasel:

>50.30.46.238 uses an invalid security certificate.

>The certificate is only valid for the following names:
  www.webproxy.li , webproxy.li  

>(Error code: ssl_error_bad_cert_domain)
..................................................

Webproxy.li is connected to **proxy-service.de**, which hpHosts reports as hosting malware:

http://hosts-file.net/?s=proxy-service.de

I wonder how much of a concern this poses for a TAILS user with JavaScript disabled?
