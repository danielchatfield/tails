>Could someone verify whether or not what the understanding described by comments 4 and 12 with regard to using a web proxy in order to bypass blocks on Tor exit nodes is accurate?

I can't find any evidence of any real understanding of OP in either 4 or 12. Most of this reads like ill-informed floating paranoia.

The general \"don't do it\" consensus seems the most reasoned, especially given the context of info/understanding provided. The nub of the thread appears to be an as yet unanswered inquiry into how, exactly, OP intends to achieve a **truly anonymous** proxy.

If *you're* not interested in OP but simply wondering about routing *your* http traffic anonymously onto an open, free, \"web-proxy\", you should probably start your own thread, however...

>Specifically, are there any specific or special dangers that doing so poses?

Just for *your* webproxy *subset* of OP, a couple of top-of-the-head pauses for thought might be:

* Grouping all your traffic to a single IP address.
* Doubling up of MITM/injection/etc attack opportunity.
* Does your chosen service relay YOUR http**s** connection or establish one on your behalf? ;o)
* This isn't really a Tails specific matter. Perhaps you'd be better off taking it to a more appropriate forum. Somewhere concerned specifically with Tor or TCP/IP security or \"webproxies\"? 

>The way 4 and 13 outlined it sounds accurate to me but it would be good to hear from someone in the know to be sure.

4 & **12** again?

>@comment 13: Comments 12 and 4 patiently and clearly answered questions that had been asked in this thread.

No they don't. They address nothing of OP and fail to address any other question *in the context of OP*. They don't strike me as particularly patient either! 

>If you weren't interested, you could have simply ignored the posts. But calling them \"unhelpfull info\", as you did, was quite rude and ill-mannered. (\"With all due respect\", of course...)

Not sure why you've singled out a *comparatively* pithy expression of interest for this rebuke.

>(And I really hope you weren't the one who had asked the questions that 12 and 4 answered...)

By the sound of the post, your other comments drove him/her away long ago ;o)
