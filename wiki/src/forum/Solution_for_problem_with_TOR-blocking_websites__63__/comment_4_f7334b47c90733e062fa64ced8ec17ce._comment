@Comments 1 and 3: 

I am afraid that your comments show a fundamental lack of understanding of what the OP was asking and/or of the basic concepts in question.

As the OP stated, many web sites block Tor exit nodes (from posting, or, in some cases, even *accessing* any content). The OP's stated purpose for wishing to use a proxy on top of Tor is simply to be able to bypass said blocks; *not* because of any, \"inherent disadvantages in Tor\", as you wrote.

>If your proxy isn't \"anonymous enough\" after all 

Using *any* single-proxy-- no matter how robust and reliable it may be-- can never be more than \"one-hop\". To identify someone using a single-proxy, all an adversary has to do is obtain the logs from the owner of the proxy. Find me a proxy-owner who would actually defy a subponea at the risk of imprisonment, or hold-out against a clear and present threat of bodily harm... 

If all one wishes to do is access Facebook (or a porn site) from work or school, or bypass a ban, then a using a single-proxy solution (such as a web-proxy) may be sufficient. But any time having one's identity revealed could result in serious adverse consequences, a single-proxy is utterly inadequate.  

>then won't you be destroying all the benefits of Tor by routing your anonymous traffic onto it,

The traffic would be going through Tor the same way it otherwise would. The only difference is that instead of the Tor exit node connecting directly to the site that the OP wishes to access and/or contribute-to, the exit node would connect to a non-Tor proxy, which, in turn, would then connect to the desired site. Thus, the block on Tor exit nodes imposed by the site in question would be bypassed. 

> while still subjecting yourself to all the inherent disadvantages of Tor?

Again, I do not see where the OP wrote or even suggested anything about any, \"inherent disadvantages of Tor\".
