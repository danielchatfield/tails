>please tone down the feigned indignation a bit. 

I'm sorry that you detected indignation in my post, but there wasn't any. (Much less \"feigned indignation\").

>If you'd like to see your question addressed you might find charm and courtesy more rewarding.

I wasn't asking a question. I'm not the OP.

>So what is to be gained by routing your anonymous Tor exit traffic onto a proxy, when the operator will disclose the logs (your full session history and your identity) at the drop of a hat?

1.) If one uses a proxy **on top of** Tor, then the proxy should only be able to see the Tor exit nodes being used-- same as with any other site one visits through Tor. Assuming that Tor is properly configured and functioning, the logs should only show the Tor exit nodes used to connect; not the user's actual IP address. That is the whole point of Tor, after all.

I can't see why this shouldn't be the case-- at least in the case of a *web proxy*. Regarding virtual servers, employing one's own scripts, etc., as the OP is asking about, I am simply not familiar enough to know whether any special risks would apply.
 
2.) \"What is to be gained\" is the ability to bypass the blocks placed on Tor exit nodes by many sites. 

This was already explained-- repeatedly. I'm sorry if you really still don't understand but I don't know how this could be explained any better.
