I'm also trying to chain a tailing a SOCKS proxy (i.e. to circumvent TOR exit node blocks). In earlier TAILS version this was possible through overriding the Torbutton/Network settings and TAILS still enforced the route to the final SOCKS proxy through the onion network.

This seems no longer to work at all. Any hints why this worked before and how to achieve a TOR/SOCKS proxy chain ? A mentioned proxychain solution in an earlier thread seems to complicated and no longer possible since 0.13
