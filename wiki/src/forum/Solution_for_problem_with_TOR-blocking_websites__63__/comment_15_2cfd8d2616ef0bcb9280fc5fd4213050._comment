Could someone verify whether or not what the understanding described by comments 4 and 12 with regard to using a web proxy in order to bypass blocks on Tor exit nodes is accurate?

Specifically, are there any specific or special dangers that doing so poses?

The way 4 and 13 outlined it sounds accurate to me but it would be good to hear from someone in the know to be sure.

@comment 13:  Comments 12 and 4 patiently and clearly *answered questions* that had been asked in this thread. 

If you weren't interested, you could have simply ignored the posts. But calling them \"unhelpfull info\", as you did, was quite rude and ill-mannered. (\"With all due respect\", of course...)

(And I really hope you weren't the one who had *asked* the questions that 12 and 4 answered...)
