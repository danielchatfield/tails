@comment 16: What, exactly, in posts 4 and 12 did you consider, \"ill-informed floating paranoia\" ?

Simply pointing-out the *well-known* and *undisputed* weaknesses and risks of ordinary one-hop proxies?

If that is really how you feel, why even bother with Tor/TAILS? 

Using a single, ordinary proxy would be MUCH faster, wouldn't it?
