You can choose to install add-ons, but that can break anything; see

    https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/warning/index.en.html

Please note that to verify the authenticity of an add-on with Mozilla, your browser (presumably Tails browser in context) needs to get a certificate and verify it with a server operated by the Certificate Authority which issues the cert used by Mozilla for its add-ons check server.  But an attack which came very close to subverting that was spotted in the wild recently (see below).

So there are good reasons to heed the warning not to install extra add-ons unless you really really need them, because you run a genuine risk when you do that.

If you want to know more about MITM attacks on SSL/TLS conections, look for a paper by Christopher Sohghoian and Sid Stamm, \"Certified Lies\", which includes a snippet of marketing literature from a US company called Packet Forensics, which sells a MITM box to government agencies and possibly others worldwide.  The flier frankly states:

> Your investigative staff will likely collect its best evidence while users are lulled into a false sense of security afforded by the web, email, or VOIP encryption.

Their 5-series device is fully automated; any monkey can plug it in somewhere on the wires between the victims router/switch and his/her ISP's gateway.  It has no hardware address at all and can be powered over ethernet, and looks like an ordinary item of equipment.  (\"Less risk to personnel\".)  It can pass intercepted traffic \"out of band\" to a third party server by a stealthy 3G wireless encrypted connection.  All in all, designed for stealthy intrusions. 

In particular, there is no need to involve the ISP at all, so any snoop who has one (\"they're so cost effective, they're disposable\") can sneak into another country, stick in the wires somewhere between a home router and an ISPs gateway, and spy on anyone, *provided* they can get a bad certificate loaded by the victim's browser.

How can that be made to happen?  The flier explains that a certificate authority can be induced or tricked into issuing a fake certificate which the victim's browser can be tricked into loading.  Soghoian recently found that at least one \"trusted\" CA, TrustWave, has apparently issued a wildcard certificate valid for *any* domain to a large company, which planned to trick the browsers of all its employees (probably including their home computers too) to load the bad certificate.  This would allow them to use a device such as the Packet Forensics 5 series to spy on *all* https connections made by this company's employees (and maybe their children and spouses too).  No warrant or anything like that.  In this case, when Soghoian confronted TrustWave with the evidence, they realized issuing a bad cert valid for *any* domain in the world was a really, really bad idea, so they revoked that particular certificate, and promised not to do it again.  But who's checking?

Countries like Singapore or Iran are generally believed to mount MITM attacks to spy on *every* citizen using https protocol (the US/UK etc do the same to *some* unlucky citizens, but not yet on *every* citizen; if CISPA passes the U.S. national legislature this may change). In addition, some employers apparently mount such MITM attacks on their employees (if CISPA passes, this may become routine in the USA).  Last but not least, other entities apparently mount MITM attacks using genuine certificates issued by a real CA under false pretenses.  

The pro-government hacker \"Ich Sun\" allegedly used such a technique to attack Mozilla's add-on site.  If a researcher hadn't noticed the bad certificate, he might have succeeded in getting large numbers of people to download trojaned add-ons which appeared to have been \"authenticated\" by Mozillas add-on site, only it would have been Ich Sun's site, using the bad certificate.

To detect this kind of MITM attack, since the certificate is \"genuine\" in the sense that it was issued by a CA (or by someone who rooted the CA), you need to carefully verify every certificate you see and check \"out of band\" any which seem to be suspicious.  A certificate which says it was issued by the expected CA for a given website, but which is not the same cert which everyone else sees when they go there, would be a red flag.  (I believe that the bad certificate used in the Packet Forensics MITM scheme would have different id and signature from the genuine one, but welcome correction if anyone knows otherwise.)  The EFF has a project which looks for such genuine but bad certificates.

Also, I have no trouble customizing Tor Browser the same way you customize IW, in Tails 0.17-2
