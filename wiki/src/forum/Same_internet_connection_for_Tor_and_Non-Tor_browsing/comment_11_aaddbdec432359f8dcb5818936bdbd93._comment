>Would it perhaps be better for me to unplug my modem and plug it back again before using the internet with Windows?

*If* powering-off and on your modem changes your IP address, then I would think that doing this in between Tor and regular usage would indeed offer *some* advantage. Probably not much-- perhaps even *miniscule*-- but *some* nonehtheless; should make it at least a *little* harder for your Tor and non-Tor usage to be linked. 

I don't know why \"comment 1\" summarily dismissed this idea.
