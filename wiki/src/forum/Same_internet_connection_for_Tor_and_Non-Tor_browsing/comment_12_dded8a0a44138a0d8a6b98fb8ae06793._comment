Perhaps (I'm not the author of comment 1 either) because if \"they\" have managed to harvest the ip address you were trying to protect then your anonymity has *gone*. \"They\" would have no reason start trying to link their evidence to your mundane surfing when \"they\" could just pop 'round for a nice cup of tea and a chat.

Or maybe simply because it's not *normal usage* to assume that your anonymity has been hacked and to perform a series of bizarre retrospective mitigations *of \"minuscule\" value* on every shutdown.

I'd agree with you in that I can imagine some really unlikely circumstances under which obtaining a new address *could* be of *minuscule* value but they fall *way* outside the scope of OP
