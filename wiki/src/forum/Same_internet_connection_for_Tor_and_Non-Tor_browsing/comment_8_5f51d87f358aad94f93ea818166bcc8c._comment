maybe. 500MB isn't that much though ;)

Good/bad?.. Perhaps \"bad\" but indifferent unless you're expecting a raid or \"[cold boot attack](https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/cold_boot_attacks/index.en.html)\" ;)

[\"The devs\" are investigating](https://tails.boum.org/bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory/grub/) ways to make the wiping more reliable and robust across all possible hardware
