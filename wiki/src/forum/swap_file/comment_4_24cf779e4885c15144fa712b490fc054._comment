Regarding *swap usage*: given Tails has [[multiple layers of protection|contribute/design#index33h3]] against swap usage, whatever is displayed on your screen does not really matter **unless `cat /proc/swaps` reveals swap is indeed setup and used** once Tails is started.

Regarding *how to freeze the screen*: you may try the `Pause` key. Not sure if it works though.

Regarding *able to use \"Places\" to navigate inside my Windows XP folders*: if confirmed, this is indeed a bug that needs to be fixed. What is the filesystem used by your Windows folders? FAT32? NTFS?
