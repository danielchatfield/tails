Regarding the mounting of internal disks, I've created a [[todo page|todo/mounting_internal_disks_may_be_too_easy]] that shall now be used to discuss and track this matter.

Regarding the swap thing, Tails 0.7 indeed prints \"Activating swap\" on boot. This is a misleading message, as it actually does *not* activate swap at this point. The devel branch now has a fix that should prevent this buggy message to appear.

=> unless someone shows us swap is activated by Tails under special circumstances (which I deeply doubt), I consider this forum thread to be deprecated as of now.
