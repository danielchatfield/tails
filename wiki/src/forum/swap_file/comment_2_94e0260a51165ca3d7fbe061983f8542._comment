As for accessing the hard drive, I was able to use \"Places\" to navigate inside my Windows XP folders, while in Live CD mode (no Debian installation to the hard drive). This was not possible in 0.6.2.

The reference to the swap file being created was in Tails 0.6.2. I'm not sure if I saw this on the startup screen during the one and only time I ran 0.7 a few days ago, but I'm leaning toward \"did see\".

In order to verify this, I need to ask, how do you freeze the screen at startup for 0.7 as the information scrolls by? I'll need to do this and write down the line about creating the swap file, assuming it's there as it was in 0.6.2, unless there's an easier way I'm unaware of. I've also noticed at shutdown similar language about \"removing the swap file\", although I 'd have to again freeze the screen to see exactly what it says. 

I'll run the command recommended in the earlier reply as soon as I am able.

Thanks
