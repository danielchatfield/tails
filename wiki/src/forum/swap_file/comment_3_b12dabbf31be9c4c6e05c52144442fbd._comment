In previous versions of TAILS, as in 0.7, since TAILS is a Debian release and not Windows, you have to know the following commands for any Linux distribution to mount and access hard drives:

1) sudo -i
This command will engage the admin (root) account from the user level
2) fdisk -l (in root mode) or sudo fdisk -l (if in user mode)
This command will associate your hard drive partitions with device names

All further commands are assumed to be in admin (root) account mode - i.e. not user mode level

3) mkdir /tmp/<device-name>, e.g. mkdir /dev/sdb2
This command will create a mount point directory for the mount command to get access to the drive
4) mount -v -t ntfs /dev/<device name> /tmp/<device name>
This command will mount an NTFS drive and associeate it with the mount point directory (as its \:C)
5) cd /tmp/<device name>
This command will navigate to the mounted NTFS hard drive at \:C
6) ls
This command will list files and directories in the NTFS volume at \:C
7} cd <folder>
This command will navigate to a subdirectory/folder of \:C when positioned at \:C aka /tmp/<device name>
8) umount /dev/<device name>
This command will unmount the mounted NTFS volume (Note: must not be located anywhere in the
/tmp/<device name> folder/directory path (Note: the difference between umount and unmount)!
