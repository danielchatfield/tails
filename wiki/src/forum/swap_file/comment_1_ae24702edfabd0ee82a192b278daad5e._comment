What do you mean by \"access to the hard drive is apparently enabled\"? Only what follows in your post, or more?

Tails is not supposed to ever use swap. If it does, this is a bug, and an important one. Can you please confirm this by running this command inside Tails: `cat /proc/swaps` ?

Also, providing us the *exact* lines that tell you a swap file is being created would be useful.
