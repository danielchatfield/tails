I will do some testing later on but has anyone else manually installed the x screen locking software and used it?

How hard is it to use and install this?

How do you disable the ALT+F1,F2,etc screens?




How do you do this in a high assurance way, e.g. no special keypresses to bypass the screenlock, ie a solid screen lock
