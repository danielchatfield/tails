>If the person is so frail and weak, I doubt he/she has the lucidity and presence of mind to use Tails in the first place!

1.) One need not be frail and weak to suffer sudden lose of consciousness (seizure, stroke, heart attack, etc.) or even sudden death.

It happens even to seemingly healthy and active people.

2.) One could be \"frail and weak\" *physically* but still sharp as a button *mentally*.
