First try I typed \"truecrypt\". After failing and reading doc again, I decided to type \"TrueCrypt\" since that is how the case is rendered in that article. I will try \"truecrypt\" again. If it still not appear on the Accessories menu, are there additional recommendations for troubleshooting? I hadn't mentioned that I can see the drive and the TreuCrypt file/volume it contain in Tails, I just cannot get a selection for TrueCrypt appear on the Accessories menu. Thanks!
