OP: TrueCrypt working fine now. Don't know what specific operator error was before. I thought I had type very carefully, but evidently no. 

If anyone else browsing thread to help get TrueCrypt work in Tails, be advised that you also need create administrator password in Tails Greeter (widget form that asks \"more options - y or n?\" - setting admin pw is one of options). When you mount volume in TC, you be prompted for TC authentication for volume, then for the Tails adminstrator pw specified.

Thanks for the much help!
