I've been trying to create partitions on the usb stick that I install tails on.  I've tried several combinations on a couple different sticks.  But, none of them seem to work.  
The ultimate goal I have in mind is to have tails installed on a usb stick with another large encrypted partition on it so that I can boot up tails, unencrypt the partition, and then use directories and documents that are held in the encrypted partition.
I've been using both the terminal method for installing tails and yumi.  I've got a bit of experience with linux, but for some reason I can't get the usb to boot after I've installed tails and another partition.
Is this possible?  If so, can anybody help me figure this out?  
Thanks in advance to anybody willing to help!
