I agree with Tails and from my own personal experience and research.

And I disagree with comment from 12 especially as the person could not be bothered to provide any citations. 

But if do not believe Tails or me then i suggest you go to Tor Project https://www.torproject.org/ website and ask them on their questions and answers system via https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk
