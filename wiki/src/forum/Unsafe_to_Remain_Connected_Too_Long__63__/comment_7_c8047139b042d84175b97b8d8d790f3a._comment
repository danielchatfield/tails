Personally, it would be better to leave tails/tor connected for as long as possible.

Of course depend who your adversary are. As an example, if they would be watching the building you are in then I suspect they might see you connect and disconnect from the network at certain times and maybe by process of subtraction know who the computer user is. (your actual tail/tor activity would be safe). 

If you were to leave the computer on for hours with tor/tails connected and then you leave the building and return later then the adversary would have a hard time subtracting who the tail/tor user is. While at the same time you will also be increasing the security of other tor/tails network users (If you are using non-exit settings). (your actual tails/tor activity would be safe).

Of course an highly trained adversary could use other methods such as rubber hose or hardware keyloggers etc to uncover your activity.

The real question would be who are you hiding from? Is tails/tor usage illegal in your country ? Or even is your activity illegal in your country ? Then you may need to manage your risks and activities differently.

I suspect this might raise more questions than answers for the OP.

@OP by the way this is probably offtopic for the tails forum and for the \"tails\" moderator.
