@Tails (10): 
1.) The OP is completely **on-topic**. 
2.) The question asked in the OP has yet to be definitively answered. 

Since when is a thread that meets these two criteria closed just because some of the replies may veer off-topic?!

Do each and every one of the Tails devs claim that they never made any such post as described in the OP? If so, that certainly was not made clear.
