@ comment 8

I agree with your comments and your quotations of my comments I was merely speculating what on what the OP might be having issue with and to help the person to understand some of the risks.

Of course it is impossible for me to cover all angles as the OP is vague on potential risks they maybe be facing. Also probably was too vague on the counter surveillance issues.

If anyone interested this website https://ssd.eff.org/ - Surveillance Self-Defense

Is pretty useful happy reading :D
