I spent quite a bit of time trying to find the thread I referenced in the OP but had no success.

I distinctly recall that it contained:
- someone voicing concern over having remained connected and actively browsing/downloading for at least several consecutive hours

-\"Tails\" replying along the lines of,
\"We generally don't advise remaining connected for that long, as it makes it easier for the origin of your traffic to be traced. It is recommened, instead, to shutdown and restart....\"
