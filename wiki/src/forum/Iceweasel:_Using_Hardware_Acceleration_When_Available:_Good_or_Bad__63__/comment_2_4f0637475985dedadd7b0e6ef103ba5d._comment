So if video 'problems' occur to the user using sight alone, something bad could have happened, what makes you think malware firmware mod/reflash would show up as a visual abnormality?

Not a vector? I fail to believe this. Even you tip your hat in your post to the vector being possible.

This post is very much Tails specific, since the Tails Team directly modifies the browser's source and it is the 'window to the web and onions' in Tails.
