I'm getting the distinct feeling that most of the anonymous posters in this thread are the same person. So mature, make fun of someone and then post anonymous replies to your own joke about how funny they are.


 It's funny, a lot of posts on this forum are of the nature of \"if you cant figure this out by yourself, don't bother us\"
