Thanks for the serious reply. 

Yes, I have read a lot of threads about this topic already, and in the VPN topic, for example, TAILS said that they might one day explain in an advanced tutorial how to do this. All the other threads say things like \"It's very dangerous, it's very hard, it can destroy your anonimity \" etc. 

I understand it's dangerous, because if you rout through a wrong port or put the wrong IP adres somewhere, it's easy to leak your real ip adres.

But if you'd strictly use the right order to set up the chain and put the right numbers in the right place, there should be no problem right ? 

Or are there more dangers that I;m not aware of ? I would really appreciate more insight into this.
