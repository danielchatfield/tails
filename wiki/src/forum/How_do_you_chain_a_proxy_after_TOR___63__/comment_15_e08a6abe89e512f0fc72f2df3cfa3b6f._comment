>It's funny, a lot of posts on this forum are of the nature of \"if you cant figure this out by yourself, don't bother us\"

I don't think that's the case at all - here or on any of your other posts on exactly this topic.

More something along the lines of: \"what you're asking is **extremely** dangerous, bordering on insane - *if you cant figure this out by yourself*, you've proven yourself incompetent to attempt it at all\"

You'd probably get a similar reaction if you were asking how to turn fertiliser and sugar into a bomb. No one wants to help some poor hapless soul blow his hands off.
