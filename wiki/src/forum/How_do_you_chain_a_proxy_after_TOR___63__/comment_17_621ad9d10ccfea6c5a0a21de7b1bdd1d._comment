This message will highlights the different between jolting notes and creating a proper tutoral. But here's some hints on how it can be done:

 * Use something like `ssh -D 1081`. See `DynamicFoward` in `ssh_config(5)`.
 * Use `iptables` to allow connections to 1081 on localhost.
 * For websites, modify FoxyProxy settings to add a new proxy, before rules
   for Tor, that contains the addresses that needs to be reached, and
   which directs connections to 1081.
 * For other programs, draft a dedicated `tsocks.conf`. Use 
   `TSOCKS_CONF_FILE=tsocks-specific.conf tsocks ssh one.example.org`. 

Sorry if that's not helpful, but it's enough pointers for someone who wants it bad enough to read quite some documentation.
