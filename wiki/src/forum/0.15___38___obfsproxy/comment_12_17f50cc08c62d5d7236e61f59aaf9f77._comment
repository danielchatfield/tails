Let's be clear:

If I boot Tails 0.15 without the 'bridge' option,
Begin using Tor, Vidalia, etc., I may add
an obfs2 as a bridge in Vidalia and magically
Tails will now use a obfs2 bridge?

If so, may I go back to the obfs2 bridges
page and grab another and another until I
have around 3 or more and enter them into
Vidalia?

One other query, why is there no permission
for Vidalia, once you've added bridges, to
write to the torrc file?

Thank you and happy holidays.
