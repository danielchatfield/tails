Now I see what you mean. The `obfs2` pluggable transport is always enabled in Tails' Tor, with or without \"bridge mode\" enabled. So when \"bridge mode\" is disabled (i.e. the default in Tails), you can add an `obfs2` bridge through Vidalia and Tor should start using it. \"Bridge mode\" just makes this whole process less leaky (i.e. never connect directly to the Tor network) and easy (i.e. autostart a bridge setup wizard).
