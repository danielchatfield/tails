I am quite sure that I posted a comment here and now I cant find it. Maybe it was some connection issue after hitting \"post comment\", or that a mod deleted it for an unknown reason.

Anyway I will reproduce the content and hopefully would get an answer.

I noticed that descriptors of some obfs bridges are revealing about their nature, ones such as (I-am-a-tor-bridge). Are those descs visible to sniffers/outsiders (ISPs or other concerened parties) or just announcements within Tor? Can these descriptors be queried? If thats so, then the very idea of obfs bridges is defied.
