I have the proxy working fine:

cp -p /etc/tor/torrc /etc/tor/torrc.orig
cat >>/etc/tor/torrc <<EOT
UseBridges 1
bridge obfs2 [put IP here]
EOT

The above commands do it (use an editor instead of 'cat' if that is easier, and just type the lines up to EOT (but not including) in).

Do the above from a root terminal (Applications > Accessories).
