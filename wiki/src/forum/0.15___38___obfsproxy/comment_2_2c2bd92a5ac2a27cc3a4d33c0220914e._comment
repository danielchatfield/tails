I read:

>Support for obfsproxy bridges.

>https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.15/index.en.html

and:

>https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode/index.en.html

The 'bridge mode' page says nothing about 'obfsproxy' other than linking it to the 'Torproject page' here:

>https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports

I read and understand the article link @ torproject.org, but I'm asking here as it is about Tails 0.15 and noticed this on my box:

>~$ ps ax | grep obfs

>/usr/bin/obfsproxy --managed

Searching the forums here? Good luck, this is something new in Tails and I don't see anything related.

So, if obfsproxy is running, whether or not obfs bridges are used, is it doing something useful when not using obfs bridges or is it just loaded in case obfs bridges are used? If the latter, would we need to enter 'bridge' in boot menu followed by adding obfs bridge(s) for this to work?

If it requires obfs bridges and the user(s) aren't using them, then this process shouldn't need to be running all of the time if it's providing no benefit to the Tails user.

Thank you for monitoring and helping at this forum for this fun project!!
