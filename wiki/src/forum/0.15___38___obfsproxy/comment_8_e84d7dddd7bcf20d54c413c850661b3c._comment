no

>do you have to add an obfs bridge?

yes

**public** obfs2 bridges can be obtained [here](https://bridges.torproject.org/?transport=obfs2)

>If you are in bridge mode, added bridges, connection succeeded, then pressed \"use new identity\", what happens to the bridge?

depends how many bridges you provided. every new circuit will begin with one of your bridges

>or does that change the exit node and keeps bridges intact?

new exit (**probably**) and/or middle node (**probably**) and maybe new bridge (if you have provided multiple bridges)

>can obfs-bridge see traffic in clear text? 

no
