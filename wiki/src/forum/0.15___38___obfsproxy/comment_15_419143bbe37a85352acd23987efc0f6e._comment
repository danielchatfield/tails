>Dec 12 01:01:36.591 [Warning] Couldn't rename configuration file \"/etc/tor/torrc\" to \"/etc/tor/torrc.orig.1\": Permission denied

>I wonder why that is !?

Sounds like a permissions problem. I'm not using Tails ATM so can't test. You can always edit your torrc in a text editor if need be. e.g:

    sudo gedit /etc/tor/torrc

    sudo leafpad /etc/tor/torrc

    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc

    sudo vim /etc/tor/torrc

>If I boot Tails 0.15 without the 'bridge' option, Begin using Tor, Vidalia, etc., I may add an obfs2 as a bridge in Vidalia and magically Tails will now use a obfs2 bridge?

From comment 4 I'd say it sounds so. Haven't tested myself. Restarting the \"safe browser\" (restarting Tor/Vidalia) would be sensible ;) To ***ensure*** your bridges are used, comment 4 would suggest starting Tails in \"bridge mode\".

>If so, may I go back to the obfs2 bridges page and grab another and another until I have around 3 or more and enter them into Vidalia?

yes

>One other query, why is there no permission for Vidalia, once you've added bridges, to write to the torrc file?

dunno. [report a bug](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/index.en.html)?
