I miss a panic button in Tails. It would be useful if you hear or see a raid coming.

Normal shutdown takes to long.

Upon pressing the panic button shred all RAM. Do not safe unsaved work, do not ask questions, just wipe all the RAM and do not care if the operating system crashes.

Can you add a panic button please?
