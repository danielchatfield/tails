>How do I best reach the World Wide Web, step-by-step, through I2P with the Iceweasel browser?

Have you [RTFM](?)?

>Should the Tor Button be disabled/uninstalled prior?

no

>I note that Foxy Proxy in the browser Extensions does have available some preConfigured settings for I2P so, what settings to choose?

From TFM:

>I2P is integrated in Iceweasel in such a way that all .i2p addresses are accessed correctly through I2P while all other addresses are handled by Tor, all at the same time.

Doesn't this work for you?

>As Tails is currecntly configured, what IP address will show up in the 12P router directory (NetDB)when started in Tails 0.14 using the default settings?

You suddenly appear to be exhibiting technical understanding of I2P. Were the previous questions really necessary?

>Would it be a good idea to add a Iceweasel profile for I2P in Tails?

Doesn't this work for you?

>Last question, Is there a way to enable spell-checking in and proofing in Open Office? 

Yes. What language(s) do you need?
