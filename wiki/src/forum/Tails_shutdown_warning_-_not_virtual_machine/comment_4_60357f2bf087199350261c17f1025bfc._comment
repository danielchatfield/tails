The Spice tools offer services to people using Tails in a virtual environment - under a hypervisor. The \"warning\" is just those tools informing the user that they didn't function correctly - because you weren't using Tails in an appropriate environment for them. You didn't need them so the messages are normal and indicate *correct* operation. :-)

I think \"Camera/VM\"

Was suggesting you use a *camera* **or** a *virtual machine* to capture shutdown messages
