Today i've found smth interesting.

Imagine, there is some secure info that should be wiped and it is stored in Persistent directory.
Instead wiping a user makes "cut" and "paste" it to the desktop. Power off. Reboot. No info.

What happend to this info? Is it possible for a attacker to recover it?

"Wipe available space" solves the problem, but what if it wasn't done?
