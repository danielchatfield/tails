I also find it VERY annoying that the shared folders are no longer accessible. 

But at least my host is running ubuntu; so I just needed to install openssh-server in order to enable \"scp\" from the virtual machine to my real system.

I assume, that there is also some kind of ssh daemon available for windows. If so, you can run
scp something.local.in.vbox username@IP:/new.name

where IP would be the IP address of your host machine.
