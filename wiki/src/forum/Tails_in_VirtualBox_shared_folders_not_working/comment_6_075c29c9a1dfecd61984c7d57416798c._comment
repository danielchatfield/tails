Really funny i am a linux beginner and nothing of that works. If i put an USB-Stick in the host and say VB to use it with tails, tails does not recognize the usb stick. 
LAN doesnt work too and there is nothing but cryptic shit as an explanation for that..... 
If Tails has no easy option for transferring files out of the box (for beginners) its useless after the 0.17
