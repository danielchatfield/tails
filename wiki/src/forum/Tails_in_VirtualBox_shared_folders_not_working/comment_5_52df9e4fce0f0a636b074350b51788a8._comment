No OP here. With LAN you mean SSHFS? I was puzzled at first that my local servers are directly reachable at all. This was differente in earlier versions?

@OP: One workaround. Plug a USB Stick into the host. Using the VirtualBox menu you can attach/detach the USB from the guest, hence switching it between Host & Guest (it will appear either inside the TAILS vm or outside in your (Windows) host.
