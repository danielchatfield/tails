I tried two different USB sticks this morning.
One did work out in the end ( I could see it within the tails file browser and store a file on it); the other did not.
The one that worked ... was formatted with ext3; the other one was formatted with ntfs.

Another observation: right now I am running my laptop within a docking station; and although I plugged the USB stick in the same location; I am unable to get the USB stick to show up for VirtualBox. So maybe there are a lot of subtle differences that determine wether one can use a USB stick as workaround for the defunct shared folders.
