Hello:

I'm trying to retrieve a list of latitude/longitude for 6000+ addresses by using Google Maps API 

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding

This API has a usage limit: a query limit of 2,500 geolocation requests per day.

I thought to use Tails to workaround this limit ( because I guess, Google checks IP sender )
Its important that I use Tails as a guest OS on VirtualBox , runnint onto Windows 7 machine


So, I did a Java program and I invoke it such as 

java -Dhttp.proxyHost=127.0.0.1 -Dhttp.proxyPort=8118 -jar geo.jar com.geoMain

And I get "OVER_QUERY_LIMIT" when it exceeds 2000 queries

So, my Java program isn't anonymous !!!
Why ? isn't it using Tor network ? is always the same Tor node which requests to Google Map URL ?


Thanks and regards
