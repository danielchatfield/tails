[Readers should be sure to see the response from Tails, assuring that there is no cause for alarm here.]

Recently it was pointed out that cupsd and gdomap are listening on external ports.  Bad.

This suggests no-one has ever bothered to run a few commands to check what is listening where.  *Very* bad. I mean WTF?
