I have noticed that I only get about an hours use from my Acer timeline laptop when running Tails and it runs very hot, as opposed to nearly 4 when running Win 7.
I guess its down to win 7s power management features ,Is there any equivalent Linux power management apps that can be implemented in tails improve my battery drain.
