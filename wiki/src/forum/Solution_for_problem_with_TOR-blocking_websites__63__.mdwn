Tor is the one and only true anonymous network, but the IP-addresses of most of its exit nodes are blacklisted and denied on many websites. 

I think a good solution to stay real anonymous and still be able to reach and use those TOR-blocking websites, is to use TOR and surfing within the TOR-browser through an online webproxy. I want to have such proxy for my own and install it on a Virtual Private Server. 

My main question is which proxy script I have to choose if I want to avoid problems with connections through SSL (https//:). For example when registrating an account with Gmail, Yahoo or with other registration and order forms that use SSL. Is the cause of this problem Javascript?

There are a few webproxies that work will with TOR and SSL. One of the best and always working with TOR and SSL is Kproxy.com

Who knows which script Kproxy.com is using? And which other similar easy-to-install-script works also well with TOR and SSL? Is installation of such scripts a lot of work and does it require much knowledge of programming?

Thanks to all in advance for any suggestions and help.
