I second the request for loop-AES with its extra cipher modules.

It's very stable, much faster than dm-crypt on average and harder to reverse engineer a key by watching ciphertext get modified.

I have a feeling the loop-AES patched utils may not be compatible with the same utils used for dm-crypt etc, however that would require checking.  If so, just rename the utils so these can be called from the commandline specifically for loop-AES use eg mount.la, losetup.la etc or put them in opt or something.
