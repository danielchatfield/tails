Note that is you want a way to read your encrypted content in both linux and windows, you still can use dm-crypt. [FreeOTFE](http://www.freeotfe.org/) can read it in your windows OS (even if I'm not comfortable myself with the idea of reading sensitive content in something like windows, feels like a way to break the precautions taken by encrypted it) :-)
