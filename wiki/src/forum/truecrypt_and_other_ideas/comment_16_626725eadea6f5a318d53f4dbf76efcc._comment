I saw a page here about truecrypt about submitting usecase's to be considered.

And what I need is safe and central storage on my NAS, which I can access no matter if I'm using Tails or Windows.

While I find the license issue annoying, I'd find it even more annoying if I couldn't share files between my not-so-safe platform and my safe-platform.

If you can find a comparatively safe and easy alternative to truecrypt (including both password and keyfiles) it'd only be a small annoyance to migrate.

But I haven't found any, and until I am aware of an alternative, I'd say it's better to find an alternative way to distribute truecrypt that'd not conflict with the distributions ideology.
