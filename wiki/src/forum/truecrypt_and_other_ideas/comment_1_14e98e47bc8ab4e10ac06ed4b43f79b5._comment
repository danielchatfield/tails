About ntfs, all drivers are already included in the live cd.

There is already a [[todo item|todo/include_truecrypt]] about truecrypt, seems the license is kind of an issue. I guess the discussion should take place there.

To stop the tor routing of connections, you have to flush the firewall's rules, as it's configured this way (this is the only way to be sure everything is torified). Maybe this should be documented, but I'm not comfortable with it, as it could make people doing mistakes very easily. If you want a non-tor session, maybe the best way would be to have another livecd for this use, there are plenty of them out there.

The latest version has a bug with network-manager that was breaking the connection setup, but the next release should fix it.
