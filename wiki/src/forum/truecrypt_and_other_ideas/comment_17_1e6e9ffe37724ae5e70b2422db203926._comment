The [[recommended and documented|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]] way to
create encrypted volumes on Tails creates LUKS volumes, which are
supported on Windows thanks to [FreeOTFE](http://www.freeotfe.org/).

Case closed?

> If you can find a comparatively safe and easy alternative to truecrypt (including both password and keyfiles) it'd only be a small annoyance to migrate.

LUKS supports both passphrases (very easy, integrated into the GUI) and keyfiles (needs command-line I believe).

> But I haven't found any, and until I am aware of an alternative, I'd say it's better to find an alternative way to distribute truecrypt that'd not conflict with the distributions ideology.

It's not only about ideology. If the company that builds TrueCrypt were to stop maintaining it, the license would make it a pain, if not impossible, for anyone to legally go on with the maintainance work.
