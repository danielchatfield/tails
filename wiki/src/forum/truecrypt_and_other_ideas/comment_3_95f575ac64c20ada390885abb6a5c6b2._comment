OK, I will test proxy settings when new version will be released. Now it works off-line only (absolutely safe though :P). I also used Incognito because it was the only Live distro with Truecrypt, Tor and OpenOffice. I do believe that TrueCrypt is free enough to be included in privacy-focused system. For me - if source is available, program is safe. More encryption available - more fun.
