@ OP:

Are you using the Vidalia controller to examine the \"Network map\"?  That should show your three-hop Tor circuits (entry guard, relay, exit node), followed when you first connect to boum.org by \"boum.org\" or its numerical IP, which is the destination server contacted by the exit node.  (If you weren't using Tor, your PC/laptop would connect directly to the destination server.)

If you are using netstat or a similar tool to monitor the IPs directly contacted by your PC/laptop while using Tor, you should see the IP of the entry guards involved in your open Tor circuits.  Probably several will be open at any time, even if you are using only one of them.  

If you are using Bridge mode to evade national or ISP blocking, you should see the IP of the bridge you are currently using.

When you \"request a new identity\", your Tor client sends a special signal which creates a new Tor circuit with a new exit node, but possibly the same entry guard.  That's acceptable and even desirable for anonymity.
