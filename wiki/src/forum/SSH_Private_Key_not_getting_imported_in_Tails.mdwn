I created ssh rsa2 keypair without a password in Ubuntu 12.04 sucessfully and tried to import it in tails, but it will ask for a password while there is no password for it.

I added a password for that same ssh in ubuntu and tried to import it again in tails and now seahorse shuts down without importing.

Any help please....
Thanks.
