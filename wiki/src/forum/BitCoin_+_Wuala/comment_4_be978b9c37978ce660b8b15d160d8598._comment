for bitcoin you could use Strongcoin.com it works fine over Tor. the wallet/coins are encrypted with your own password, you can extract the coins in paper format and simply extract your key and use another program like Electrum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=50936.0 to transfer offline coins via terminal should anything happen to strongcoin.com

Wuala inclusion would be super kawaii rad though
