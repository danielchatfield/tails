You can use PLOP Boot CD or floppy if the bios will let you boot from any other device. Press F12 (on most computers) at the boot prompt. 

If that does not work you are going to have to open the case up (with permission of course) and remove the CMOS battery (looks like a watch battery) turn the computer on. this should reset the BIOS. Set a new password (with permission of course) or just leave it blank. turn the computer off then put the battery back in. 
boot the computer and go into the bios (F2 or ESC on most computers) and enable booting from the USB or CD (you may not have to do this step because it should be enabled by default). If enabled just press F12 at the boot prompt and select CD or USB to boot from.
