I talked to the guy in the central computer lab/help center and he talked to the people who set up the system. They said they put a pre-boot password on there so that no one can install anything on the computers (which also explains why firefox asks me to update it every time I log onto the computer). 

I specifically asked him if I could run a linux live CD or two to test out the operating systems and he said \"absolutely not.\" He laughed like a jerk and said, \"Why don't you go screw up your own computer and use our computers as they were meant to be used?\"

I guess he means for gmail and facebook, because that's what is usually on them.
