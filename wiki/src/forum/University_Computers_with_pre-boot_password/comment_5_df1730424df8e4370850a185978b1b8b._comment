you can use different tools to discover password.<br>
1) ntpasswd (Offline NT Password & Registry Editor)<br>
2) ophcrak<br>
3) UBCD4Win or Ultimate Boot CD<br>
4) Hirens BootCD<br>
maybe you administrator use the same password for windows and bios. I think windows xp you can discover password very easy but for windows 7, you can only reset, make new password. <br>
as people said, you can try to open pc case and move baterry and in that way you will restart bios password or you will restart order of booting devices (when I tried, bios was locked again when I boot pc, but order of booting was changed and I could boot from CD, so, i could not change bios password, I could not discover it, but after moving battery and switching off pc from electricity (20 minutes), I could boot from CD).
