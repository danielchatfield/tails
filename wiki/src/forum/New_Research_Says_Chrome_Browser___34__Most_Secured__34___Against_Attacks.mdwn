Firefox did not do well, which suggests that perhaps Chrome (or one of its variants like SRWare Iron) should probably be considered as a possible replacement for Ice Weasel in TAILS with all due regard to the security provided by Debian's releases (the cycles of which are slow due a slower security upgrade/fix release cycle).

This raises the question of which security concerns trumps the other with regard to anonymity: web browser vs OS and related software?

Is the Chrome browser compatible yet or not at all with Tor/TAILS approach to anonymity?
