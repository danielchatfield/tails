Hello, I have a little problem with my live-usb...

After having removed all the useless applications, I still not have enough places to do an upgrade...

How can I create it with extra-places ?

I currently have a 2Gb usb flash-drive and it only recongnizes 700Mb (size of tails).

Someone could help me ? Please ?
