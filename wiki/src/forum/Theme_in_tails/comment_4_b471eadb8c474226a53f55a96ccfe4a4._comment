daft definition:
silly, stupid, or mad, depending on context
or even:
senseless, stupid(again), foolish, insane; crazy, merry; playful, frolicsome.

I do not believe my comment fits into any of these categories. And if you have such a good reason for why tails should not have themes (or a few more beyond the blue and the Debian one) that I am missing why don't you share it? Who knows it could perhaps cure my daftness!
