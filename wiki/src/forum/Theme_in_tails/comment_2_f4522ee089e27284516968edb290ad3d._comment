A lot is perhaps unnecessary, but if Tails had SOME cool themes and a way of making them persistent or enabled in the greeter it would be perfect.

Let's face it.. It doesn't do anything for anonymity.. BUT, it can make users more comfortable using Tails.. which leads to using tails by default instead of worse, security-problem riddled software such as windows.
