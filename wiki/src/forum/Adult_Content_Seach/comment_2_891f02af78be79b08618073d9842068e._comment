I've gone to the Tails Menu:System:Preferences and I could not locate a submenu there for \"settings\" with a family filter check box. 

I've also checked the Iceweasel Menu Edit:Preferences and there is no \"settings\" submenu with a \"family filter\" option there either. 

Can you be more specific as to the locatation of the settings menu you reference? 

By the way, most \"adult content filters\" are optional settings and are not on by default. Not with Windows, my TV, etc. I am primarily a Windows user and I've never had a similar experience with any search engines or browser.
