I went to the StartPage Settings Menu and turned off the Video Family Filer and set the Web/family filter to \"do not filter my results\". I then clicked  \"generate url\". I then clicked \"here\" as instructed to set this URL as your home page. I then closed  and restarted Iceweasal to test. The settings had not been maintained and had reverted back to the \"kiddie filters\".

Any suggestion? I have v0.17 on a USB stick.
