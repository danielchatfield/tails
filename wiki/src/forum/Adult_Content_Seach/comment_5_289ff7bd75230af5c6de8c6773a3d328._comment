Thank You Comment 4. I apologize for my obtuseness. I'm a novice Linux user and none of the seacrh engines that I use in Windows has a default setting with a family or safe filter. Windows  settings are also accessed through the browser's menu bar. 

I am now able to turn off the safe search and family filters. 

Thanks to all who have reponded! Problem Solved!
