Hello! This is the first time that I use Tails, and it's a very good project. I use tails 0.13 from live dvd but when I want turn off my computer, the system ejects my dvd and the screen blooks for minutes and minutes and minutes, I believe forever.
If I turn off my computer manually by pressing the power button on my laptop after that system eject my dvd, do I risk of remaining tracks on my computer?
Thank you a lot,
a friend of Tails
