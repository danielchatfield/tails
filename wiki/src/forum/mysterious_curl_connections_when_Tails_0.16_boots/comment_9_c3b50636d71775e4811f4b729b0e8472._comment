About the name of our sponsors: I think we have decided to disclose
them in our [[finances reports|doc/about/finances]] when we're
allowed to (else, conspirano√Øacs will no doubt imagine the worse they
can -- on their own scale of what's better and worse); which makes me
realize we're a bit late in publishing our figures for 2012, by the
way. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure we don't want to disclose
every potential sponsor, partner or grant name, before anything is
actually signed.

To end with, please don't hijack threads with unrelated questions.
