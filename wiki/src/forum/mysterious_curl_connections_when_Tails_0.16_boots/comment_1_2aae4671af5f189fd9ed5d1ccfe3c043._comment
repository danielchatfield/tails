>The domain tachanka.org appears \"friendly\", and these connections appear to be intentional by Tails. But Sony? *Sony?* Really, Tails? What gives?

Isn't it obvious? *Sony* is **the** major sponsor of Tails. Without the Japanese paymaster, would we have Tails for free? Moreover Tails developers got to eat, you know. And it costs money to put up this website and maintain the fine forum.

In the final analysis, it's only when our basic human needs are met that we are then able to discuss about freedom of speech/expression and equality for all men. That's according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Trust me, *really*......

N.B.: I am not a Tails developer ;)
