Here is a thought provoking news story.  From

    https://www.infoworld.com/d/security/critical-vulnerability-in-curl-library-could-affect-large-number-of-applications-212532

> A critical buffer overflow vulnerability patched this week in the widely used open-source cURL library (libcurl) has the potential to expose a large number of applications and systems to remote code execution attacks.

I hope this is directly relevant to the problems I have experienced using TBB.
