These entries are 'htpdate' related.

Tails is checking and comparing for an up-to-date time on your system.

The results are output to /var/log/htpdate.log

Search for *htpdate* on your system to locate some of the files.

I don't recall whether this time check is proxied through Tor or not.

Why are you concerned about Sony when ThePirateBay is another domain listed in the same file?
