OP again.

@ 5, 9 (\"Tails\"):

Thank you both very much. this is very helpful.  Yes, this is almost certainly what I saw.

@ \"Tails\": 

htpdate, got it, very nice, thanks.

While I have your attention: in preparing the next edition of Tails, please look hard at AdBlock Plus.  That is a fine add-on, but unfortunately I think Wladimir apparently just did something which is possibly a good idea for non-Tor users, but which could be bad for Tor-users.  It seems that the latest edition of AdBlock Plus has added urlfixer (see urlfixer.org).  And I had trouble disabling it when I use TBB with Debian.  

I know all too well that URL hijacking really happens to ordinary citizens, but these days I prefer to manually spot check numerical ips and PEM certificates (at https sites), and I am concerned about letting any third party log websurfing, even if, as I hope, the urls they log are the Exit Nodes.  Similar concern with NoScript's ABE, also a good idea but potentially misused, and I notice that Tails 0.16 does not enable ABE by default, which I think is wise.
