> Isn't it obvious? Sony is the major sponsor of Tails

Fact or supposition?

For anyone who isn't following this: Sony is a major player in the anti-piracy wars, in which (it seems) anyone who uses peer-to-peer software (or Tor) is regarded as an \"eternal suspect\".  

Doubts have also recently been expressed in this forum about the Akamai Security Team, which has deployed a half dozen of the fastest Tor Entry/Relay/Exit/Directory nodes (geographically widely dispersed), and which is therefore is in a good position to potentially mount large scale confirmation attacks on Tor users.  I hope they are not doing that, but they do appear to have the motive and the means to do so, and even if their intentions were golden and their use of company resources taken on their own initiative (does anyone really think that likely?), I suspect they are or will come under pressure from their employers to use these nodes in not so nice ways.

On the other hand, Tor itself originated in the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, yet seems to have mostly escaped from the direct control of the U.S. Navy.  The American coporate sphere and its biggest client government are large and complex organizations, with many internal rivalries, which can sometimes work to the advantage of the beleagured People.
