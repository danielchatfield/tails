@ \"Tails\": is that true?  Sony is a corporate sponsor for Tails development?

I hope you can honestly and firmly answer \"is not, and never will be\".

But perhaps it is time to consider to clarify the source(s) of Tails funding:

* \"Sponsor Bravo\"?  Can you clarify whether that is \"bravo\" and in \"alfa bravo charlie\"?
* If so, who is \"Sponsor Alfa\"?  Is there a \"Sponsor Charlie\"?  A \"Sponsor Nevada Sierra Alfa\"?  Maybe a \"Sponsor Mike Juliet Mike\"?

(Tongue only half in cheek.)
