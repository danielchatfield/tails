While I'm not certain either I am about 90% sure it is put trough Tor since one of Tails main goals is to never transmit anything in the clear ever (unless you use the unsafe browser)

And No, you don't need to synch the time in order to connect to Tor itself, the timesynch is only needed to connect to .onion domains.
