> I think Wladimir apparently just did something which is possibly a good idea for non-Tor users, but which could be bad for Tor-users. It seems that the latest edition of AdBlock Plus has added urlfixer (see urlfixer.org). And I had trouble disabling it when I use TBB with Debian.

Thanks for the heads up, but pretty *please*, don't hijack random threads with unrelated discussion.

As far as I can see, xul-ext-adblock-plus 2.2-1 comes with this feature disabled by default.
Still, I've explicitly added `user_pref(\"extensions.adblockplus.correctTypos\", false);` to our configuration, in case upstream turns it on later.
