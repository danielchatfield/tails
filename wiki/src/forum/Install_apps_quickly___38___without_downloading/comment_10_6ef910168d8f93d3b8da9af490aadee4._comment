Oh my god, thank you for this. I know nothing about code writimg, and didn't have a clue how to install any programme in Tails. Tails is a great resource, but it kind of assumes the user has knowledge that the lay man just doesn't possess. It took me a little time to work out how to do what was said here, but am amazed that I got it to work. Thanks again!
