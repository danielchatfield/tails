>Can I use TAILS with a sense of security to send an email to Investigation agencies?

I think that would be difficult to answer without knowing more about your potential adversaries and their capabilities.

One thing is for sure, though: Neither Tails, Tor nor anything else *alone* can help if one doesn't take certain basic precautions. Be sure to read through and understand the warnings in the documentation.

I sympathize with the dilemma you face and can only admire your interest in helping. I hope you'll be able to make the right decision and wish you well.
