I am really shocked to read the comment 1 to the OP. If Tails can not be used to save the human beings, what the hell is the purpose of Tails or Tor or so-called vpns? Why so many conferences and presentations to the human rights activists if you can not grant protection to them?

We use Tails for childish pranks with friends and others and till date did not care to think more about this anonymity or security point of view. But this post has made me realized that all the efforts being made by everyone in showcasing their projects or techniques is mere an attempt to collect donations and when it comes to real life situations for which one needs help of Tails, you are start pointing him to visit threat model or loopholes.
