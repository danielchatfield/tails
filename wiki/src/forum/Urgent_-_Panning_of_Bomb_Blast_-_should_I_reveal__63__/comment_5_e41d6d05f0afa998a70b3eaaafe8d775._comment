Read this reply of TAILS:

\"Let me put it like this, without going into any nitty gritty details about thread models etc. which seems to be to much to ask for: Tor is arguably your best choice when it comes to online anonymity, and Tails is about as good an environment can get for using Tor. I hope that helps\"

This reply is enough for you to send emails and protect the precious lives of the people. Act soon and get those scoundrels and terrorists arrested asap. We should not be lax in disclosing such sensitive issues to the law enforcement agencies.
