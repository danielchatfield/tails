\">\": I think that would be difficult to answer without knowing more about your potential adversaries and their capabilities. \">\":


Potential Adversaries and capabilities of which country?  The country of EXIT node, or the country which has launched the investigation to trace a Tails user?

2. 
Here I reside in a country where my government can at most spend US$ 20000 for investigation or this is the amount that it can pay to the countries of all the nodes which they may appear during investigation. Is this amount enough?

3.

Secondly, I do not understand one thing. in some discussions the members say that everything is encrypted and even user-agents are also encrypted and the middle node can not decrypt it. So why the same useragents?

4. If the encryption can't be decrypted, what to worry about?

5. If there is no Man-in-the-middle attack or real time attack to trace a user and investigative agencies get to know about the exit node after a month, is there still any security danger involved?
