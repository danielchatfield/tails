I like the amnesic aspects of Tails but is it also possible to use VPN in Tails? So only VPN without connecting to the TOR network. If possible, how to do it exactly?

Which other Live Linux USB OS is good for using VPN? Any suggestions or experiences? 

When using another Live USB OS than Tails for using a VPN, then which free tools are available to wipe the RAM-memory of the computer that is used with a live usb of any Linux distro? What kind of traces are left on the RAM of a PC when using a live usb OS?
