If the chat is in the web browser then no. As mentioned above, the Java plugin is not included, and for good reasons: Java can deanonymize you. So a Java plugin will probably never be included in Tails.

(BTW, Java and JavaScript are two *completely* different things. JavaScript is available in the Tails web browser, however, because it's possible to make it secure thanks to Torbutton.)
