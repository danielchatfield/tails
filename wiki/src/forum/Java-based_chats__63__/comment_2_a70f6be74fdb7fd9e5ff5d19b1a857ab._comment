Thanks for the reply.  I do appreciate it.

The particular Java client I am talking about is that offered by ParaChat (http://parachat.com/).  Many sites have a Parachat embedded on a page in which visitors can utilize.

Is there anyway to route this through Tor on the Tails system or is it simply not do-able due to security?

Thank again.
