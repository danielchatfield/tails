Just noticed FireGPG is no more. RIP

Sorry OP.. I'd take that last comment back - if I could!

Morse still isn't a cipher. With with regard to your broader point however, I agree. A nice, versatile, Gnupg GUI would be handy... and now seems a rather glaring omission!


I'm sure [GPA](http://gnupg.org/related_software/gpa/index.en.html) *used* to offer symmetrical encryption. Seems to have been limited to public-key cryptography only now though. :-( ...it's in the repos if you'd like to try it.

    sudo apt-get install gpa

Perhaps a Tails bod might have a squint at [Pyrite](https://github.com/ryran/pyrite)?
