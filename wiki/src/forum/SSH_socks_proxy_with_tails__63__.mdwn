Hi

I'm looking to create an ssh socks proxy from within tails, and to change the socks port in iceweasel, so that I browse the internet with the IP of the ssh host rather than an external tor node.

If I use the following: (which I usually do on my 'non live cd' system)

amnesia@amnesia:~$ torify ssh -ND 9999 user@host

I get the following message:

15:56:18 libtorsocks(5325): connect: Connection is to a local address (127.0.0.1), may be a TCP DNS request to a local DNS server so have to reject to be safe. Please report a bug to http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/issues/entry if this is preventing a program from working properly with torsocks.
FATAL: Unable to connect to relay host, errno=0
ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host


if I use:

amnesia@amnesia:~$ ssh -ND 9999 user@host

I have this message:

bind: Cannot assign requested address

I don't understand - why can't it bind?

if I use:

ssh -4 -ND 9999 user@host 

it works, but then no way to change the proxy port in iceweasel. Well, I can change it, either clicking on preferences in the torbutton, or going to edit>preferences, but my browsing still goes through tor and doesn't go through my SSH tunel.

I'd like to know why it doesn't work? Is it impossible in tails to change the proxy port? If so, why?

Thanks :)
