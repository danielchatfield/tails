> Will tails run on a Raspberry Pi?

Not for now. At the moment Tails is only available for the x86 and x86_64 architechtures, while the Raspberry Pi is based on ARM.

> If not are there any tablets that can run tails? 

Any tablet with an AMD/Intel processor should do I think (just make sure it's processor is x86 or x86_64), and make sure it has at the very least 768 MB of RAM (but 1 GB+ is recommended). To be really sure you'll get something useful, make sure that its wifi chipset/3G modem is supported in Linux.
