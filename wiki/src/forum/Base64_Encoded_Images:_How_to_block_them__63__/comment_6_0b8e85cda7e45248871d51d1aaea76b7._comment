Tails is aiming for the general case. Users are used to have images in their browser loaded automatically. Not doing so is an advanced use case (and also a reducing your anonymity set), so this is not a major issue from the Tails point of view.

But this is a real problem in Firefox. I strongly suggest you fill a report. That should take 10 minutes maximum.
