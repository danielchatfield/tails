javascript is always disabled in my browser, these images continue to load with image loading disabled in my browser.

google news is but one example of a site which loads these base64 images even though you've disabled javascript and image loading.

i would like to know why these images exist on many sites and how they may be disabled in Tails as I view this as a potential security/privacy issue.
