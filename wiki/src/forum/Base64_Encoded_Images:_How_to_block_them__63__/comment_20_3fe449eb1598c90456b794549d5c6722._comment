Since the goals of Liberté and Tails appear to be closely linked, I'd suggest a new distro formed from a merging of the two and a discontinuation of the present Liberté and Tails. This won't happen, but it's a nice thought.

Liberté's web forum won't load for me in Tor.

IMO Midori should be looked at by the Tails devs as a possible replacement for IW, unless this would break the cooperation of working with the Tor devs and IW/FF ESR. 

Maybe someone could visit their [Midori] site and ask them about this issue?
