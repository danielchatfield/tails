i dont have the patience to file a bug report with mozilla at the moment, maybe someone else can?

is there a way to create a work around/sloppy patch to fix this in the browser included in Tails?

Please bring this up on your developer ML as this could be a very bad bug, and maybe post it to tor's or-talk ML.
