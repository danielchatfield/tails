Just had a scan through about:config and there doesn't seem to be anything pertinent. Could well be an oversight in Mozilla's design... I second the \"file a bug\" motion ;o)

If you want to read up on the technique, it's known as a \"data URI\" 

As for exploits, I'm not aware of any *known* vulnerabilities right now but don't see why a 0day in the image rendering libraries wouldn't be vulnerable to inline images. If you want a **real** text only browser, use *Lynx*
