>simple workaround use Adblock should work

Adblock is live on the Tails session.

Are you suggesting these images may be blocked manually via Adblock?

If so, how?

If you post a working solution, should Tails ship with Adblock configured to block these images or could this feature be switched on as a toggle when Images are Disabled within the browser?
