>This forum is about Tails

And Tails includes a browser (IW) which is vulnerable to this attack vector. You also modify IW's source, correct? Then you have a stake in fixing this issue if possible.

This is a security issue and Tails users should be informed it exists and progress on a patch should be announced in changelogs (under existing issues and when a patch has been made).

While I appreciate the Tails dev(s) responding to the OP, what we need are solutions, not throwing up hands and stifling of related discussion AS IT PERTAINS TO TAILS.
