This has been a known \"trivial\" bug since 2006. Looking it over, it appears that the security benefit of being able to reduce ones browser's attack surface might have been overlooked. Or perhaps we've missed something!

The best way to get something done about this would be to create a Bugzilla account and *explain* the necessity (don't nag - just explain the *need* and the impications which *seem* to have been missed)

The bug is [331257](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=331257). While you're there you might also be interested in [255107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=255107) and [786275](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=786275).
