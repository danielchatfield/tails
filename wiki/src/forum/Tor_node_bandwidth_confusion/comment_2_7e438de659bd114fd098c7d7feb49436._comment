@ comment 1:

I'm not sure if you're serious or not but doesn't *everyone* who runs Tor for any length of time *inevitably* stumble across rogue nodes?

As I understand it, Tor is designed with this taken account, so that merely encountering rogue nodes should not, in and of itself, break the anonymity that Tor provides.
