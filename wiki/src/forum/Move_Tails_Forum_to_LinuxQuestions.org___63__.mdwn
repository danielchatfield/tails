I just noticed that the [LinuxQuestions forums](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions) has an 
[Incognito subforum](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/incognito-85/)
which appears to be abandoned. The most recent post is dated 09-02-2011 and there is a sticky, [Incognito is dead! Long live T(A)ILS!](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/incognito-85/incognito-is-dead-long-live-t-a-ils-801614/) that gives the [old Amnesia URL]( https://amnesia.boum.org/) (which redirects to tails.boum.org)

This gave me the idea: What about moving the Tails forum to LinuxQuestions? 

Perhaps on a trial basis?
