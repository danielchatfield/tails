I would also be curious as to the process for making mac bootable usbs. Perhaps you could try another debian live CD that has some instructions for mac or a user forum to as qustions and apply what you learn there to here. In fact, any kind of instructions for other distros should be relevant to some level.

Also, if you stick t the CD and have 3-4gb of ram on your mac, you can append the \"toram\" boot option and everything loaded from the CD will be loaded into ram. The result should be very snappy...
