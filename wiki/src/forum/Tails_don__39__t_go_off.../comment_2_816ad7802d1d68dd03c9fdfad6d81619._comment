Hello to you too :o)

Those final stages of the shutdown are wiping *volatile* memory. i.e. System RAM and video RAM. Even if this wiping has completely failed, it's only of any real bearing if there's an *immediate* risk of your adversary smashing into the room and plunging your machine into a vat of liquid nitrogen. Perhaps also if you are going to *immediately* re-boot into a malignant system.
