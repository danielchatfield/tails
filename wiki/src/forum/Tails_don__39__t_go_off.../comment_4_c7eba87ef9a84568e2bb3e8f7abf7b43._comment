>Then if I restart my computer my ram will be clean, right?

The screen corruption is the video ram being wiped - so it would *appear* that the wiping is proceeding correctly. I can't really offer more reassurance based on the information available. There was recently a cunning plan to change the wiping routine to a Grub2 kernel complete with a nice visual progress bar but is seems to have hit a snag (?) :(

In the meantime, if you wish to immediately reboot into another OS and are concerned that the other system might attempt to harvest Tails data from unused RAM, you could always run a pass of memtest86+ after terminating Tails... just to be absolutely certain there's nothing left! ;o)

>Other question, when I used tails I did a mistake, I clicked my hard drive and system ask me a password, I didn't put it, and I didn't move any file in this hard drive, I had left traces? (for example, in hypothetical log file).

No. Without entering the Tails root password no filesystems would have been mounted.
