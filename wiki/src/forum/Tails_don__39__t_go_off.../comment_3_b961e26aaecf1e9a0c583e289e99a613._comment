Thank you a lot for your answers, I tryed to use tails today and I have the same problem, the screen becomes corrupted, but the system don't go off. Then if I restart my computer my ram will be clean, right? 
Other question, when I used tails I did a mistake, I clicked my hard drive and system ask me a password, I didn't put it, and I didn't move any file in this hard drive, I had left traces? (for example, in hypothetical log file).
I apologize for the stupids question
