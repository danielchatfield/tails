\"I wonder if all the traffic of random.org, hotbits (fourmilab), diceware, and all the other online random number sources, gathered via spoofed SSL certs of course, is forming part of the pile.\"  

Well, if the NSA's boasts are credible, they are teeing all packets sent inside the US (and as many as they can grab from outside the US) to their servers, performing rudimentary analyses on the fly, and directing the \"possibly interesting\" packets to long term storage for possible later sophisticated analysis, and for re-analysis as neeed.

I agree that there are strong indications that the NSA is an accomplished author of practical collision attacks on hash algorithms, and it is signficant that analysis of state-sponsored malware like Stuxnet, Gauss, Flame, Mini-Flame, includes suggestions of a sophisticated collision attack used to generate a genuine (but improperly generated) certificate, as part of a malware injection scheme.

Solid information about the storage/processing capabilities of NSA facilities is hard to come by, but enough is known to conclude with some confidence, I think, that while the NSA unquestionably has the goal (absurd, I hope) of hoovering up all the worlds packets for indefinite storage, even with the Utah Data Center and several other new facilities, they are several orders of magnitudes short of being able to store or analyze in detail all US packets.  I encourage everyone to attempt their own back-of-the-envelope computations based upon estimates of the amount of data currently traversing the US backbone, which can be compared with what James Bamford has learned about the capabilities of the Utah Data Center and some other facilities.

By the way, when the NSA claims that it \"does not keep dossiers on US citizens\", it appears that this statement is factually correct but also seriously misleading.  Numerous sources, including a lengthy article by a friendly reporter granted access to some Fusion Centers (take that for what you will) but also leaked documents which may be more credible, consistently suggest that what happens in NSA analysis centers, state/local Fusion Centers, and commercial intelligence centers (TrapWire and others), is more like the temporary web page created by a search engine when you search: data is pulled from multiple databases each holding vast amounts of information on everyone, and combined into a detailed dossier focusing on an individual citizen.  So no dossier is STORED, but one is recreated on the fly every time your name comes up in a federal, state/local, or commercial fusion center.  Which apparently happens far more often than most Americans believe.

As an example of what I mean by commercial intelligence, besides the well known example of TrapWire: quite a few companies which sell data to the US government for police and domestic intelligence surveillance purposes also sell it to companies for the purpose of repossessing a car, stuff like that.  When I looked into the companies which collect and resell license plate data, for example, I almost fell out of my seat when I saw how extensive are the records of a dozen or so of the larger competing companies, according to their own marketing documents.  These companies are not just collecting data from red light cameras; they have mounted automatic license plate readers on police cruisers, taxicabs, and even vehicles purpose built to drive around scanning tabs of cars parked in the lots of supermarkets, apartment complexes, and residential neighborhoods.  Next time you see a police cruiser, look under the light bar for four devices about the size of a hand-- those are the license plate readers.  If you spot them, your local police deparment most likely sells the data it collects as their cruisers drive around all day to a commericial broker, which resells the data to repo men and others who are willing to pay for it.

According to the friendly reporter, when an analyst at a state/local Fusion Center processes a suspicious activity report, he/she can access \"instantly\" banking records and other personal financial information, emails and text messages, websurfing logs, call graph, travel history, personal medical information, family history, biometric information, court records, and any previous Suspicious Activity reports.  After a half hour or so (says the friendly reporter), the analyst typically concludes that the incident under review does not suggest \"a nexus with terrorism\".  But may be refer the incident to other police agencies for investigation of other \"suspected crimes\", such as possible copyright infringement.  (That might be something to consider when you think about peer-to-peer while using Tails, since this is a different and apparently easily recognized protocol.)  

The ACLU has long warned of \"mission creep\" fostered by hard-to-deny demands from detectives investigating serious crimes, suspected gang activity, etc., and even worse, by intense pressure on Fusion Centers to justify their very existence given their absolutely abysmal record in preventing terrorism, gang violence or in any other aspect of their stated mission.  (If they can get their official brief extended to copyright infringment, they may or may not have better luck coming up with statistics suggesting they are actually accomplishing something desired by their authoritarian masters.)

Fusion Center analysts are typically employed by a contractor, not by a police agency.   They often have recent military experience in intelligence or interrogation units, and leaked memos consistently suggest that many people with this background are eager to apply inside the US the \"special techniques\" which they used overseas, such as CVSA.

Scary, eh?  It should be said that there are also plenty of indications that the friendly reporter overstated how smoothly all this information sharing really works.  Other documents suggest that in practice, analysts may not find it so easy to obtain detailed personal medical records as the reporter suggested, for example.  I hope those other documents are correct, and I hope that the US political establishment decides to eliminate the Fusion Centers on the grounds that the price of several dozen billions per year (or the rampant violations of civil liberties and the clearly un-american mission creep) does not justify their existence, especially given the shoddy quality of their \"intelligence\" and their apparently complete failure to prevent a handful of genuine terrorism incidents and a rash of gang violence. 

But to come back to the point about a specific feature of the Utah Data Center which may involve long term storage of a very long sequence of \"hard-coded\" \"random numbers\" to be used over and over, if true, that is probably related to a general cryptanalytic technique.  In his recent profile, James Bamford mentioned an alleged \"breakthrough\" by the NSA in this area some years ago, and I have heard several educated guesses about what that breakthough might be and what it might imply for SSL and Tor.  My own guess is based upon a glaring gap in the open literature on cryptanalysis coupled with NSA grants for research on a specific topic which has cryptanalytic applications (applications which are strangely never mentioned in the open literature, although I've spotted some hints that outsiders know what's what.)  I don't think I want to say more than that, though: it's all very hush hush stuff.
