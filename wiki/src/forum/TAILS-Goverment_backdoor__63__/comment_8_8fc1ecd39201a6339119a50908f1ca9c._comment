... I consider myself well qualified to comment on concerns that Tails or Tor itself are backdoored by the US government.

I've used Tor for almost all my websurfing for years, and I've encountered considerable harrassment by local government agents, but haven't yet been gitmo'd.  I've learned that Tor has close ties to the EFF, an organization I mostly trust.  I know that Tor originated as a US Naval Research Lab project, and I've seen many posts in forums like this claiming that Tor can be easily subverted by US government spooks at will--- but I've seen what I regard as more credible leaked documents suggesting that the opposite is true.  So on balance, while I remain wary, I mostly trust the Tor developers (including Mike Perry) and I continually hope that further improvements in Tor (and advances in my own abilities to verify that my own Tor installation has not been tampered with) will allay most of my concerns in the future.

I haven't used Tails as much, but the advice offered in the documentation pages accords well with my years of experience and with my own thinking about using Tor, and Tails has improved so much since the first version I tried, that my impression is that Tails is one of the best \"grassroots\" organizations out there trying to help ordinary people access and browse the web safely.  

One important point to bear in mind is that governments (and their mega-corporate masters) often employ disinformation campaigns (which are often surprisingly crude, at the level or paid trolling) seeking to \"dismay and disrupt\" alleged \"adversary organizations\".  Assuming, as I tend to assume, that Tails and Tor are indeed on the side of the ordinary citizen of this troubled world, one should expect occasional attempts by authoritarian forces to sow \"dismay and disruption\" by attempting to initiate and spread conspiracy theories which might tend to dissuade the people who most need Tor/Tails (like human rights activists) from using this software.

The US government is particularly interesting in this regard.  Some observers see evidence of internal conflicts in such anomalies as the US State Department awarding a prize to the very developers which the US Department of Homeland Security is harrassing in retaliation for their work on privacy-enhancing software.  At one point the State Department was sponsoring an item of software which was credibly exposed as suffering from serious flaws, which raised the question of whether the State Department was trying to get people killed (people working for regime change in some of the most repressive countries on Earth).  My guess, given the massive amounts of generally credible leaked documents wailing about the difficulty the US government is experiencing in finding talented worker bees to operate the Surveillance State, is that they probably were not, that the problem of developing reliable privacy-protecting software is simply difficult, and that the particular developer in the criticized item of software (not Tor or Tails!) was simply not up to the task. 

When considering the post 9/11 actions of the U.S. government, it is also important to recognize that many insiders in the NSA and FBI who actually opposed (for good reasons) \"information sharing\" and privacy-destroying surveillance of American citizens have mostly been eased out the door, and an entirely new generation with very different (and much more authoritarian) attitudes brought in.  I hope that more of the people who were ushered out the door will come forward to tell their stories.  It would really help if someone like Domscheit-Berg open-sourced the OpenLeaks/Wikileaks software, so that organizations like Tails can possibly expand into putting up leak sites.
