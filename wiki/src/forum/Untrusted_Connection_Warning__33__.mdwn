Sometimes when i browse via Tails some websites, they show the following message/screen of warning, and I want to know if it is completely safe to visit such websites anonymously via TAILS:

********************************************
You have asked to connect
securely to www.xxxxxx.com, but we can't confirm that your connection is secure.
          Normally, when you try to connect securely,
sites will present trusted identification to prove that you are
going to the right place. However, this site's identity can't be verified.
            
        
          What Should I Do?
          
            If you usually connect to
this site without problems, this error could mean that someone is
trying to impersonate the site, and you shouldn't continue.

www.xxxxxx.com uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided.

(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)
  
       
        I Understand the Risks
          
            If you understand what's going on, you
can tell the browser to start trusting this site's identification.
Even if you trust the site, this error could mean that someone is
tampering with your connection.
            Don't add an exception unless
you know there's a good reason why this site doesn't use trusted identification.
