Is there some mechanism by which someone can anonymously contribute (maybe by simply posting a thread?) a tutorial on using GPG from the command line (i.e. in a Linux shell) for those who prefer the precision and flexiblity of the shell, and/or the possibly mindless copy-pastability of such instructions?
