A a page of commands useful in tails could be handy for the newbies. Key import/generation, iso verification, etc, seem to crop up quite often. You could search the forum for some terms like \"command\" and \"terminal\" if you're tempted and want some inspiration.

Also check the docs: there are some useful titbits sprinkled around.

Don't forget to KISS ;)
