No, sorry.

Please don't: this is not practical, lands onto a private mailing-list, has no public archive => leads to closed down development, which is a dead-end for a project like Tails.

Email is the primary communication way between Tails contributors. I suggest creating yourself, using Tails, an email account dedicated to contributing to Tails, and welcome on tails-dev mailing-list :)
