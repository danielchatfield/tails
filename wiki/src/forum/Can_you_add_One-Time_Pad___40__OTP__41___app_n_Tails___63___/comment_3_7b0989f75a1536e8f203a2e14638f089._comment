Nice! I hope this gets suported by default :)

Here is a crazy idea though: Could this be used to simultaneously encript and stenografically hide the persistent volume, the whole tails volume or even both?

Imagine that one uses morse code or something to convert bits (0 and 1s/ dots and slahes) into leters.Then one could use a one-time-pad tool to encrypt the persistent volume in an unbreakable way. One would then use a second pen, filled with random data or with just enough random \"free space\" random data and a few musics to make it inconspicous, to decrypt persistence from the greeter.

Alternatively, if one had a generic usb bootloader, GRUB or GRUB-like and modyfied it to at boot time check for other usbs, run morse to convert its bits to the pseudo-randomly generated text and then aply it to decrypt and run tails. If no extra pen with the correct pad were present at boot time (and one migth instruct GRUB to decrypt only a tiny bit of the pad to check its the correct one for exemple decrypting the \"amnesia\" word so that in the case it is not the boot does not stall too much atracting atention) it would then load something neutral like the Knoppix.

Of course this migth be a completelly unfeasable idea and even if correct it migth have some pitfalls, but I had it on my head for a while and with someone sugesting using OTP encryption in tails I just couldn't resist sharing it :)

Cheers, hypothesys
