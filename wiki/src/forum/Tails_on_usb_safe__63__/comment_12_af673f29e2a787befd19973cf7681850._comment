When USB thumbdrives were new, many of them had a write protect switch. Unfortunately, today there are only a few such products on the market, and it's unclear if they can be trusted, Maybe they are totally worthless like the write protection in SD cards.

Write-once optical media is  safer, but not very convenient, and the drives are going away from portable computers.
