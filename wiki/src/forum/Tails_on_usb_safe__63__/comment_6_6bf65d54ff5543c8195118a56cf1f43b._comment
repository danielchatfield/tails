I am the writer of comment 4 but not of comment 3.

I apologize if my statements made in comment 4 sound harsh but please do not take them as personal attacks on the integrity of the Tails' team.

>Iceweasel has a remote arbitrary code execution hole

>a local priviledge excalation hole is available

>the malware is specifically targeted at Tails

It isn't difficult for the above three conditions to occur simultaneously or is it?
