> If you surf to a website and it contains malware, that malware can cross over to your USB stick and infect it.

I feel it's critical, when writing such bold and strong
statements, to clarify exactly what are the preconditions for
this to be true, that is:

1. Iceweasel has a remote arbitrary code execution hole
2. a local priviledge excalation hole is available
3. the malware is specifically targeted at Tails

The three have to occur at the same time. If you've found an
easier way to persistently infect a Tails USB stick, please
speak up.
