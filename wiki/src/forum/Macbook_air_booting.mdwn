Hi,

Wondering if anyone can help. I'm trying to boot tails from my macbook air. Since I don't want to use my external dvd drive I copied over the iso to my zalman ve200 (basically a usb hard drive but supports hardware cd/dvd virtualization). It starts to boot then comes up with an error message of unknown user. Any ideas? I'm running an Intel based 2011 macbook air.

Thanks.
