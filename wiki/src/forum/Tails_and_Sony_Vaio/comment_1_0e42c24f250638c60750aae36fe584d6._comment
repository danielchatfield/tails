BIOS is set to boot from external media as first choice then hard disk then network. Those are the only available options.

I have tried almost every USB boot creator under the sun from Unetbootin and all the likes.

I also tried to format USB to FAT, FAT32, NTFS. Only in FAT does the laptop boot to reach the Tails boot screen or any other linux based that I tried and then it freezes. Otherwise (FAT32 or NTFS) it fails to boot from USB entirely.
