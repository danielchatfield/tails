I have entered *windows* on the search box at the upper right corner of any pages on Tails website. First hit: [[todo/windows_theme]]. Read the table of content, click \"Windows XP\", links to the theme are right there.

(Tails is free software. Its development is done publicly through this wiki. Please search and read better before asking.)
