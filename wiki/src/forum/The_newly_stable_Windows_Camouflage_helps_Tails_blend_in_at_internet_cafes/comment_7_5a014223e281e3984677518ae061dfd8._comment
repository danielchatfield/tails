>Tails documentation on desktop

I don't see that.
----------

Some observations about the Windows Camo.:

1.) No \"Show Desktop\" button in taskbar.

2.) In the taskbar, the \"Unsafe Browser\" windows appear identical to regular Tor-enabled Iceweasel. 

Is there any way of changing this without defeating the camoflouge?

How commonly do Internet cafes and the like have another browser such as Firefox, Chrome or Opera installed on the terminals?

If that is not so rare, then perhaps the unsafe browser could be themed as one of those non-IE browsers.

3.) The only shutdown button I could find is in Start > System > Administration

This is a double-edged sword: On one hand, this is not quickly found and could be a real problem in a panic.

On the other hand, the problem of being too easy to accidentally shutdown that the regular TAILS theme has is avoided. Seems like the other extreme, actually. 

Surely there is no reason for there not to be a happy medium; an easy-to-find, intuitive button for immediatedly shutting down TAILS but one that is not so easy to hit mistakenly. (i.e., not in such an awkward position as right above the close-window X)
