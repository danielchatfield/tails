I was thinking about this the other day. In effect, how to \"commandeer\" a public computer via security tools without significant arousal of suspicion. --In effect-- the USB is the \"portable brain\" of one's digital life --the computer merely the body of it.

Has anyone had experience using The Tor Browser Bundle off USB on Public Machines?

Or TAILS in the same setting?
