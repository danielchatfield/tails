Suppose I have a hard disk drive that is solely used for when I wish to remain anonymous on the Internet. I installed Windows OS on it with minimal features enabled.

The only applications that I installed are the following:

- latest version of Tor Browser Bundle
- disk drive imaging software

Before launching Tor Browser Bundle and surfing the web, I cloned the disk drive and saved the image on to a USB drive.

After having done the above, I surfed the web using Tor Browser Bundle.

When I am done surfing the web, I shut down the computer.

The next time I wish to surf the web anonymously, I will first delete/format the hard disk drive partion and clone the image that I saved on a USB drive to a fresh partition.

What do you guys think? Does my method provide the same anonymity and privacy as using Tails?
