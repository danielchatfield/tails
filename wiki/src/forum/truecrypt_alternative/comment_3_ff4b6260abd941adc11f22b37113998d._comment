The only reference about RealCrypt that I have been able to find was on Mandriva's and not Red Hat: <http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/RealCrypt>

From what I can see, there is no community involved in its development. So every problems with TrueCrypt remains: with a closed development process, trust is hard to earn.
