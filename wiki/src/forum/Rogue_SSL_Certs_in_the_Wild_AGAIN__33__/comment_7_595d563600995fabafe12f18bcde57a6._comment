It's worth noting that the problem here isn't a problem with Tails, or any CA Auth... The problem is simply that **the whole SSL/CA system is stupid by design**

While Tails, Mozilla, Google, Opera, etc must (of course) jump to close all these little \"accidents\" ***as soon as they are disclosed*** it's the whole concept that's woefully naïve and unfit for purpose... and this remains the case even ***between*** débâcles.

Beware
