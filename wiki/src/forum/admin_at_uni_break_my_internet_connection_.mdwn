Hi, I use linux to boot PC at university (they use xbuntu) but when I use Tor/Tails admin of uni abolish my internet connection. it is the same when I use ".to" domain instead of onion. is there any way to stop him to do it? is there any disabling of remote control in Tails or anything similar? I suppose he must fin Mac address and then use remote control to snitch me and to abolish my connection. I changed Mac with terminal but if I do it in Edit Connections, I loose connection, so, it is not possible to change MAC totally. but maybe there is some way to fuck admin.
