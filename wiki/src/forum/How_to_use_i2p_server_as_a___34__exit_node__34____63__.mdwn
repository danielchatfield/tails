Hello! 
Today everybody knows that traffic runing between exit node and website can be intecepted and used without your permission, for example, by server's owner. As I understand, i2p has it's own exit servers for using global web. If they really belong to i2p they could be more secure. Thats why I'm asking: does anybody know how to configure tails(or browser only) to use i2p through tor(or i2p only) for ALL connections, I mean not only for i2p sites? I guess foxyproxy could be configured to do that, but I have no experience of using it? Yes, it will make internet connection slow like in 1995 :)) but more secure as well. Any opinion?
