There are various standard Unix ways to start a \"new\" GNOME session. However, as currently implemented, Tails does absolutely *not* guarantee that this \"new\" session will be equivalent to a fresh start. So, there's currently little point in logging off. A fancy idea someone had at some point was to have a \"quick restart\" feature, based on kexec, that could even reuse the current session's settings (persistence, etc.).
