when a topic is answered, the answer do not shows on top of topics wich makes it uneasy to find. 

Also, even if i am conscious of the work it involves, i want to suggest that a different forum organisation could be benefic : for instance, a sub forum for installation topics, an other one for the hardware stuf, an other one for the security advices/requests, an other one for the wifi/network connecting stuff, an other one for virtualisation, an other one for devs, an other one for suggestions/requests, an other one for general talk, etc etc.

thanks for attention
