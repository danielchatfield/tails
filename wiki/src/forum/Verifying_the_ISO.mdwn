I am using windows and gpgwin. Do I need to create a key pair in order to do the verification process? I did the direct download and downloaded the ISO and the ISO pgp and the key and inserted all that into Kleopatra and it is giving me the message "not enough information to check signiture validity". What am I doing wrong? I imported the signing key and then put the sig into the input file and I put the iso download into the signed data. Is this correct? Thanks in advance.
