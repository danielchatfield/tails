> How much safer is aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 encryption compared to the TrueCrypt encrypted volume? 

This is mostly irrelevant given that breaking either of them will cost too much (on the scale of \"convert all matter in our solar system into a super copmuter and assume we have infinite energy, and cracking AES-256 will still take billions of years\"). A real world attacker will instead try to crack your password, which most likely doesn't utilize the full potential of AES-256 (or even half of it). For reference, such a password would require something like 40 characters that are **randomly** selected from the 95 printable ASCII characters found on a standard keyboard.
