Format the USB drive as Fat 32 using Disk Utility make sure the boot partition is set to GUID in options. Then either follow the manual installation instructions here:

Tails or liberte ISO instructions should be the same.

If that fails you could try downloading Unetbootin for OSX. (Has a much friendlier GUI).

Anyone have any info regarding the original issue yet? Any success booting a live CD in latest Mac models or 10.7.3?
