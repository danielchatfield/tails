Amazing! My other question is you mentioned in your instruction the program is not a bootloader. So I will still need to use rEFIt in conjunction with your program? Furthermore, it seems you've provided a patched version of rEFIt? Should I install your patched rEFIt, then your boot organizer?

Again, I'm VERY new to boot loading and tinkering with EFI on the mac.
Thanks, and I appreciate the support and patience.
