10.5.8 should not be a problem for rEFIt.

However some people are experiencing problems with the rEFIt blesser.

Try removing rEFItBlesser in /libary/Startup Items/
Restart computer or shut down and open
Open Terminal
type:

cd /efi/refit

./enable.sh

You shouldn't have to hold alt down for refit. Just restart the computer a few times and it should show.

Hope that helps.
