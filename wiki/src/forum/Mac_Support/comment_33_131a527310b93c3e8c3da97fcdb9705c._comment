Hello everybody.

I tried the [instructions for using rEFIt and Unetbootin in the above post](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Mac_Support/#comment-b9e89d788ee92f3f9be4d5d7916fab84), and got close but failed at the last hurdle. Hopefully someone here can shed some light.

I'm using an Intel MacBookPro3,1 (late 2007 model). TAILS was installed using Unetbootin on a FAT-32-formatted USB pen on a GUID partition table. Crucially, at the end of the Unetbootin process, it displayed this message:

>The created USB device will not boot off a Mac. Insert it into a PC, and select the USB boot option in the BIOS menu.

First I tried installing rEFIt on a second USB stick, and secondly I tried installing it on the internal HD. Both methods got the same result.

REFIt appeared on restart and the TAILS volume was represented by a Linux icon. When I chose it as the startup volume this Linux icon would sit in the middle of the screen for a while, like the gray Apple during a normal startup, before the screen would turn black and the following would appear:

    Starting legacy loader
    Using load options 'USB'
    Error: Not Found returned from legacy loader
    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath
    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath
    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath
    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath
    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath

    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath
    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath
    Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath
    Error: Load Error while (re)opening our installation volume
    
    The firmware refused to boot from the selected volume. Note that external
    hard drives are not well-supported by Apple's firmware for legacy OS booting.

Since other people seem to have got it working using this method, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Does anyone have any advice?
