I successfully created my bootable USB drive via the Tails Live DVD's utility, but my MacBook running Lion 10.7.4 does not recognize the drive upon startup while holding down the Option key. I know it's not a problem with my laptop because I'm able to boot into a cloned external hard drive. Also, I doubt it's a problem with my flash drive because it's brand new.

Is anyone else having this issue? If so, could anyone offer any advice? I may try the steps outlined in the \"Mac OS X Unetbootin Guide\" post and report back...

Thanks!
