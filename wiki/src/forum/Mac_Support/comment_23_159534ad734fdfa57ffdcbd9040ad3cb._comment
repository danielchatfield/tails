... Doesn't work. 

Tried the method posted earlier. I get the rEFIt boot loader. Doesn't see the TAILS USB stick. 

Once again this seems to be a LATE 2011 Macbook issue rather than a 10.7.3 issue (Which makes sense since OSX shouldn't really have a say in the matter).

For the guy with the 10.5.8 problems. You should try rEFInd. See if that helps you.
Follow the instruction here: 
http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html

If read and followed properly they are very thorough.

Again whether TAILS will boot on your machine will depend on your hardware rather than software. So if you boot into OSX and click on the apple icon > About This Mac > More Info; you should see the make and model (with a date reference) e.g. Macbook Pro. 13-inch, Late 2011.

When searching for a solution it may be better if you look for threads relating to your hardware configuration rather than software.
