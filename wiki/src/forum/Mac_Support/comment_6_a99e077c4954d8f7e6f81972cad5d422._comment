Yes its complete rubbish. We need more mac support in terms of booting Tails on USB. If anyone knows a method using 10.5.8, I'd be VERY delighted to listen. rEFIt seems to \"boot\" it for me, but again, I always get stuck on the command line screen with the blinking underscore.

Please, any help would be very appreciated. I want to maintain the cross-platform versatility on the USB key method (as well as encrypted data benefits).
