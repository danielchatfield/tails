The steps you should take in order to run Tails from USB are actually quite easy.

At first I downloaded rEFIt and manually installed it on a USB memory stick. I've taken the following instructions of the rEFIt website and adjusted them a little bit to match the process I went through.

\"Download the “Mac disk image” or any of the other two binary distributions from the home page. Double-click to mount or unpack them.
Copy the “efi” folder from the rEFIt distribution to the root level of the USB memory stick.
Open Terminal and enter the following commands:
cd /Volumes/MyStick/efi/refit
./enable.sh
When prompted, enter the password for your user account.

The path in Terminal will be different, for example “/Volumes/MyStick/efi/refit” if the volume is named “MyStick”. Also make sure the volume is formatted in the Mac OS Extended format.\"

rEFIt is now ready to make Tails boot, so next we go prepare the USB memory stick for Tails itself. Go to Utilities and then launch Disk Utility. Select the right drive and click the Partition tab. Select 1 Partition as Volume Scheme, hit Options to verify if GUID is selected and finally select FAT as Format. Click Apply and you're ready for the next step.

The last step is very simple. Open Unetbootin, select the Tails ISO file under Diskimage, choose USB Drive as Type and then click the right volume under Drive. Press OK and the installation will start.

After this process has been completed turn off your Mac. Make sure both the USB memory sticks are attached and boot your Mac again. Press and hold the option key once the gray screen shows up until rEFIt starts. Choose the Unetbootin drive and perform the regular actions in order to boot Tails.

This was tested on a Mid 2011 MacBook Air with Mac OS X 10.7.3 installed.
