I just followed the above Mac installation instructions precisely on an Early 2013 Macbook Pro 13\" Retina running 10.8.3.  I was able to boot into Tails successfully, but I'm experiencing the terrible screen distortion mentioned in comment posted Tue 01 May 2012 10:18:29 PM CEST. 

I tried following the link to here: 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-nouveau/+bug/898784

However, I'm a relative n00b when it comes to Linux and I wasn't clear if there were negative consequences of upgrading the Ubuntu kernel in Tails (is there anything fundamentally different about the kernel itself in Tails? Will it still run, and run securely if I upgrade the kernel?)

So at the moment, it's basically unusable.  However, I can report that the above Mac installation instructions do work at least to get a bootable live USB installation of Tails operating on a newer Macbook Pro.
