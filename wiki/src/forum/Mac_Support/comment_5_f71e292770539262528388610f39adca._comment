It's unlikely to be a tails issue. Or at least a tails issue alone. I can't boot any Linux live USB on the latest Macbook Hardware.

The developers of refit abandoned it a few years back now. A fork of refit has been continued under the name rEFINd however I can confirm this method will not work either.

I'm going to try and use BOOTCAMP to create a windows partition. Then use Wubi installer to see if I can get Ubuntu on there. After that I'll see if there's a way I can get grub loader to boot a live USB.

Oh the joys of Macintosh.
