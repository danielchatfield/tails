Oh man, thanks for the info on what do to on 10.5.8. I did that and now EDI mode works (and I can choose to boot tails). Problem is now when I go to boot tails it just stays on the black command prompt screen, just showing a blinking underscore. It doesn't do anything else. I've left it for 20 minutes and nothing happened. 

I used the Tails USB installer off the Tails DVD (I have working), so I don't understand why it won't boot up. Any ideas?
