I followed the above 'Mac OS X Unetbootin guide' but I installed rEFIT to my Air's solid state internal. I followed the other steps to the 'T' to a newly formatted USB using the steps outlined to format it in Disk Utilities. I then installed Tails to the USB using Unetbootin.

With the USB attached, I boot my Air and rEFIT shows without pressing any keys. I can either boot OSX from my internal or boot Linux from the USB. The Linux option says, 'Boot Linux from USB', complete with a Linux penguin.

Prior to Linux loading, I get a Unetbootin screen, which goes away, followed by the normal Linux loading screen (status bar at the bottom of the screen).

Then the Linux desktop loads. It was all quite easy.
