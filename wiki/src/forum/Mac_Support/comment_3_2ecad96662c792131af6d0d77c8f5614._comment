I can confirm the issue described in the first comment on Mac OS X 10.7.3. rEFIt starts as supposed, but it doesn't recognize Tails on the USB-drive. I've followed the manual installation process carefully. I've formatted the drive with various file systems and after ten attempts I concluded it must be some kind of bug as the previous version of Tails worked just fine.

The Partition Inspector of rEFIt returns the following feedback:

Partition at LBA 409640:
 Boot Code: None
 File System: Unknown
 Listed in GPT as partition 2, type Unknown
