Hey, I found something in an other forum, but I don' understand it realy. This man said, it works. Maybe the Tails-Team can use it to make tails working on a mac propperly?


\"It works!  Can now boot Linux on an unmodified MacBook Pro (5,2) from a single USB stick (or external hard drive).  I created a small 25MB partition as the first partition, formated it as Mac OS X Journaled and installed rEFIt to it, then followed that partition with a 100 MB boot partition, and then a root partition on a thumb drive (if using an external hard drive you could create swap as well, but I don’t do that on thumb drives so they don’t get worn out).  Install linux normally (debootstrap is how I do it) onto the second and third partitions.  Make sure Grub is installed to the MBR of the drive and points to the /boot partition as the second partition.  Then take the USB drive to a MacBook Pro and insert it.  Turn on the MBP and hold down the Alt/Option key until you see a boot menu offering Mac OS X or rEFIt.  Choose rEFIt.  After that you’ll be give a menu to choose OS X again or Linux.  Here, choose Linux.  Tada, now comes the Grub boot screen and then on into the Linux of your choice.  Congrats and enjoy…\"
