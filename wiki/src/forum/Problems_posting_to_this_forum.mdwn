So this probably won't work either.

Preview works but when I hit "post" I see

     Error: /var/www/boum.org/amnesia/todo/about_Tails_launcher/index.html independently created, not overwriting with version from todo/about_Tails_launcher 

which appears to refer to

     https://tails.boum.org/todo/about_Tails_launcher/

(not an item I have anything to do with)

Using Tails 0.16 (while trying to figure out FF 17 ESR issue)
