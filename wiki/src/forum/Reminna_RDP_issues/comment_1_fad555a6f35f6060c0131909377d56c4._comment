Are you sure that Reminna will go through a Tor circuit?

Maybe a naive suggestion, but if not, could the personal firewall on your Tor system be blocking it?

(In other threads here, \"Tails\" confirmed that a Tails system does have a personal firewall, and in fact that is one way in which Tails tries to block untorified clients from destroying your anonymity while using Tails.)
