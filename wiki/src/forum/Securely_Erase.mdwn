The system has a Secure Erase feature that can be accessed by a mouse right click. This is very handy as I have never seen such a simple solution in any other Linux Distro or LiveCD. Does anyone no what function or overwrite it uses to say the file is Securely erased?

Does anyone know how to get hold of the Secure Erase package, so I can look at it's code and function?
