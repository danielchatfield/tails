Ok forget about the free vpn thing, I was thinking in which situations they can be good but now I see it's illogical.

So there's no difference between those two cases. I just need the VPN support to add an extra protection by using \"Bitcoin accepted\" and \"non-logging\" VPN providers.

But when using a public computer or public connection there's the need for macchanger. So the title should be \"I need VPN + macchanger\" :)

Is it clear now?
