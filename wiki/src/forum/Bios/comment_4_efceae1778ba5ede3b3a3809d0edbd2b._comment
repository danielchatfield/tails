God...this is bad...

Is anything beeing done about this?!

Is the European Parliament being notified of this?! We killed ACTA, now they come after the hardware....but maybe?! We can do it again?!

What about Coreboot? How is it an option? Tecnical ways to circunvent this? All avenues should be simultaneously employed to stop this thing!!!
