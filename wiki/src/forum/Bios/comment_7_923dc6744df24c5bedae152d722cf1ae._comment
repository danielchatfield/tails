You obviously haven't researched W8 very well.  It will of course be shipped on just about every new computer on sale from October 26 ansd dealers will not offer or be able to offer new computers with a previous OS.  This is normal Microsoft procedure, and any dealer offering or selling boxes with W7 or earlier are liable to lose their license to sell MS machines.

Windows 8 hardware will come with the Secure Boot technology enabled in the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), meaning that only operating systems with an appropriate digital signature will be able to boot.

So what of Tails?  Is the next version being prepared to deal with this?
