Dear Tails devs

I see these comments on forums lately. Any of this true?
Also wouldn't a generic Tor Browser Bundle installation also pick random entry guards? I don't see the problem here:

Until Amnesia has persistent entry guards I would steer clear of it. Liberte has some shit design choices, their cables private messaging system being one example. They have a lot of advantages over tails as well though, tails lack of persistent entry guards is a huge hit to it and even if you load it from a snapshot it only partially fixes the issues. If you must use a live CD just keep in mind that if you use Amnesia you are going to be significantly degrading the anonymity provided by Tor, particularly if you don't load from a snapshot.

The thing that sucks about amnesia and other live Tor CD's is the fact that entry guards do not stay persistent between reboots. This leads to entry guards rotating much faster than they should and puts you at high risk of profiling attacks (end to end).

You should run it in a virtual machine and load it from a snapshot. If you use it as a traditional live CD, booting from it each session, you will greatly increase your risk to profiling attacks until they make the entry guards Tor selects persistent somehow. You really need to make sure to load it from a snapshot, its a huge risk to the anonymity of Tor to select new entry guards that quickly.
