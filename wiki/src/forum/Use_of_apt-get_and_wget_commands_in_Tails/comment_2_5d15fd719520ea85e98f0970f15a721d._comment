If you searched the forum, you would have come across a post in which Tails stated in no uncertain terms that installing third party software or uninstalling software that Tails provides does not qualify for support here.

Unless you are very sure what the third party software does and how it functions, it would be best to avoid installing them. There is a very strong possibility they would break the anonymity that Tails affords.
