0.15 boot error mesg: "Failed to Connect To The Virtualbox Kernel Service" and it repeats itself three or four times.

I disabled all virtualization in my BIOS, unless I'm using a distro which requires this option reset to Enabled. I was unaware 0.15 would use/need virtualization enabled.

The message repeats within ~/.xsession-errors as:

*Failed to connect to the VirtualBox kernel service*

I don't understand the error message, could someone elaborate please?
