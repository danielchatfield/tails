Own project? Uhm, why a new one? :P Tails is great! 
the thing is that many, for what I've seen in this
forum, want some kind of: 

   tor (the default one)
   tor -> vpn 
   vpn -> tor
   vpn
   plain connection -> internet

Of the annonymous distros, this one is the finest,
yet, if anyone wants to do online banking and stuff
like that that these days are making so famous the
linux usb live distros, when they find out certain
things, its not irrational to think about a vpn at
the end... or at the beginning, since its not always
possibly to use tor in most networks!
