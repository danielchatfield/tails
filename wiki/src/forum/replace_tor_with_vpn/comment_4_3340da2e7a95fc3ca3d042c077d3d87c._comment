>if anyone wants to do online banking and stuff like that that these days are making so famous the linux usb live distros,

What is that supposed to mean? I use Tor to conduct online banking. I find it works very well. Of course I'm careful to ensure the connection is made over SSL with the institutions genuine certificate - just as I would be using any other untrusted connection. (NB **All** internet connections are inherently untrusted)

>when they find out certain things,

When who finds out what \"certain\" things? Exactly?

>its not irrational to think about a vpn at the end...

Yes it is. Utterly self-defeating: Therefore \"irrational\" is *exactly* what it is.
