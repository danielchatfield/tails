>Of the annonymous distros, this one is the finest, yet, if anyone wants to do online banking and stuff like that that these days are making so famous the linux usb live distros, when they find out certain things, its not irrational to think about a vpn at the end... or at the beginning, since its not always possibly to use tor in most networks!

I'm not quite sure you fully understand what you're saying. Allow me to paraphrase it for you:

\"Tails is a great distro but some sites (like facebook) block anonymous traffic. All the Tails users' traffic which has been *so carefully* routed *in its entirety* onto the comparatively heigh latency, low bandwidth, somewhat unreliable *anonymising* Tor network should then be de-anonymised so I can use facebook. Tails as a live distro with a high latency, low bandwidth, unreliable, non anonymous network connection would be even betterer than wot Tailz is now cuz itz c001 2 fb00k.\"
