I hope someone noob friendly would give me step by step guidance on how to install madwifi package on tails.

Package found here: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/madwifi/madwifi-0.9.4.tar.gz

I tried to follow the instructions given within the package for installation, but got an error when excuting "make" command:


root@amnesia:/home/amnesia/Desktop/madwifi-0.9.4# make
cd: 1: can't cd to /lib/modules/3.2.0-4-686-pae/build
Makefile.inc:66: *** /lib/modules/3.2.0-4-686-pae/build is missing, please set KERNELPATH.  Stop.
