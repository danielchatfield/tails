I have the same problem... unless I boot into VirtualBox I've only gotten internet ONCE on my liveCD... couldnt replicate that connection no matter what settings ive tried.

I even made 3 different networks, one guest network(ssid broadcast) w/ a wep, one main network (SSID broadcast, wpa2personal), and a hidden network w/ a WEP. none of the 3 would connect, no matter how many settings i tinkered with.
