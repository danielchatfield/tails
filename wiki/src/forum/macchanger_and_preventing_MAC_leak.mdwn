There seems still uncertainty on part of the Tails developers whether MAC address needs to be faked at boot time thus preventing leak of the real MAC. Since Tails is an anonymity/security-oriented distro , the answer is ABSOLUTELY YES , especially the wireless MAC. If there is a need for the real MAC it can be easily changed after boot, or even a selection menu be provided for the user to decide whether to proceed with the real MAC or change it before it's broadcast by the Wi-Fi radio.
