I had some suggestions for you:

Now in Tails, DuckDuckGo comes as default in Iceweasel and you've also added DuckDuckGo (SSL). But since we use HTTPS Everywhere these two search plugins works the same.

I recommend you to delete them both but add these two search plugins:

<https://dl.dropbox.com/u/57167529/searchplugins.zip>

1. DuckDuckGo (Onion): http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/html/
2. DuckDuckGo (SSL): https://www.duckduckgo.com/html/

The hidden service (onion) will be much more secure than the other. Both of them are the non-JS version of DuckDuckGo (/html/) so works when javascript is disabled (default won't). Different from default, they're using method=\"POST\" and there are no queries shown in the url which is better for privacy.

So what do you think?
