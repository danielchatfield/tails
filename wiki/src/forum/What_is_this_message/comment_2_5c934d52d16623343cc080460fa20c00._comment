I don't see anything which indicates that some Tails bug caused these problems.

Tor can be hard to get going for many reasons (the persistent problem with non-persistence having implications for Tor Entry guards may make things worse, but it can be hard to get Tor circuits running smoothly even if you have persistence between Tor sessions).

Don't forget that as more people use Tor the existing network is increasingly strained.  The answer is more Tor nodes.
