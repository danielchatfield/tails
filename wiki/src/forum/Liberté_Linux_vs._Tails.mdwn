How well does Libert√© Linux compare with Tails?

Distrowatch says the Origin is Undisclosed, which is similar to Tails developers in remaining anonymous, am I correct?

It appears rather new, compared with Tails which has been around awhile and built off a previous incarnation.

What are the main strengths and weaknesses of each distro?
