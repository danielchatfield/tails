The squashfs in Tails 0.8 uses XZ compression which requires Linux kernel >= 2.6.38 and squashfs-tools >= 4.2. These are available in Ubuntu Natty (11.04).

Editing the squashfs should work although you of course also have to generate an iso and install a boot loader. However, we don't support such modifications, so you are on your own from now on.
