I don't know if you Tails devs were gamers when you were younger (or now), but in the old days of the Nintendo Entertainment System in the 80's, many games were without any kind of built in memory, and actually used a code system. 

This little code that you had to write down or remember would act as a way to save many of the upgrades and progress you had made since starting your game. 

In this way, when you turn off your system, and came back another time, you just entered the code, and you are back to the same level in the game and your character is back with all his, or her (Samus, thinking of you!) upgrades and status.

In the same way as this, I know it may not be trivial, but Tails could also use a little code to keep a little bit of persistant info, without being a full persistence system. It would be a sort of midway compromise. And I bet other uses could be found, besides just making entry guards possible (and those are already a pretty important thing, they do help).

If the N.E.S in the 80's could do it, surely Tails could, too, could it not?
