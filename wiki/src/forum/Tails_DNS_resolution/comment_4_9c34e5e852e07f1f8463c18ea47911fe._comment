> This way all DNS requests is made through Tor (using Tor's own way of doing DNS requests).

Correction: The DNS requests is not made using Tor's own way of doing them. Instead they are apparently done by contacting a OpenDNS server using a TCP version of the DNS protocol, all of course through Tor.

See the file \"/etc/ttdnsd.conf\" and the command \"man ttdnsd\" for more details.
