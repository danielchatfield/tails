hi !

i was very happy to success installing t(a)ils 0.6.2 on a (fat32 boohoohoo)
usb key with unetbootin* (did'nt tried fusbi yet) and wonder how to keep settings
from one session to other : is the "cow" directory a recommended location ? how does it works ?

by the way how to boot directly with my langage settings without having to select in a boot menu ?)

thanks again to this excellent debian distribution...

hope to read more about that...

(*) :
started unetbootin from within a debian box (ask for root)
choosed "debian" and "iso -> paath-to-tails-iso
installed to key and restarted

only thing i dislike : unetbootin do not work with ext2

-------------------------

somewhere on these pages was a suggestion to : 
cat 'path-to-tails-iso' > /dev/sdx (usb key), && sync

this works not for me and i had to reformat the key that was tottaly messed up

-----------------------------------------
