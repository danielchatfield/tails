Nothing to prevent you pasting in a socks5 proxy into FoxyProxy to use on top of Tor so you're not connecting with an Exit node that was previously banned. 

You can buy socks5 proxies that are unused for $0.30/ea or make your own by renting VPS or dirt cheap shell account, use ssh to open up a socks5 and connect to it by putting the IP into foxyproxy
