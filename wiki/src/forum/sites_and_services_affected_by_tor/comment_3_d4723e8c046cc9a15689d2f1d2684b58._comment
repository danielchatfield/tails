This is a problem with any anonymizing service.  To connect to regular web content, you will always need to have an exit address from the anonymized service.

Any additional anonymizing services, like proxies, that you add to your connection chain will always suffer from this same problem.

The required solution is a paradigm shift by the hosts that blacklist anonymizing exit addresses.  I imagine that the growing size of blacklists will eventually become impractical and the hosts will have to switch to some form of whitelists, or they will have to accept the uncertainty of identity on the web.

The temporary solution is to continuously discover new anonymizing services that you can append to your connection chain before everyone else tarnishes them.
