Perhards there could be some documentation on sites that experience usability issues when using tor on the tails or tor website. New users wouldn't have to wonder what sites will and will not work. If they are looking for alternatives for services (email providers, online backup, etc.), they could check if that service is listed as \"limited usuablity\" or something like that so they don't have to waste anymore time than they have to.
