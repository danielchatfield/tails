why is my desktop being shown as in laptop mode when I shutdown? there's also some myserious "SENSE" or "sense" data shown, much like would be shown within a binary. The shutdown screen quits after wiping so I don't have a chance to catch the information to write it down unless I take a photograph of the screen with a camera. What is this info and why is my desktop being put into laptop mode?

Please answer the other questions here too which are being left to age and fade.
