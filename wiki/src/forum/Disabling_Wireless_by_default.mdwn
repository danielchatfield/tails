Tails 0.12 shows surrounding active wireless networks by default. 

As i hope it spoofs my mac address by default either, I'm more, if not most concerned about my privacy since there are detailed hotspot maps with geolocations all over the globe. Keyword: google streetview, etc...

Even if there is yet no known risk that this info could emerge outside my system, i still don't feel well with giving such sensitive data by default to an "anonymous OS".

Please disable wireless by default.
