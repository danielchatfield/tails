Hello!

I use Tails regularly for few months now. Since Tails 0.12.1 I use always the same USB stick and it worked well on every computer I used before (10+ computers of different types used!).

But on new Toshiba Satellite L830-114 laptop (i3 2377M processor, 4 GB RAM) tails does not boot at all!

The messages are:

Loading, please wait...
[   3.320093] xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Failed to enable MSI-X
[   3.473541] [drm:intel_dsm_platform_mux_info] *ERROR* MUX INFO call failed
(process:255): GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id (0)

After this message, laptop hangs.

It surprised me that the Tails USB does not work on Toshiba laptop. It worked on so many other computers before!

Do you have any suggestions?
