Hi, i starting use tails from usb, i boot the computer and success to get to the Tails Operating system desktop, but when i click on iceweaser and try to start surfing on the net, i get error messages roughly in that order:

-The connection has timed out-

- maybe the tor browser too busy so try again in few minutes
- message about to check my computer connection
- if your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy make sure that iceweaser is permitted to access the web.

also, i always got a message about the clock synchronizing that tor needed especially for hidden services. i trying to re-run the system time sync from the command line, like someone here said, but The command line ask me "password for amnesia" so i can't even re-run it.

The internet in my regular operating system works great. What is the problem?? if there is any problem.
