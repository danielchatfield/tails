I would like to know how to configure VNC to work over TOR. Either from local host to TOR/Tails then to the remote server as the OP described, or just within tails to the server.

In my case it's a linux remote server and I *DO* wish to conceal my identity from the server. At this point I'm just doing it to learn how, but I can imagine this being useful in any number of common situations, such as if I am maintaining a database serving pro-democracy media in North Korea and I don't want to go to a torture camp.
