It is not about concealing my location...

My work place IT admins do not want any portfowarding.......

There are other alternativies like reverse ssh or reverse vnc connections but my home pc needs to be on continously even to if i don't want to connect to my work pc.

The only option left is SSH-VNC over TOR. and I perfer this one.
