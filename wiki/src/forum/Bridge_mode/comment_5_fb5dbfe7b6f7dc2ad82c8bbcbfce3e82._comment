>You should get the IP and port for two bridges and that ought to be enough for a few days.

I disagree. Here's how I do it:

Solve the CAPTCHA and get 2 bridges. Write them down, the IP and the port # to a piece of paper.

In Vidalia, click New Identity, wait for the choice to be made available again, and click New Identity again.

Return to the Tor Bridges page and solve the CAPTCHA, get 2 more bridges, write them to the same sheet of paper.

Repeat the above process until you have 20 or more bridges. Now your session may last longer and may provide better speeds than if you had only chosen 2.

Some bridges are up and down in a day, some last for much longer, several days, weeks, whatever.

If you find fetching 20 bridges requires too much time, 10 should be fine.

When you're done with the paper, throw it into your fireplace or otherwise burn it. Shredder machines aren't safe. Were they so, they would burn or turn to powder the paper.
