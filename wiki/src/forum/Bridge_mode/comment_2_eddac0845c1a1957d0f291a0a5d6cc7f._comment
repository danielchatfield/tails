@ OP:

This post contains the same information in the Tails documentation and in the Vidalia controller \"help\" documentation, but expressed in my own words, which I hope will assist you in enabling Bridge mode.

First you need to get the IP addresses of some bridges.  If you can access torproject.org using your browser, the easiest way is to surf to

bridges.torproject.org

You'll have to fill in a simple CAPTCHA to prove you are not a spam bot.  You should get the IP and port for two bridges and that ought to be enough for a few days.  If they get blocked you can try to revisit to get some new bridges.

Tails and TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) both enable the user to modify their Tor client configuration using the Vidalia controller, which you can access by right clicking on the Green onion icon (while Tor is running) and then pressing \"Settings\", then \"Network\".  Then click the box enabling bridge mode.  Then paste in the IP:port for a bridge and press the plus button.  Repeat with another IP:port for another bridge.

If it works you'll be able to use Tor and if you use iftop (for Debian) or a similar tool for Windows/Mac, you should see that you are connected to one of the bridges you entered.

I have done this with TBB, not with Tails yet, so ask again if you try this and it doesn't seem to work.
