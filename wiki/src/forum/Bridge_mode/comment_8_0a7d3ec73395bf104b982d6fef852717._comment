@ comment 6:

I just tried bridge mode in both 0.14~rc1 and 0.14~rc2, and it works as it should. Have you trued with different Tor bridges? Maybe the ones you use has started to misbehave or have gotten heavily congested lately. If it doesn't seem to be a problem with the bridges, please report a bug to us using Whisperback and make sure to include exact steps (what you see and what you do) for reproducing your problem.
