Hi. 

I was able to build my own tails from git (devel branch - building straight in Debian without vagrant). 

Now I would like to customize it in a way that the greeter is skipped and that the options are set hard-coded to:

* leave english locale
* set keyboard to de
* set password for user amnesia
* run custom script after gui is available (more precisely mounting an encrypted partition and asking for its encryption password).

So far I played around by adding a script in chroot_local-includes/lib/live/config which changes the amnesia password. This worked, but the greeter seems to freeze after clicking Login with 'More Options' = No. Like I said, I would like to skip the greeter anyway.

I would be happy for any hints about how to accomplish that.
