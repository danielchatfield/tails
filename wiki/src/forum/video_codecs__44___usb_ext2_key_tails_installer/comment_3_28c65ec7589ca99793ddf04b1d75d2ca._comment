I don't see any question there, merely remarks about the state of things.

Nice to hear.

> 3/trying to get tails working on ext2 usb flashdrive still does'nt gives a result, is it because of fat32 lba type used in the isohybrid command ?

We do not support custom modes of installation, sorry.

> it would be nice if a tails dev could clarify this point : ext2 keys offer one more security level : on wxp the key is appearing as \"unformated\"...

FYI, we tried to make it so the Tails system partition is *not shown* in Windows, so that people don't format it by mistake.
