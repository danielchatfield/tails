hi
may be not that interresting but :

1/strangely no answers to the op questions
2/0.12 shows a \"normal behaviour ie reads every thing afaik

3/trying to get tails working on ext2 usb flashdrive still does'nt gives
a result, is it because of fat32 lba type used in the isohybrid command ?
it would be nice if a tails dev could clarify this point : ext2 keys offer
one more security level : on wxp the key is appearing as \"unformated\"...
