Yes.

I'm not sure what contribution you're talking of, and what you mean by \"contributing\".

> Can I suggest adding [...] to the \"About\" page in the Tails website?

Our finances page is here so that we can point conspiranoids to
it, but last time we discussed it, we saw little interest in
displaying it elsewhere than on the
[[contribute/how/donate]] page.

> I couldn't find that page earlier today

FWIW, it's the first hit when I search for \"finances\" on our website.

This is the entire list of our funders for 2012.
