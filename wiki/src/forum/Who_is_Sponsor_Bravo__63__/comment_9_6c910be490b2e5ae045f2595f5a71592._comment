This forum is about Tails. I'm sorry it's not the appropriate place to have the discussion you apparently want to have. So, please do stop hijacking this forum to discuss USA's foreign policy matters in thousands of words, using a paragraph or three that's really related to Tails as a starting point. This is what I call diverging from the topic.
