Thank you for replying instead of deleting.

Do I now understand correctly the current sponsorship?

* Sponsor Bravo is only a *potential* sponsor, and its identity won't be disclosed unless they provide some cash
* The existence of Sponsor Alfa is undisclosed
* Tor Project, Inc. is one sponsor
* \"NDI\" is a second sponsor

Is this \"NDI\"?

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Institute_for_International_Affairs

From the reaction to some of my contributions here of late, I am prepared to learn that Sponsor Bravo is a \"known hostile\", such as Team Themis or DARPA or In-Q-Tel or Northrop Grumman, so I hope that I will be pleasantly surprised to learn that it is Sonic.net, or some other \"known friendly\"!

Can I suggest adding 

     https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/finances/index.en.html

to the \"About\" page in the Tails website?  I couldn't find that page earlier today, until you gave the link just above, although I did see it once before.
