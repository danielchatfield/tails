Hi,

Previously I had always burnt TAILS to a CD and it booted into English by default. 

But now, with 0.10.2, I used Unetbootin to create a live USB stick from the TAILS ISO, and the default language looks like Farsi or Arabic. I have to choose English at boot.

Is this intended? Or maybe it has something to do with Unetbootin?
