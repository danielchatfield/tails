I think - I do not know this for sure - that on journaled FS in general one can not reliably wipe files. That would mean ext2, FAT, the older the better.

For this and many other reasons (leakage to swap, tmp, logs thumbnails, \"slack space\", bad sectors...)  I question the validity of this request. 

Always use FS level encryption.
