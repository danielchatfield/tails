There's no such thing as an absolute security level one could compare. It all depends on your usecase and threat model.

You may start with the \"General information\" part of our [[documentation|doc]].

In short, though, one main difference between the two technical \"solutions\" you're mentionning, is that Tails is *amnesic*, while Ubuntu isn't.
