Tails is optimized for anonymity, whereas Ubuntu is a more general-purpose OS.  When it comes to online browsing, they are both equally safe.  Tor is to give you anonymity online, Tails is to give you anonymity online AND anonymity even if someone gains physical access to your computer (e.g. Tails prevents cold-boot attacks, both software and hardware key-loggers, viruses and other malware, etc. whereas Ubuntu doesn't).
