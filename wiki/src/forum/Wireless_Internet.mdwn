The point of all this is connecting to the internet over a wireless connection; I'm a first time Tails user.

How should I setup the Network Connections dialog box?
The network configuration in the Windows 7 wireless wizard is wpa2 enterprise,with aes encryption, peap, dhcp enabled,IPv4 internet access, NetBIOs over Tcpip enabled, user authentication enabled (username and password), and 
Pairwise Masterkey Caching enabled.
