@OP:

It would be a wonderful gift to this forum and to the Tails community if you could spend more time thinking and less time typing. This applies to all your threads and posts. Enthusiasm is laudable but unfortunately at the moment you're allowing your ego to write cheques which your intellect can't pay.
