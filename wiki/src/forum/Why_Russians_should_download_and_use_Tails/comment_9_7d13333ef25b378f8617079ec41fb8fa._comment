Well, this is lame.

I wrote the OP.  For the record, I have nothing to do with the incident reported here:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/02/ghostshell_russia/

The timing is presumably just a coincidence.

In case anyone cares, I tend to think that breaking into \"targets of opportunity\", because you can, just gives hacktivism a bad name.  I do have lots of ideas for \"civil disobediance actions\" mocking the secret police which do NOT involve doing anything illegal, probably, and I suspect that \"Team Ghostshell\" can come up with many such ideas of its own.  Just saying.

I said \"probably\" because internet law involves the laws of all nations, and if you know anything about the existing laws in Turkey, Thailand, Russia, the Phillipines, the US, they are all over the map and any given law is sometimes under judicial review at a given moment).
