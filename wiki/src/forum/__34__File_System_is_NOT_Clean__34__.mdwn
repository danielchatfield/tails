I used the "dd" command to manually install TAILS onto a USB flash stick.
dd if=/{name_of_tails.iso}  of=/dev/{my usb stick}

(after running the isohybrid command)

TAILS seems to run properly from this stick but when I check the file system in the Gnome Disk Utility (palimpsest) , it says, 
"The file system is NOT clean"

What could cause this and is it cause for worry?
