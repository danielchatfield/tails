I'm running the live enviroment and trying to edit the tor configuration through the Vidalia GUI results in a "cannot write to disk" error.

Also, I'm not sure if this is a Tails or Vidalia bug, but I had to strip the configuration of all its comments to get to the above error, else it would complain about malformed parameters.

So what method would you recommend to change tor settings on the fly? Editing /etc/tor/torrc as root and restarting the tor process?
