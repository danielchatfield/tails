>My real problems lies with my country. Though it claim it is very secular and democratic, but actually it is far from the reality. Nowadays it is also started filtering content in the social networks websites and also other places on the Internet. I am an active political person and belongs to the opposition party. I feared that I'll be monitored as well as my other fellow opposition members.

It isn't difficult to guess that your country is the city-state called Singapore. I have many friends who have or are still working there as IT professionals and in the media. If I remember it correctly, the regime over there has been attempting to rein in views expressed on the internet by creating a quasi-government agency called Media Literacy Council. It covertly aims to limit what its citizens are allowed to post on social media websites.

As I understand it, the ISPs in your country do install software to monitor opposition party members and those people who dare to speak up for the silent minority. Are you sure that Tails will be able to get you under a cloak of anonymity?

Indeed you're right to state that your country claims to be very secular and democratic. It has to; otherwise it will incur the wrath of Western Europe and the USA. Trade (read: money/funds) with them will be severely impeded if it is perceived to be a dictatorship.

Moreover it is a well-known fact that the mainstream media in Singapore is state-controlled.

By the way wasn't Alan Shadrake jailed in Singapore for expressing his views in a book that he published? (cf. check out Wikipedia, type in Alan Shadrake)
