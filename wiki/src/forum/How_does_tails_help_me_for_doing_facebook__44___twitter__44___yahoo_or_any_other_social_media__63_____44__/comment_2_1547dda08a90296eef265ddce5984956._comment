I have already signed up and register an yahoo.com email account and also signed up for facebook with this email account. Previously I had an facebook account but last month I have decided to delete it and created a different account but with the new credentials. Though I use my real name to create this account but I am not putting anymore information about me other than the name. I also wanted to create a twitter account with this credentials.

Now my question how far I can be traceable?

I am fairly new in this live-distro things and I wanted to know what other steps I should take to become safe and secure and as well as anonymous?

My real problems lies with my country. Though it claim it is very secular and democratic, but actually it is far from the reality. Nowadays it is also started filtering content in the social networks websites and also other places on the Internet. I am an active political person and belongs to the opposition party. I feared that I'll be monitored as well as my other fellow opposition members.

For the fast few months we've decided that we should go the total anonymous and as well as the secure way to communicate with ourselves. But as a matter of fact that being completely anonymous will hurt our purpose and we thought that only the internal communication should do in this kind of secure way.

@comment 1 hope you will understand our problems and might suggest some ways to secure ourselves from eavesdropping.  

And I also hope than somebody might give us some guidelines to do it.
