\"My real problems lies with my country. Though it claim it is very secular and democratic, but actually it is far from the reality. Nowadays it is also started filtering content in the social networks websites and also other places on the Internet. I am an active political person and belongs to the opposition party. I feared that I'll be monitored as well as my other fellow opposition members.\"

Mr. Das, I can well understand that you are desirous of disseminating those kinds of stuff which no legal provision will allow you to post. You reside in India which is a completely democratic country and the Constitution of India protects every citizen for using his Fundamental rights enshrined under Article 19 subject to certain restrictions under 19(6).

Anyways, such discussion has been held in detail many a time by many developers and commentators. Though Yahoo is safe, you MUST avoid using Facebook and twitter strictly because there are many scripts that automatically get installed silently onto your computer which generally the ethical hackers and developers can see. Your country is facing cyber crime cases because people have made it a point to misuse TOR for their nefarious agendas and TOR doesn't support criminals. TOR has been developed to help the social activists like ours only for the purposes which are completely legal but harmful due to sensitivity involved. Your country doesn't curb freedom of speech and expression and your laws are completely based on the laws of US, UK, Ireland, and other such 4 countries. Okay ignore everything else, Facebook will block you within a few weeks after continuous changes in your IP address and you all posts published here and there in different facebook pages and groups will automatically get erased. I have checked the Facebook through many scripts and codes and I have ultimately decided to stay away from Facebook because they steal a lot of information about you even if you transmit fake information.

Even if you wanna use Facebook to spread messages, take following steps:
1. Prepare the list of all the groups you want to join.
2. Create a fake facebook profile and then send requests to join all those groups.
3. Also note down the email ID of every group (in the ABOUT link of the group where description is laid down) and preserve the list.
4. Now sign out of that facebook profile and throw away the password.
5. Log onto yahoo account and send your material through your email to those GROUP EMAIL IDs from THE SAME ACCOUNT WITH WHICH YOU HAD CREATED THAT PROFILE WHICH IS ADDED TO THAT GROUP.
6. All your posts will get published on facebook groups wherever you send the mail. You will get comments in the email (provided while creating the facebook profile you unchecked NO ANY PRIVACY OPTION).

Never commit any blunder by using facebook and twitter if you want to stay free. The trials in your country conclude in 10-12 years and you will have to waste atleast 5-6 lacs in one case in addition to wastage of time. I have visited your country many a time as a technical expert on behalf of the prosecution and defence alike. Their Hyderabad and B'lore based security agencies don't need to break the TOR network; they simply obtain your private information from Facebook which stores such information which you can't imagine. Do you know that even when you are not logged on to Facebook, your data (cookies) send information to Facebook? They know what you are doing and what other profiles are being opened through your computer. I'll trye to upload a PDF file relating to a case where someone had used Tails to run a profile but the prosecution had traced him. The file will show you what kind of data facebook maintains secretly onto their servers.
