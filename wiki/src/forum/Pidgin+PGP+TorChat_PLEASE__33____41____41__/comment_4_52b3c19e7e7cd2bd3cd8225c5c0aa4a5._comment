I think you can download the torchat2 plugin for pidgin seperately.  But even if you did, i don't think torchat2 \"knows\" how to connect with the TOR running on tails (needs to connect to a hidden service ?)  I think it's the case where the torchat developer doesn't know how to do that, or he needs to contact the Tails developers to find out how.

As for OTR, i hope the Tails developers will include pidgin-otr 4.0.0 :)
