I would not say that VBulletin is secure at all.  If you have a user account at a forum which uses it, try logging in while running Wireshark, and you can clearly see username and password being sent in cleartext.  It is depressingly easy to design a Wireshark filter which will pick out just the packet with that information.  (I trust that in this forum there is no need to try to explain that sending password to log into a user account is something which should be protected, even if posts are public information.)

I haven't tried to create an account here, so for all I know this software doesn't do it better.

But I do know of forums which use VBulletin and which have suffered damaging intrusions due to lax security practices.
