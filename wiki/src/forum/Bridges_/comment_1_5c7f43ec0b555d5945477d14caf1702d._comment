I haven't read any in-depth discussion on this, but there are a few issues/observations I can think of:

* Bridges are essentially [entry guards](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html#EntryGuards) that **users manually pick**. Attackers could use social engineering to fool their targets to pick their bridges. 
* There's essentially **no requirements for becoming a bridge**, as opposed to becoming an entry guard, which requires a long-term stable relay, some amount of bandwidth etc. Since it's the edges of a Tor circuit that are interesting (e.g. the entry guard and exit node) this may be useful for attackers too.

I don't know, but I could imagine the above makes bridges somewhat attractive for attackers. Unless I've missed something, it nothing to be concerned about. I'd say: use bridges only if you need them.
