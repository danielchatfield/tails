Forgot to say: by default, tor clients use entry guards, not bridges.  See

     https://tails.boum.org/forum/What_are_entry_gaurds__63__/

for an explanation of the rationale behind using entry guards.

If you do want to use bridges (to defend against an ISP which blocks Tor, for example), get some from 

     bridges.torproject.org

and try to verify that the certificate and IP address of the server you reach appear reasonable.  (To mitigate the risk of arriving at a malicious imitation server instead of the genuine server.)
