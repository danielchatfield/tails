> use 10+ bridges every time, it's a better entry method into the network

I believe that currently, Tor clients use only three bridges in a given browser session.  Using too many bridges could actually *increase* the risk of some de-anonymization attacks on Tor users, but the optimal number appears to the subject of some discussion, in part because defending against some attacks suggests that we should user fewer bridges, while defending against others suggests that we should use more.

Picking up a point alluded to (I think) by \"Tails\": to serve as an Entry Guard, a node must have won the official designations from directory servers:

* Running
* Valid
* Guard
* Fast (more than 0.1 MB/sec, or in the top 7/8 of all nodes, ordered by decreasing bandwidth)

The directory servers verify that candidate nodes are not obviously misconfigured, do not obviously fail to forward Tor traffic, have been connected continously for some time (have some minimum uptime), and that its bandwidth appears to be honestly reported.  These measures are intended to prevent adversaries from easily mounting congestion attacks and other kinds of attacks which can ultimately result in de-anonymizing Tor users.

Some of these papers offer more detail on these points:
