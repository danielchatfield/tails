>You don't need to do this. Vidalia will autostart all by itself once a network connection is setup (e.g. cable plugged-in or wifi enabled), which brings the Tor daemon up. Please wait for Vidalia to appear, then try to configure the proxy thing.

Well, if I wait for Vidalia to start up, it will also start Tor. Thus, the connection will be directly to Tor and not via proxy/bridge. So I have to start Vidalia to edit the settings before I establish a local connection (wifi, etc.). 

Please answer my oringal question. So this warning from Vidalia is all right then, meaning there aren't any real issues here?
