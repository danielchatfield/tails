The message from Vidalia appears every time I start and do the following: 

1. start tails

2. close iceweasel

3. start Vidalia

4. warning prompts from Vidalia that Tor is not running (obviously since I 
don't have a connection yet)

5. click on the onion icon to edit the settings of Vidalia

6. select \"I use a proxy to access the internet\" and enter details

7. click on OK and message appears that states cannot save settings controlsocket does not exist or whatever

8. open network manager and connect to a local network

9. tails acknowledges that a connection has been established to local network

10. go back to Vidalia settings and click OK

Message does not appear now and I am able to connect to Tor network fine.
By the way, the message appears if I use a bridge also.
I would like to know if this is an issue and if the message that appears is more like a notice than a warning. If there's any other information I should provide let me know.
