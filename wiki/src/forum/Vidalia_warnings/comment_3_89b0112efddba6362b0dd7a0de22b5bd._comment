Here's some extra information from Vidalia's log, this is from when I start Vidalia but have not edited config yet:

Apr 14 13:13:06.590 [Notice] Initialized libevent version 1.4.13-stable using method epoll. Good.

Apr 14 13:13:06.591 [Warning] /var/run/tor is not owned by this user (amnesia, 1000) but by debian-tor (106). Perhaps you are running Tor as the wrong user?

Apr 14 13:13:06.591 [Warning] Before Tor can create a control socket in \"/var/run/tor/control\", the directory \"/var/run/tor\" needs to exist, and to be accessible only by the user account that is running Tor.  (On some Unix systems, anybody who can list a socket can conect to it, so Tor is being careful.)

Apr 14 13:13:06.591 [Notice] Closing partially-constructed listener Socks listener on 127.0.0.1:9050

Apr 14 13:13:06.591 [Warning] Failed to parse/validate config: Failed to bind one of the listener ports.

Apr 14 13:13:06.591 [Error] Reading config failed--see warnings above.
