> close iceweasel, start Vidalia

You don't need to do this. Vidalia will autostart all by itself once a network connection is setup (e.g. cable plugged-in or wifi enabled), which brings the Tor daemon up. Please wait for Vidalia to appear, then try to configure the proxy thing.

> warning prompts from Vidalia that Tor is not running (obviously since I don't have a connection yet)

FYI Vidalia is telling you the Tor daemon is not running. This is different from having a connection or not.
