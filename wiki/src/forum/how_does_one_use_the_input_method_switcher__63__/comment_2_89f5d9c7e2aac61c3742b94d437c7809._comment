Thanks a lot for your brief introduction to X-session and tips on how to restart an X-session.

Here's the feedback:

1. Your first suggestion to issue Control+Alt+Backspace did not work at all.

2. Next, I clicked \"Accessories\" --> \"Root Terminal\". In the \"Root Terminal\" window, I issued the command sudo killall x-session-manager. (To be able to issue commands in the \"Root Terminal\" windows, one has to have provided a password at the launch of Tails OS)

The OS and its applications appeared to shut down. But no, Tails simply logged off and I went through the routine of choosing more options and activating the Windows XP camouflage. Users would do well to remember to input a password for carrying out administrative tasks.

I checked the settings that I had made in SCIM input method and discovered that all were preserved. None had been reset to nil.

I was able to start typing Chinese characters.

Hurray!
