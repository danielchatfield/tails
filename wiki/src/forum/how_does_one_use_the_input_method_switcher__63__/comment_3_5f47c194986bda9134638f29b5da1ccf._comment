Wouldn't it be better if developers enable multi-lingual input method by default when Tails boots up?

What I mean is, after Tails has booted up, we would see in a corner of the screen a language bar. When we click it, a menu containing different language options presents itself. We could then choose to type in Chinese, Korean, Persian, Arabic, Urdu, etc...

We do well to remember that oppressive regimes are mostly found in countries such as China, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Yemen, Bahrain, etc..People in English-speaking countries like the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand don't need Tails, do they? In addition, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Norway and other countries in Western Europe have a high degree of freedom of expression.
