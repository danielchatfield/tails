>Question #1: What does X stand for? What is the meaning of X session?

X is the name for the suite of sotware which routes signals around your computer. For example, Keyboard signals from whichever keyboard you're typing on to whichever app you hapen to be typing into at the time, the video signals from that app's video output must be directed to whatever windowing enviroment on whatever monitor you happen to be viweing said app, etc...

Perhaps it's easiest to think of X as your computer's switchboard.

X is a vital \"engine-room\" component of Tails and just about every other *nix OS there is. X even has its own website! You can read all about X there at [x.org](http://www.x.org/) if you're interested. Hopefully it won't be long before it's replaced by [Weyland!](http://wayland.freedesktop.org/).. a different suite with the same function... but that's another story ;-)

Your \"X session\" is merely the period in which you've been using X since starting it.

>Question #2: How do I restart the X session? (Well, I rebooted my PC and after Tails had successfully launched, I noticed that my previous configuration of SCIM had disappeared.

No, rebooting won't help although you have the right idea. Tails is a live OS, so as you found, while rebooting does indeed result in a new X session it also wipes out all the configuration changes you've made. :-(

The usual methods for re-starting X are either to \"log out\" or use the \"kill X\" shortcut: [ctrl] + [alt] + [<Bksp]

I remember there's no \"logout\" option in the current release of Tails, so that's no use *at the moment* but, not being in a Tails session at the moment I can't test the shortcut for you. Be careful not to have anything important/unsaved running as at the very least, restarting X will terminate all the sessions dependant apps... and I have a sneaking suspicion that, if it does anything at all, the shortcut might have been reprogrammed to initiate Tails' emergency secure shutdown ;-)

A final thought, if none of the above is any use, you could try this:

    sudo killall x-session-manager

Let us know how you get on... if none of that works for you I, and probably others, will dig around a bit
