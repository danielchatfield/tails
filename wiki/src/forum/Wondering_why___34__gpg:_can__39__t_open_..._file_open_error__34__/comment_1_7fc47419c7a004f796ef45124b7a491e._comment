Make sure that the file names you enter are correct; exactly the same as the actual names of the files you downloaded. 

Note that the file names shown in the instructions are for the *previous* TAILS release, 0.12. The current release is 0.12.<b>1</b> 

Thus, the exact text you would need to enter would be:

<code>gpg --verify tails-i386-0.12.1.iso.pgp tails-i386-0.12.1.iso</code>
