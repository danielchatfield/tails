@ OP:

\"Tails\" gave some good advice.  

\"hehehe\" advised learning (I think), to which I'd add:

Bear in mind that \"steep learning curve\" means you'll feel like you hardly understand anything you read for some time, but if you persist, one day you'll suddenly realize that you seem to understand almost everything you read.

Another problem I have with what \"hehehe\" wrote is that his (her?) post could be read as support for one of the nasty fallacies which is heavily promoted by state-sponsored and corporate Enemies of the Internet: the suggestion that (as one Russian offical recently put it) \"99% of Tor users use Tor for criminal activity\".  That is just not true.  At least not in countries which do not (yet) explicitly outlaw reading the news or posting comments on sociopolitical issues.
