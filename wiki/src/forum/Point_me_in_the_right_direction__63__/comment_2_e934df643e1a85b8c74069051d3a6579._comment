point you in the right direction is: learn more. it means spend next 5 years studying IT (networking, security, encryption, etc). and again, you can trust only to yourself, developers can develop something out of your needs. second option is: play a lotto and when you win, make your own network of proxies.

IF I am not wrong, for example, when you choose to be tor node, relay, you can block some websites, it means your server can not be used for some websites, if hundreds or thousands of them block some pedo or crimi websites, those who don't block it, they can snitch visitors because you will use tor through their nodes, many other nodes will reject it. beside it, I think in newer time, developers changed Tor, so, stronger servers (T1, corporate) accept more traffic and snitches can have 30 strong servers, so, there is bigger chance that they will catch users of some websites. I blocked many tor nodes on the basis of IP address, and they just restart server and get another IP address, usually they change last numbers in IP address and my blocking was for nothing.
