Thanks for yhe answer. But, can you correct me if I wrong? To run Tails in a USB, the correct (and secure) way to do is:
1.- Install it with Universal USB Installer.
2.- Run Tails
3.- Run Tails USB instaler to install onto other USB

Is this correct, or the points 2 and 3 are only optional? 

Thanks
