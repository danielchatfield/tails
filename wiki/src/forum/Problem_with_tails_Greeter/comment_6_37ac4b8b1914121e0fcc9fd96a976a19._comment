I was also having this problem, along with NetworkManager failing to appear.  I was able to fix the issues by editing on the drive in /multiboot/menu/tails.cfg along the lines recommended above.

In Linux Mint, that filesystem was listed as read-only, but Notepad in Windows had no problem modifying the file.  It looked a little bit different than above, though. It said:

[...]append cdrom-detect/try-usb=true noprompt=usb timezone=America/Detroit boot=live config vga=788 live-media-path=/multiboot/tails/live[...]

Now it says:

[...]append cdrom-detect/try-usb=true noprompt=usb boot=live config noswap live-media=removable nopersistent noprompt timezone=Etc/UTC block.events_dfl_poll_msecs=1000 splash nox11autologin quiet live-media-path=/multiboot/tails/live[...]

Maybe that wasn't exactly the right way to do it, but it all seems to be functioning now.
