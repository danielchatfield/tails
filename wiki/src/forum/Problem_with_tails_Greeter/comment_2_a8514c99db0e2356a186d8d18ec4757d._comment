**First of all: Tails is not supported when using third-party USB installations. Proceed at your own risk**

YUMI most likely configures an incorrect kernel cmdline in grub/syslinux/$BOOTLOADER. Make sure that it is (modulo language settings):

    boot=live config noswap live-media=removable nopersistent noprompt timezone=Etc/UTC block.events_dfl_poll_msecs=1000 splash nox11autologin quiet

The specific problem you are reporting is cause by not having `nox11autologin` there, but omitting the others may cause other issues, potentially dangerous (w.r.t. security) ones.
