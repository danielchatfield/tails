The recommended way to install Tails to a USB drive if to first burn Tails on a DVD, boot Tails from the DVD and install it from there. If your computer lacks a DVD reader you have to do a [[doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation]], and then the supported procedure is to use the [[Universal USB Installer|doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/windows]] if you use Microsoft Windows.
