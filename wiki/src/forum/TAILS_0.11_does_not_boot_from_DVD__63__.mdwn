The instructions to burn TAILS 0.11 ISO to DVD worked as intended.

Upon attempting to boot from the DVD, however, it continually loops, and is difficult to see what information is being output.

The information about ISO Linux 4.02 debian - 201014 ... is about all I can see as the message flashes before my eyes in the loop - which happens to include several other lines that I have yet to determine what they say.

What do you think will work? Should I try something like:
1) dd Tails 0.11 ISO to a scratch USB
2) Try to clone the first USB to a second USB from which to boot?

If this problem cannot be solved, then TAILS 0.11 is a no-go for me.
