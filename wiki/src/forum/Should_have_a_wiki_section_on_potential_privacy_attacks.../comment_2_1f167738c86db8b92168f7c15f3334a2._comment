I too have been concerned about E-tags for a long time.

Regarding the suggestion of using Tor fonts, I didn't understand that, but if Tails does something like this in future, please carefully explain for the benefit of people like me who read about a recent \"persistent threat malware\" attack (not specifically Tor-related) in which a strange font was used, apparently as a \"subtle\" infection marker.
