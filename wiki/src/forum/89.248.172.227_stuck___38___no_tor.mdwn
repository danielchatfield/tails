Repeatedly stuck on 89.248.172.227 and https://check.torproject.org/ says not using tor. Even on choosing new identity in vidalia menu, still stuck with same ip. After lot of changing, there is a different ip. But, after few minutes when i again check it goes back to the same ip 89.248.172.227

Please help. How do i solve this? Anyone else having this bug?
