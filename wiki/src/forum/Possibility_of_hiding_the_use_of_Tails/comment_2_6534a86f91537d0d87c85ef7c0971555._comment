A question I have been wondering about for some time now but have not been able to find an answer to:

How does it appear to one's ISP when one connects to Tor via a bridge?

I mean, the traffic going through Tor is still going to look different than normal traffic not going through Tor. So, other than a case where using a bridge is necessary just to use Tor at all, what, exactly would using a bridge accomplish?
