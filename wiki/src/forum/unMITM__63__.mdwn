Some say the only way to be certain of escaping a trojan or root kit compromised box is to reformat and reinstall the OS. That would wipe out any malware.

Is there something that can work as well when the machine is MITM compromised? Is there anything we can do to unMITM if we suspect our connection is MITM compromised?

Or is it once MITMed always MITMed?
