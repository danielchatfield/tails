Until yesterday I had never heard of TOR, never programmed a thing, basically I am computer savvy only within the confines of the Mac OSX environment. I run both a MacBookPro 5,3 and a MacbookAir 2011. I simply set out to see if it could be done, and luckily it can. I have successfully loaded Tails on both. I will run through my 14 hour trial-and-error process, and the compromises you will likely have to make since Macs, the great machines they are, are obviously not designed for this stuff. Here we go, this will be long and detailed, but it works, so hang in there. 

I downloaded both the 0.15 and 0.16 iso's, and verified them as described in the \"verify iso on other operating system\" option in the main instructions. You can find older iso's by searching for \"older versions\" in the page search bar. Follow the directions for verification exactly, this portion will work as described. Verification is important because the first download I got for both versions failed the verification, Im not exactly sure the implications of this, it just seems that if anonymity is your game, it should be perfect. The second download I did passed verification. I downloaded both iso's because 0.16 worked on my MBP, 0.15 on my MBA.

Now comes the time to burn the iso 0.16 file to DVD for MBP users. I burned about 6 hard-earned drink coasters only to have an error message tell me something was wrong with the burner communication. Some people report that using Toast Titanium to burn the DVD solved this problem, I don't know about that. My problem lay in the simple fact that I could not burn to DVD+R or DVD Duel Layer with my MBP. Simply using a single layer DVD-R instead worked fine. 

The process for non-MacBook Air users is easier because you have the option to use a DVD. To burn the iso correctly, follow the instructions in \"the corresponding Ubuntu Documentation\" on the \"download, verify and install\" page exactly, simply drag and drop burn will not cut it. No problems creating a bootable DVD this way, make sure to verify the burn as well because Mac DVD drives suck chode, all of them! When the burn is complete, leave it in your system, and select the restart computer option. As soon as the boot up begins, hold down either the \"C\" key to boot directly from a disc, or hold down \"alt/option\" key to enter the boot manager, and select what my system called \"Windows\" instead of the OSX option. If it doesn't appear right away, give your system a few minutes to recognize the disc. 

Now, this next step caused so much f'n grief that I almost threw up my hands and said screw it. I started up the boot disc under the normal boot up option without adding any special parameters. What would happen is what countless other people experienced... the white, light blue, dark blue debian 6.0.6 status bar would load half-way and then just freeze. Many uneeded wasted DVD's.... The trick that worked for me was to simply hit the \"down key\" and select the second \"(flawless) or (faultless)\" option, whatever it was. It started right up and went to the welcome screen. Go f'n figure! I can't promise it will be this easy for you, but try it, and then try adding each additional parameter as described in one of the help documents... i can't find it again to help you find it, you'll just have to get lucky like I did.... the one that says to \"add bridge, debug, or ?something else? to the command line. If there is still a problem, I am not your expert anymore, sorry. 

Now begins those compromises i spoke of earlier. For MBA users it time to pay the consequences of not having a disc drive. You need to get one, an external one. The reason is that Mac's do not support booting from USB, only from disc. This is going to be a problem again later on regardless which Mac you use, so the compromises will continue. Sorry. If you do some searching on the forum, you will come across a few who said they had luck with refit, refind, or unetbootin. I tried all of them, exactly as stated, extensively, to absolutely no success. Again, if you know more than me, which you likely do, and you can do it their way, by all means help your peers out, there is a huge need for what you know... and dumb the instructions down for us idiots that don't know what you assume we do... I've had a bitch of a time trying to follow the well-to-do forum instructions of the more advanced programmers. 

Do now the same thing as listed above, use disk utility to burn the iso to DVD using your external drive, and do yourself a favor; Save 5 or 50 discs (Yeah, I wasted a bunch, learn from my mistakes) and just use 0.15 iso, the current release was just not cutting it, again I don't know why. The old release worked, the new one didn't. I also at this point created a backup of my system because I had to install refit to my hard drive. This is the only way I could trick the system into recognizing an external drive containing your boot disc on start up. Find refit on the net, run  the unpackage icon, it will install to your hard drive. You may want to read the warnings of using refit, they are harsh, and the reason I chose first to have a backup in place before I installed it! Luckily, nothing bad happened. With the completed DVD in the external drive, restart your computer. Hold the option/alt key at start-up, select the \"Windows\" disc, and absolutely select the same \"(flawless)\" boot option when given the chance. It should now take you to the welcome screen!  

Now, remember when I said you can't boot a Mac from USB, well you can't, so now realize as I did that creating a boot-able thumb drive is a moot point! (moot, right?) Someone much smarter than I... someone from Debain... came to this conclusion, its in his forum and I trust his skills much more than my own! You will forever have to use the DVD you just created to access Tails, in the same way you just did. MBA users, this means you will have to have your external drive to access Tails... compromises! 

This creates a problem though, since Tails dumps the memory? every time you shut it down, there is no way to save anything you do within the platform from one use to the next. Remember, I (and likely you) can't burn to DVD-RW's, or maybe you can. Either way though, I found a good solution for this. You format a USB thumb drive as described under \"Installing onto a USB Stick\" anyway. You can't use it for booting, but it in essence becomes the hard drive of your Tails platform. I am that moron that couldn't figure out where the Applications ▸ Tails ▸ Tails USB installer was, and again more grief. It is located within the Tails platform, you only do this after you get the program working. Yeah, I know, if this is you also, learn from my stupidity, or simply RTFI, steps 1-7. 

I mentioned you can't use this for booting, but when correctly formatted, the drive shows up within the Tails \"My Computer\" drive as whatever you named it. You can save everything you need from applications, accounts and files to the thumb drive,  and when you shut down, the memory is wiped, but the data remains on the thumbdrive. Relax though, the thumbdrive, correctly formatted, is completely unreadable outside of the Tails platform, it will show up as an error, a bad drive etc., ErGo, a portable Tails Hard Drive on USB completely secure outside the program. That's good enough for me. 

So there you have it. I'm not about to say there isn't better ways, I am in every sense of the word a newbee (newbee?) at this stuff. If you have a better way, let me know, Im always down to expand my skills, and I'm sure all the MBA users don't want to tote around their external DVD drives (and usb splitters... one for the disc drive, one for the usb drive... (yeah, didn't mention that one yet!) One final thought before this essay ends, what I explained is what I know. If you have problems outside this post, I'm not going to be your expert, and although I am willing to answer any questions, don't expect much more from me. Good luck, happy anonymity.
