> Hello, since Tails comes with both a \"safe\" browser (going through TOR) and an unsafe browser (not going to TOR), I am a bit confused about the other online communication software.

The unsafe browser is the only application that is not anonymized in any way. And because of this the Tails developers have named it, written warnings messages and given it a scary color theme, and everything just so you really realize it is not anonymous. Everything else is.

> For example: Does Claws go over Tor?

Yes.

> Everything should go through Tor execept what has specifically excepted. Exceptions include Tor itself, I2P, the time synchronization program and the unsafe browser.

Time synchronization is also torified :)

Sounds like that would be a bit unreliable due to delays, but it is.

> Tails browser is torified, but other browsers like wget will probably not be, unless possibly if you run them through a wrapper like torify.

In Tails all applications (except those already listed) communication is either going through tor, or is blocked by the firewall. It is for example impossible to use wget in a non-torified way.

> Peer to peer protocols cannot be torified because your IP is contained in plaintext in peer to peer communications.

Not necessarily, although that is a common complaint about BitTorrent. If your computer is behind a router with NAT, and the application is torified, the application shouldn't be able to figure out your IP, due to Tails firewall.

> might somehow fail to perform DNS over Tor, which would be a problem for anonymity. TBB appears to do a better job of torifying more clients

TBB doesn't torify other clients at all. You must be mixing it up with something else.

> and Tails probably does an even better job than TBB. Still, I worry.

Yes. Tails is carefully configured to perform *all* DNS request through Tor, even those that otherwise would not have gone through Tor. DNS leaks are probably impossible in Tails.
