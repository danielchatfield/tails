Correct me if I am wrong, but I am under the impression that \"No History\" implies not accepting any cookies at all (neither first or third party), and not storing any history whatsoever while keeping a \"private session\" all along.

Can you please explain further how would \"No History\" allow third party cookies? Is it some hidden tricky option?

Another question goes like: What kind of information do first party cookies store, and is deleting them regularly of any benefit security/anonymity wise?
