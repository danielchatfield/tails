Can you please comment about the default screen size information?

I'm using Tails on my laptop now and the sizes of the browser are 1000x600 (was 1000x800 on the big monitor). I realized that this is shown as more widely used than 1000x500 in panopticlick.

TBB - 1000x500 - one in 2700 browsers

Tails - 1000x600 - one in 1600 browsers

But we should think about the **one in XXX \"Tor\" browsers** 

So why don't you set the default sizes as same as the TBB = 1000x500

This difference makes it easier to identify someone.
