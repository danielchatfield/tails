HTTP_ACCEPT Headers are also different

TBB: text/html, */* gzip, deflate en-us,en;q=0.5

Tails: text/html, */* ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 gzip, deflate en-us,en;q=0.5

Did you compare everything to make sure it looks like someone using TBB on Windows, so no difference in terms of browser fingerprints.
