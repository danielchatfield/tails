Hello, thanks for testing out/trying Askbot. Found this post via the Google Alerts and I'm one of Askbot developers.

We can work on reducing reliance on Javascript, but this work will be gradual and focused on specific areas.

Regarding the requirement for the user registration: there are two issues - (1) spam and (2) - user identification (in the sense of creating an identity within the site).

If you have ideas on these issues - please share with us.

Thanks.

Evgeny.
