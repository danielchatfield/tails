I don't think I'll spend any more time arguing with someone who apparently thinks we owe them some sustantial part of our lifetime for some reason, and tries to convince us by beating the same dead horse over and over. It's time to realize this won't produce anything but frustration, and move on.

In case you missed it, the question is not \"Q&A vs. freestyle forum\", it's rather \"Q&A vs. nothing at all\", because we simply don't want to take care of a place like *this very one* anymore. Life's just too short.

Thread closed.
