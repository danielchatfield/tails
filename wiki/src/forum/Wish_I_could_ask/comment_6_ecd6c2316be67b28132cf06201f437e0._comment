> I would encourage Tor and Tails developers to seek jobs that pay a salary.

Again, you know to less and yet waste time with your suggestions.

Tor developers are paid full time for working on Tor. You find their salary in their financial report.

Not sure about Tails developers. Read in September / October news they have a sponsor. Not known if they can live from it. If they are paid by a secret service they can certainly life by it.
