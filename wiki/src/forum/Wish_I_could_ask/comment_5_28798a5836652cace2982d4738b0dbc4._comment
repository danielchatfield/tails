>Why should the experts like to talk to someone who knows not even 5% they know? It's nothing personal against you. Just a waste of time.

You are totally right.

I am a noob and guess I know only about 0.0001% of what the Tor/Tails experts know. Why would they want to talk to me? After both Tor and Tails are open-source and their developers are not paid for their work.

What with the austerity cuts in the Eurozone, high unemployment rates in some European countries, the volatile political situation in the Middle East, the anaemic economic recovery in the US and the looming \"fiscal cliff\" in the USA, I would encourage Tor and Tails developers to seek jobs that pay a salary.
