> What do the experts think ...

There are no experts in this forum. Tails doesn't never discuss here.

Why should the experts like to talk to someone who knows not even 5% they know? It's nothing personal against you. Just a waste of time. If you are seriously interested there is much to read for you. Can't be bothered? They can't be bothered to talk to you.

What experts think is written in [Selected Papers in Anonymity](http://freehaven.net/anonbib/). Care to read?
