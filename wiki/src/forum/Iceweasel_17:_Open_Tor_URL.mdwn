In Tails 0.17, right-clicking on a web page displays "Open Tor URL".

Those buttons are not working properly, it's already [reported here](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-firefox-17-and-tor-alpha-bundles).

Two questions:

- is it the best place to report such a bug?
- What are those buttons made for?

Thanks,  
Tom
