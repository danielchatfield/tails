When you look at the [command line instructions](https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#download.verify-the-iso-image-using-the-command-line) you should see the following:

    gpg: key 1202821CBE2CD9C1: public key \"Tails developers (signing key) <tails@boum.org>\" imported

The relevant part is the partial fingerprint \"1202821CBE2CD9C1\" (according to the keys I keep on file, the full fingerprint is \"0D24 B36A A9A2 A651 7878  7645 1202 821C BE2C D9C1\").

The tails key was updated sometime in 2012 with additional public signatures to broaden its web of trust. That is why you see the \"new signatures: 19\", part.
