i have this beginner question. does uploading files to sites or adding attachments to email reveal real ip?

It is like when the site uploading to opens explorer window asking to navigate to the file on tails. Does that mean the uploading will create p2p connection and thus revealing real ip?

also will the path to the file be sent to the upload site?

thanks for help
