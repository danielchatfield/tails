I wish Facebook would die.  Its goal is to analyze and monetize data about you and all the intimate details of your life, your friends, your buying patterns, your lovers, your political and religious beliefs etc.  It's not just the harmless little things you post, it's the total profile they can build that is potentially incendiary.

It's a police state's wet dream that's been sold to the people by that cute little billionaire college boy Zuckerboy and his Ivy League cohorts.

People post all their shit to FB and they even *want* to!  Governments could only dream of this kind of surveillance.  When combined with the GPS trackers in every cellphone, you may consider yourself fully observed by Big Brother.  Fuck Facebook.
