There are at least 2 good reasons to not do this

1) if you log into facebook with your personal account, your anonymity is gone to hell. Why use tails then?

(unless you have a fake account to only use over tor)

2) when you appear to log in from different places on the world, fb complains and doesn't allow you to log in. You have to log in from a \"trusted\" location and confirm it's really you. In short, it's really annoying
