Dear mentors,

I would like to know if it is ok to download sqlite-manager for Iceweasel? I am using version 0.16 

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/

Also, how is it possible to save the add-ons permanently.
I tried to save one of the gesture add-ons, it was gone after reboot. TT
