Hello. To user Tails: You asked the original poster to report a bug through tails both 0.15 and 0.14, but 0.15 wouldn't connect, it doesn't work for me and I cant change encryption.

Is it sufficient to report a bug through 0.14 only? And how will I get a reply to the bug report ? Shall I submit a contact email address along with it?

It would be really helpful and easier if you could supply some information here on the issue instead of referring to the reporting cycle. 

Thank you.
