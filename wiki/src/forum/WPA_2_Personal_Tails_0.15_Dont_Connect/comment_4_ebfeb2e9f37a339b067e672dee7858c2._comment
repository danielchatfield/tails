Hi. I have the same problem with tails 0.15 as previous fellows have mentioned, it fails to connect on WPA2 Personal. I ran iwevent while trying to connect and these I assume are the relative errors:

Custom driver event MLME-MICHAELMICFAILURE.indication (keyid=0 unicast addr=xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx)

and this, which comes the line right after:

New Access Point/Cell address:Not-Associated

--------------------------------------------

I couldn't solve this issue no matter what I did. Please help.

Note: I didn't try 0.14 yet, can someone give me a link to download it?

Thank you.
