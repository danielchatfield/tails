> To user Tails: You asked the original poster to report a bug through tails both 0.15 and 0.14, but 0.15 wouldn't connect, it doesn't work for me and I cant change encryption.

Unless I've misunderstood, it's exactly the problem we're trying to track down.

> Is it sufficient to report a bug through 0.14 only?

No. We need the logs of a working system *and* the ones of the failing system to try to understand what's happening.

See *Special cases* section on [[doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]].

> And how will I get a reply to the bug report ? Shall I submit a contact email address along with it?

Please do.

> It would be really helpful and easier if you could supply some information here on the issue instead of referring to the reporting cycle.

I'm sorry: we have no additional information to supply. We are
*asking* for information so that we can, hopefully, understand
and fix the problem.
