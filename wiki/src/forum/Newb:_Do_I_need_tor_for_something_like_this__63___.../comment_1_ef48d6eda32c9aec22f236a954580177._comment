Hello and welcome to the Tails forum. :D

Yes, your questions are perfectly appropriate. Defending your privacy and security are the reason Tails exists. ;-)

>Would it be safe or private to email someone as long as you signed up for an email address without having to put your name or anything to it at sign up for it (some provider that doesn't make you)? If not, then what about if I go to like a local library or something like that? Would using tor help in this situation maybe?

This completely depends on the nature of your adversary. Who are you trying to defend your privacy against?
