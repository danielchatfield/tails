Hi!

> P.S. Is this ok to ask questions like this? Am I at the right place?

The question at hand looks to me like a general Internet / privacy / Tor one, and I fail to see what is specific to Tails in it.

So, unless the relationship to Tails is clarified, I think this question would be much better suited for other, more general privacy / Tor discussion channels: you'll simply get better answers there :)
