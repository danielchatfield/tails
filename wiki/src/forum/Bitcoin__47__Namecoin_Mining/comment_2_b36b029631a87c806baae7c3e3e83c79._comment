No, I mean what I said.

You have to have into account that bitcoins only provide weak anonimity as the blockchain is in itself a public record of all transactions.

The most anonymous bitcoin is the one you mined yourself (through Tor) as adversaries cannot follow the money: \"Hum... I see that Bob bougth 30 bitcoins from alice in that exchange at that time\" Now if I can figure out who Bob is I can see ALL bitcoin transactions he did...*insert evil laugther*

I had no idea that the blockchain had grown so large... i thougth it was smaller I admit..are you positive about that data?

Regardless, such a feature would obviouslly be opt-in, if one want to store the blockchain... I would for example.. rather than trusting the server and much less an online wallet...

Bitcoin decentralization is it's beauty I think.. and if other people cannot snoop on it by mining through Tor all much the better.

I mentioned Namecoin because I think it would be a waste not being able to do merged mining and that a project whoose focus is to prevent domain name censorship is very much ideologically alligned with Tor's and by consequence Tails..
