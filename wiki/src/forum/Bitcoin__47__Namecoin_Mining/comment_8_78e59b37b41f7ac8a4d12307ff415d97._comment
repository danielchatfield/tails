Apart from knowledje since I am a complete newbie to Tails (and linux) and haven't played with instaling programs and making them persistent yet? No idea, I admit..

But I do lack a Open-Cl/CUDA compatible GPU in order to do any relevant mining in my pc so even if I managed, I would reap very few benefits from it.. 

What I asked I asked because I wish to see Tails with a feature that I would find usefull, and that I believe would serve many people well.

Bitcoin and Namecoin are projects like Tails for which I have high hopes for, but while Tails is doing great IMHO, Bitcoin, Namecoin and mining is still too hard to setup properly ( let alone with Tor as would be prefered) for non-computer experts.

If Tails were to include this out-of-the-box, it would not only be more intention-complete i think, but would have a feature usefull for many people unable to do this themselfs.
