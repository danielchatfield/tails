Quite true, and thanks for the links, I will surely spend some time analyzing them in detail.

I will take into special consideration BAMT 0.5 that I had no idea existed in fact.. However, this does not solve the problem and I call you attention to the following:

\"BAMT is a custom Debian based Linux designed specifically for dedicated Bitcoin mining rigs.

This is not a 'user oriented' Linux. BAMT is for mining rigs.. computers that are probably headless and probably ignored for months at a time while they do absolutely nothing but churn out shares.  There is no (fill in this blank with anything not required for mining), there is only mining.

The primary goal of BAMT is to reduce time spent deploying, monitoring and maintaining your mining farm to the absolute minimum.\"

This is not what I had envisioned.. and you yourself admit that \"also there are so many legalities involved ....\" in the process you describe, and also that \"when you mine you always have untainted coins at first..nobody can ever follown them..thats why i will forever hold the around 5btc I mine per day ^^\"

You migth have the tecnical skill to pull that off or barrel through all the tecnical details in the bitcoin forum.. but most don't.

Tails objective is not to mine, I obviously agree with that, but is it's objective \"privacy for anyone, anywhere?\" is it not PELD (Privacy Enhancing Live Distro)? That is the point is it not?.. A user friendly live distro that gives very good privacy and anonimity to users that may not be that tecnically able!

Now you may argue that it is not, or should not be a priority...but Tails should DEFINATLY be bothered with that... If it is important for the users that is :)
