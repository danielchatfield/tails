okay i get what you mean now.

but you can google \"pacthing the bitcoin client to make it more anonymous\"

you can change your adresse all the time

you can use bitcoijn mixers (depending on which you trust and which kind of technique they use)

technicaly speaking crawling this data and getting anything out of it is very very very very hard and cumbersome work..(is it worth it for your adversary?)

also there are so many legalities involved ....i mean i can hust give you my porivate key ownign 10btc instead of sending them to you..offline transaction anyone?

can anyone ever tell if this happened?

tails shouldn`t be bothered with that..

one should use BAMT 0.5 (mining distro) and then install tor ..

also when you mine you always have untainted coins at first..nobody can ever follown them..thats why i will forever hold the around 5btc I mine per day ^^


blockchain size is gonna become a problem sometimes soon..
