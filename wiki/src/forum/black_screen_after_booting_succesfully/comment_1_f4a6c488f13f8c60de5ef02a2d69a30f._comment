Cheat codes are documented in the [live-config manpage](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=live-config&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=Debian+6.0+squeeze&format=html&locale=en).

Please try adding all combinations of `nomodeset` and `xorg-driver=vesa` to the kernel command line (in the graphical boot menu, press TAB, then SPACE, then one or both of these parameters, then ENTER).

Graphics hardware support will greatly improve soon in Tails thanks to [[todo/backported_Xorg]]. Until then, your mileage may vary when it comes to shiny new hardware that did not even exist when Debian Squeeze was released.
