> Google has recorded something (location, preferred language...) when you used this account outside of Tails, that allows them to now link this account to a country. This is sad, but Tails cannot do anything about it.

Maybe, but I've checked all the settings and none of them point to my country. 	
The most strange thing is that sometimes my country appears in the URL and other times not.

> blogspot.com is a Google service, so it's no big surprise they have the same information available, once you've logged in into a Google account that was linked to a given country.

	
Wasn't logged in or had cookies when I responded on blogspot.
