> Have you correlated this against the identity and reported location of the exit node you're using at the time?

I have never seen an exit node in my country, on the day that I auditioned the exit node was from Sweden.

> Sounds like you browsers preferred language is being left at \"en-US\" so that's the content you're receiving but an intermediate redirection is passing your connection to a server serving the location of your exit node at that instant... which \"sometimes\" happens to match your actual location.

	
I'm sure that's not the case, always check the IP of the exit node and never happened to be the same of my location.
