>>Google has recorded something (location, preferred language...) when you used this account outside of Tails, that allows them to now link this account to a country. This is sad, but Tails cannot do anything about it.

>Maybe, but I've checked all the settings and none of them point to my country.

Google doesn't provide you with access to all the data it has associated with your identity.

>The most strange thing is that sometimes my country appears in the URL and other times not.

Have you correlated this against the identity and reported location of the exit node you're using at the time?

>>blogspot.com is a Google service, so it's no big surprise they have the same information available, once you've logged in into a Google account that was linked to a given country.

>Wasn't logged in or had cookies when I responded on blogspot.

Sounds like you browsers preferred language is being left at \"en-US\" so that's the content you're receiving but an intermediate redirection is passing your connection to a server serving the location of your exit node at that instant... which \"sometimes\" happens to match your actual location.
