Are you sure? How? The **browser's** preferred language is unrelated to the keyboard and localisation settings of Tails. It defaults to en_US for *needle-in-haystack* anonymity reasons - regardless of your Tails keyboard and localisation choices.

The setting you are experimenting with is within (and specific to) Iceweasel. It can be found from Iceweasel's \"Edit\" menu thus:

\"Edit\" (menu) -> \"Preferences\" (option) -> \"Content\" (tab) -> \"Languages\" (section) -> \"Choose\" (button)

>>Look at the line HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE in the header sent by your browser.

Many websites use **the browser's** \"preferred language\" to localise their content. As **your browser** is requesting en_US, then that's what you'll receive.
