> It may not be a good idea

When using Tails, that is.

As I understand it, one of the rationales for using Tails is that it can enable you to use one PC or laptop for two *strictly separated* classes of on-line activities:

* activities where you are using your real identity, or accounts tied to your real identity
* activities where you wish to remain anonymous and have some reason to think you can reasonably hope to remain anonymous (so, not emailing or torrenting)

The general idea is to make it difficult for surveillance companies to link the your activities in \"anon mode\" to your activities in \"me mode\".
