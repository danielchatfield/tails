> When I log in to any Google service

It may not be a good idea to log into websites where you have accounts, particularly

* websites which do *not* use SSL \"protected\" connections (may not able to Google and some others, but keep reading)
* websites where your account which might be tied to other on-line identities, or even worse, your IRL identity
* websites operated by data brokers like Google, whose basic business model is uniquely identifying everyone and tracking in details everything they do

Basically, if you use Tails or Tor or another privacy-enhancing tool, you must think of data brokers like Google or Facebook as your enemy.  So whenever you use Google or Facebook accounts, you are giving information to your enemy.

If you are unfamiliar with how sophisticated adversaries like Google use browser fingerprinting to help them to uniquely identify persons using privacy-promoting tools like Tails, see

If you are unfamiliar with how the Tor network is often abused by persons seeking username/password combinations sent using http, telnet, or ftp protocols (to name three of the most abused), look for stories which appeared in The Register a few years ago, about a Swedish security researcher who demonstrated how easy it is for anyone willing to operate an exit router to do this.
