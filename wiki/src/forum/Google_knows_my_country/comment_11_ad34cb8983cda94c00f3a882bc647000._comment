So, it looks very much like:

1. Google has recorded something (location, preferred language...) when you used this account outside of Tails, that allows them to *now* link this account to a country. This is sad, but Tails cannot do anything about it.
1. blogspot.com is a Google service, so it's no big surprise they have the same information available, once you've logged in into a Google account that was linked to a given country.
