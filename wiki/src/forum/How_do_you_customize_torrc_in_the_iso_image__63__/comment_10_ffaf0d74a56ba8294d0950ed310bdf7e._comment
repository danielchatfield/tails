Where did you get this impression? `AllowSingleHopCircuits` is implicitly disabled in Tails since we're using Tor's default. Sure, single hop circuits are still made for directory fetches (see `TunnelDirConns`) but that is not an issue since directory data is signed (prevents forgery) and time stamped (prevents replay). Perhaps you've seen these in Vidalia's circuit list and simply got confused?

No, this should never happen.
