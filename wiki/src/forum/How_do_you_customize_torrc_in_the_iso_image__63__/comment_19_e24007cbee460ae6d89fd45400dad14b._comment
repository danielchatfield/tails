I know that this thread is now resolved that Tails is using the standard Tor setup with 3 hops and not 1 but i still don't understand in the orginal post about the part that the NSA has requested that Tor to make single hops. ?

Anything the NSA could do with a single hop could be done in any country so it doesn't make any sense. ?
