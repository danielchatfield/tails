@ comment 15:
> Is directory fetches when Tor asks for a list of Entry Nodes for the user to connect to ?

A directory fetch updates your Tor client's list of all relays/nodes in the Tor network, and their properties (can it be an Entry/Guard node? can it be an Exit? how much bandwidth does it offer? etc.). To get a picture of what information a directory fetch exactly contains, have a look at the files in `/var/lib/tor` (requires superuser privileges), or look at [TorStatus](http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/) for a more human-readable representation.

Case closed then.

I assure you that given how torrc is parsed by Tor there's no difference between adding `AllowSingleHopCircuits 0` and just doing nothing.
