If you want to connect to the same entry node each time then start Tails in Bridge mode.  Query for a list of bridges and, each time you start Tails, use the Bridge option at the command line. 
When Tails starts it then waits for you to enter the IP address/port number of these bridges.  That way your first-hop connection to the Tor network is always the same.
