Regarding:
    \"Tails allows single hops. [...] This requres a change in torrc.

Where did you get this impression? AllowSingleHopCircuits is implicitly disabled in Tails since we're using Tor's default. Sure, single hop circuits are still made for directory fetches (see TunnelDirConns) but that is not an issue since directory data is signed (prevents forgery) and time stamped (prevents replay). Perhaps you've seen these in Vidalia's circuit list and simply got confused?\"

I can actually see open single node circuits live in the \"View the Network\" open circuit listings. I have to force close them and only allow three node circuits. Torbundle default allows single hops by default.  I always had to change torrc to force disallow single hop circuits for Torbundle. Tails torrc should be hardcoded to three hops. That would not adverseley affect the \"global anonymity set\" and would increase user anonymity versus the risk of a hacker or government controlled node assuming ownership of a users single hop circuit. As I said, NSA WAS petitioning the tor staff for single hop fucnitionality.
