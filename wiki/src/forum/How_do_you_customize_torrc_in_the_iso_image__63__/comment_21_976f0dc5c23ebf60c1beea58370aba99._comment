You make a good point.

Why would a body like the NSA if it's true make a public request for a single node circuit instead of all the traffic going via 3 nodes to totally screw anonyminity to put agents at risk and allow repressive goverments access to Tor information.

Makes as little sense and reason as <hack China> idiotic reply.

Sounds like Tor forum scaremongering.
