It is a silly advice to build a whole distro to change one runtime configuration file. 
The Tails developer should openly say so if he does not want people to change the torrc. 
This reluctance to let people effectively change their torrc shows the developer has not understood how Tor was meant to work from its historical roots. 
Navy's entry node was always secure because it was their relay. 
The responding site and exit node should not know that it was the Navy looking at the responding site. 
So at least one proxy in between was needed. 

Transplanting the onion routing for general use was artificial and made it less secure than in its original setting. 
Because onion routing is based on the the principle that the first relay is under your control, secure and friendly. 
From that the Navy could not care less about traffic analysis. 

In contrast you now have a lottery with unknown chances to get one of the foul entry guards. 
The only way to better the chances for the individual user is to tweak his torrc to exclude the obviously bad candidates for a circuit.
