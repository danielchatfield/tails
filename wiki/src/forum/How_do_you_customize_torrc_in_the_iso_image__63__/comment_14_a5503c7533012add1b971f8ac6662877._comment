No. Tails' Tor is doing the exact same thing as any default Tor installation, which is forcing circuits to use exactly three hops. The only exception to this is that one-hop circuits are used for directory fetches (which has nothing to do with the traffic Tor anonymizes, and is completely safe and uncontroversial). That is also default Tor behaviour.

@ comment 13:

The OP is wrong.
