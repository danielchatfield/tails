>So did you spot the problem?

I spotted **two**!..

1. If you configure your home computer as a SSH server, it'll be (demonstrably) configured as a SSH server. Not convinced this really constitutes a problem.

2. Interminable diatribes spamming the Tails forum with nothing but the occasional tenuous contrived references to Tails to make them in any way Tails specific.

Do I win a prize?
