The defining characteristic of Tails is that it tries to provide an *amnesiac* operating system.  That is, it provides a live DVD system which leaves no traces of activity while using Tails once the system is rebooted from the hard drive.  Furthermore, Tails provides ready to use Tor, together with a firewall configured to minimize the chances of accidental de-anonymizing leaks of information by the Tails system while it is in use, as well as the metadata anonymization toolkit (mat).

For these reasons, Tails is perfectly suited to meet the needs of anyone preparing to leak an important document in the public interest.  Furthermore, some of us feel that any explanation of some practical Tails skills which people can use Tails to help others (and/or improve their own lives) is a topic of discussion suitable for the Tails forum.

Some of us have argued that strong cryptography and anonymity have never been more important for reporters and their sources.  Three major stories have recently broken which underscore this point:

First, the AP wire service revealed last Friday that it had just been informed by a letter from a DA that during April and May 2012 the DOJ tapped more than 20 phone lines associated with the AP, including 

* the office and home phones of at least five reporters and editors
* the main switchboard line of the AP

See

    http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe

Presumably this was done after obtaining a secret warrant from the FISA court, in which case the DOJ would have argued that such intrusions were \"necessary\" to avoid some supposedly existential threat to the USA.  

The working assumption so far is that the real reason was to discover who leaked to the targeted AP reporters some information about an alleged new type of bomb which cannot be easily detected by current airport pervscanners.  Supposedly, the AP story which revealed US fears that such a bomb might exist endangered an informant who had infiltrated a terror group and had volunteered himself as a suicide bomber, in an effort to find out whether the alleged bomb even exists, and if so to bring back a working copy so that the USG can learn how to make them.  (And maybe even some way to detect them.)

It appears that all outgoing calls, and probably all incoming calls also, were logged.  (There are some technical and legal differences between how the FBI logs ingoing/outgoing calls versus recording and transcribing the contents of the calls.  It is not yet clear exactly what techniques the FBI used in this case.)  Applicable US law appears not to have been followed; to mention just one problem, it appears that it was illegal for the DOJ to wait so long before informing the AP about the taps (unless they continued far past May 2012, with the approval of the FISA court).

This disclosure immediately led to a remarkably unified expression of revulsion and dismay from both left and right wing politicians, as well as from nonpartisan civil liberties groups such as the EFF and CPJ

Second, it was learned that Bloomberg News (an organization which some have praised for its excellent \"Wired for Repression\" series highlighting the abhorrent business practices of surveillance companies like Gamma International) has itself been engaged for years in an apalling and probably illegal practice, in which its reporters were able to track the on-line activities of any client of Bloomberg's signature research accounts.  Since these clients include bankers, people who run hedge funds and other high profile investors, as well as regulating agencies such as the SEC, Bloomberg reporters had a deep window into what people like the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve bank were researching while using Bloomberg's Financial News and Business Week.  

Civil liberties groups such as the ACLU are all too familiar with an unfortunate law of human nature: whenever any group of people have the power to peer deeply into the lives of others, they will abuse this power.  So it was in this case.  For example, it has been revealed that for years it was common practice at Bloomberg for reporters who felt bored during a slow news day to listen to the recorded transcripts of people like Allan Greenspan with techs as Bloomberg's call centers, just so they could laugh at Greenspan fumbling with some unfamiliar on-line search tool.

In the Bloomberg Scandal, the victims were Bloomberg clients who were legitimately logged in to their personal or organizational Bloomberg accounts; the ill effects of the years of illicit snooping by Bloomberg financial news reporters could have been mitigated had they used Tor with Ixquick and other \"anonymized\" search engines whenever possible.

Third, Heise Security revealed Skype (which is now owned by Microsoft) not only reads the contents of Skype calls but records sensitive login names and passwords:

      http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Skype-with-care-Microsoft-is-reading-everything-you-write-1862870.html

Microsoft claims that it does this in order to prevent fraud, in a kind of corporate version of the increasingly wearisome Orwellian newspeak from government spokepersons who respond to concerns about prosecutorial over-reach: ''we are doing all this for your own protection''.

All three stories support our thesis in this thread, that both reporters and leakers should use strong cryptography and anonymizing tools like Tails to the maximal extent possible, whenever possible.  Indeed, to reporters the Tails community should say: *if you are not doing these things, you are not properly performing your job*.

I would go further and state using Tails should be taught to in the lower forms, rather as children are taught to cross streets with appropriate caution.

These ideas are ``in the air'', because they are really so obvious to anyone who has a good think about the current state of our global society.  Indeed, in the Threat Level blog, Nicholas Weaver has just published an essay, \"How to Leak\"

     http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/05/listen-up-future-deep-throats-this-is-how-to-leak-to-the-press-today/

in which he addresses the same question discussed here:

> So how can one safely leak information to the press?

While Weaver does not mention Tails, he opens with the same basic claim which some of us have made in this forum for quite some time:

> We now live in a world where public servants informing the public about government behavior or wrongdoing must practice the tradecraft of drug dealers and spies. Otherwise, these informants could get caught in the web of administrations that view George Orwell’s 1984 as an operations manual... it is clear that whether Democrat or Republican, we now live in a surveillance dystopia beyond Orwell’s Big Brother vision. Even privately collected data isn’t immune, and some highly sensitive data is particularly vulnerable thanks to the Third Party Doctrine.

A fourth notable news story provides another example of how *not* to leak, and also provides further support for the claim some of us have made here, that it is currently almost impossible to use email anonymously.

As we all recall, last year Gen. David Petraeus was forced out as head of the CIA after it was revealed that he had not only carried on an affair with a younger woman but had used a very silly technique to communicate with her (they used a shared \"secret\" email account registered under a pseudonym and instead of sending email, left messages in the \"drafts\" folder).   And a few days ago, a CIA officer working under diplomatic cover in the US Embassy in Moscow (he was nominally Third Secretary, the traditional post for the \"head of station\" for both CIA and FSB officers working in overseas embassies) was apprehended by Russian security forces.  It turned out he was carrying an incriminating letter in which he provided instructions to a prospective spy on how to set up an \"anonymous\" email account in order to keep in touch with his handler.  From

> To contact us again, please open a new Gmail account, which you will use only for communicating with us, in an Internet cafe or a cafe with a WiFi connection. When signing up, do not use any personal information that could be used to identify you and the new account. So do not offer any real contact information, i.e. your telephone numbers or other email addresses.

> If Gmail asks for your personal information, please, start the registration process again and try not to give them any information. After you register the new inbox, send an email to the address unbacggdA(at)gmail.com, and then check the inbox again exactly one week later to see if you have received our reply.

Anyone here who reads this amateurish scheme will surely respond with gales of derisive laughter.  Little wonder that the CIA has been so ineffective in obtaining and \"running\" sources of \"humint\".  

So evidently CIA officers are among those who can benefit from our proposal to discuss \"anonymizing tradecraft\" in this forum.  This would presumably please the National Democratic Institute (sponsor of the Tails Project), as being \"consistent with USG foreign policy objectives.
