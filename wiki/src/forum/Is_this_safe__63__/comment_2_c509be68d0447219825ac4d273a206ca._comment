Sorry if I'm a little behind by not knowing the tech stuff behind computers well but I do think about it/worry about it so I'm trying to learn. Could you or anyone also maybe explain what a mac address even is to me and how its bad and maybe show me to a mac address changer or whatever then? I'm connecting to a network that's unsecured now so am I like too late or something? What's wrong with that? Also is maybe things that connect to the internet in the background on my computer like a paid antivirus lets say giving away my id or whatever too and thus stealing my privacy or whatever?
