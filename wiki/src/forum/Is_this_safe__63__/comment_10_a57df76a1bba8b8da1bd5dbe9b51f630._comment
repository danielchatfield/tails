...err no.

firstly, if you're suffering from paranoia, delving into the subject will only give you more to worry about. Specifically as there is no 100% protection in matters of internet security and anonymity - it just gets deeper and deeper. If your biggest fear is Cancer, reading about it before going to bed every night is not going to make you feel any better is it?

Back to the subject at hand: if you're unwilling or unable to learn about internet privacy or security then there is little to gain by worrying about it - the best solution would be to not use the internet for anything personal what so ever. However, if you can't stand the thought of giving up the internet then the only course of action is to spend time educating yourself in the risks and strategies available until you are comfortable with those risks. For instance, older generations will have more trouble learning about proxies, TOR, firewalls, javascript, linux..... and thus will have more difficulty in finding a happy medium between their concerns and their abilities. However, despite their lacking abilities, their concerns are still no less legitimate than yours. If it's too much effort to learn about this stuff compared to the stress caused by worrying about it then avoiding it all together might be the better solution.

and regarding the Ayn Rand quip, also err no.

If everyone sought a better quality of life there would not automatically be more tyranny injustice or misery. Seeking a better quality of life doesn't mean sticking your head in the sand any more or less than it means rising up and taking a stand. That's a stupid assumption as it will vary between circumstance and individuals. It also does not mean that your better quality of life has to be at the detriment of others'.

Tails does a lot to help people who are not ninjas with computers get some privacy. However it comes with a serious warning on the box saying that it is not 100% safe and that it's ultimately your own responsibility. This can only be really understood with plenty of personal research *and* understanding. While Tails is aiming to be user friendly, the concepts behind it are not. If the user cannot resolve these two factors happily within themselves then they may be better off avoiding the game all together.
