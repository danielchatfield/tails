do your own research - search wikipedia for \"mac address\" and \"mac changer\".

look further down on this forum, there must be a dozen posts refering to mac changing (don't confuse with posts referring to apple mac though). Read them all even if their meaning is not clear.

You should be able to figure it out. If you don't understand a word then look it up. If you cannot do this then the only privacy and security you'll ever attain will be purely psychological and mostly meaningless.

Once you've done those things, come back here with what you've found and then should you still need it, I'll give you some more help.
