Ok I guess I'll do my reasearch then on it but is that the only two things I should worry about then for that situation?? I just need to hear something that I might get a grip and do something about my paranoia. 

Also I was just wondering too about this, would I have to worry about my mac address and all that if I connect to a unsecured wifi hotspot using a router like device such as a wifi enhancer or whatever?
