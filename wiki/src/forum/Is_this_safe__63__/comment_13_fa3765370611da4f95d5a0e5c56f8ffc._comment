Tails already has it built in you say? I am new to tor so I didn't know. So if I just turn on the tor browser (recently downloaded) then it will automatically take care of my mac for me I guess or something? 

All I did was downloaded a more popular or famous mac changer (technitium) and found the NIC or whatever I was using to connect to the internet by wifi (said the one that was active when I was connected to the internet for me) and I clicked randomize and it gave me a random address it seemed that belonged to some existing company or whatever from a random part of the world. I don't know. Nothing technical though. Just followed the simple instructions to how to use the software.


Also just to the side, I was wondering if I needed to worry about my mac address and using a spoofed one on a public computer like at a library or something.
