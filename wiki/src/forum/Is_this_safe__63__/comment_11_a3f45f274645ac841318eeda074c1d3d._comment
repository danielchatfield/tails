I downloaded and tried using a mac changer already on an unsecured network but everytime I did it didn't let me connect and actually stopped the router until I switched my mac address back to its original. I just hit the randomize option because I don't know much about that stuff but I tried it several times and all it did everytime was nothing but mess it up. Why is that? What can I do now?
