If you use an open public connection and you are not on CCTV or physically logged via some kind of access eg. (library card) and you use tails with macchanger you should be anonymous.

however, if you're adversary is a large agency or government with many resources and should you represent a significant and specific target then I don't know if that would be enough though.

for peace of mind, you should research the whole scale of threats and counters (eg. TEMPEST and farraday cages). Then you have to decide where you want to position yourself  on that scale based on the threats which you are most concerned about - that will be somewhere between living your life on facebook logging in via gps where ever you go to living in cave with no contact with the outside world. You cannot protect yourself if the world is after you but if you're not much of a target in the first place, you only have to do a little to make it not worth it for your opponents.

If you're really suffering from paranoia though, then it might just be best to avoid researching any of this and give up on using the internet for anything more than cat pictures. Do whatever improves your quality of life the most.
