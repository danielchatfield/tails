macchanger, in conjunction with ip(8), is a pretty good idea if you're going somewhere besides your home router. At home, it serves nearly no purpose that I can think of.
Example:
Let's take the attacker as FBI looking for child pornographers, common enough.

I make a honeypot and distribute it. I can get one end of the net traffic from there, even from a .onion

I set up equipment at various coffee shops, libraries, and other common public wifi - few complaints from store owners there.

That gives me a nice subset of entry-exit points (not TOR entry nodes, but rather YOUR computer) for my traffic analysis. Cuts down significantly on the overhead. You ping my honeypot (giggity) and I check my database for concurrent, encrypted activity. If I get some, I play some timing delay games to narrow down the specific entry point. Now I retrieve surveillance and MAC addresses from the appropriate public wifi spot. I see you in there at the right time, but can't be sure it's you looking. If I match your MAC address to the one that had encrypted traffic, you're busted.

 Otherwise, you're just one of a dozen people in there. Since the default is your hardware mac, it'd be best practice to randomize it a little before hopping on the network. If you're at home, well, I know who you were anyway.

Mac address persists in logs of wifi you connect to. It links IP and traffic to your computer, best to not let it.

 Problems would arise if you have a mac address based whitelist at home or at work, when changing it would either not allow you to connect, or flag your use.
