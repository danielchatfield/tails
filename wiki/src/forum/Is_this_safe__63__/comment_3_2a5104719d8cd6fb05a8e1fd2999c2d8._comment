Was just wondering if its also safe to download stuff like tails on a unsecured network with my own computer. Also I guess I would save tails to my flash drive but should I put it out in the open or in my security software I have on it and should I maybe put tails on a usb device I'm not using?

Trying to keep it simple to get started on using tails/tor for the first time.
