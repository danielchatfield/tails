>So if I just turn on the tor browser (recently downloaded) then it will automatically take care of my mac for me I guess or something?

Macchanger is not included *Tor Browser Bundle*.

Macchanger is included in *Tails* but needs to be manually activated. Search for instructions.

Unless you know exactly what you are doing and are prepared to assume all risk, Tails as well as Tor Browser Bundle should be used *as they come*; in their *default* configurations. Making changes or adding programs to Tails can negate its very purpose.
