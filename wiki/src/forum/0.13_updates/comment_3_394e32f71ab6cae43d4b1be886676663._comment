>The feature I'd most like to see is a boot option for randomizing MAC addresses on startup.

I'll second that. It'd be a very useful function indeed. I don't think it'd be trivial to achieve though. Macchanger seems more than a bit sketchy and different nics must be treated differently... some must be \"down\" when macchanged, others up but then brought \"down\" then \"up\" again afterwards, for others this would loose the new mac!... etc... etc... It's all a horrible can of worms. If Tails tackled this it'd have to be done perfectly, obviously, or Tails would start slipping into snake-oil realms and I for one would find that much worse than having to run macchanger myself!

Perhaps this'll change once Squeeze is dead and Wheezy becomes stable: Wheezy's network applet has built-in mac spoofing - it's probably comparatively trivial to populate the appropriate fields with a quasi-random mac in Wheezy's applet?
