Typically, I turn off my router before I boot TAILS.

This allows me to set the root password, set the UTC time, and access my hard drive without exposure to the network in order to run a script locally modifying some TAILS files in addition to running the macchanger command:

    macchanger -a eth0

which assures me that my computer's mac address has been changed prior to the DHCP address and lease assigned to my router after my router has been turned on.
