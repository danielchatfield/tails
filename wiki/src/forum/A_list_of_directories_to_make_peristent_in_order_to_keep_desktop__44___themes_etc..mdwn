I am currently using these settings and thought i would share them. To use these goto configure persistence and add them as custom directories.

To keep desktop wallpaper:

/home/amnesia/.gconf/desktop   

To add/edit/remove shortcuts on you desktop:

/home/amnesia/Desktop

To keep installed themes and have them start on load up:

/home/amnesia/.themes

To keep themed icons and have them start on load up:

/home/amnesia/.icons

To keep any changes you make to the panel:

/home/amnesia/.gconf/apps/panel


Thankyou.
