The main thing - is I want to thank the developers for the project burn and updated.
But please you must understand that the "simple user " (80% of whom had not seen Linux, 
and 70% are unaware of the existence of the incoming ports), 
there is no problem in recording *.Iso disk, put it in the palm Coffee, and use the browser&bird&pidguin
But the need to change your password, MAC is nowhere described well, 
ideally at desktop need a program with one button to do so. 
But the top - it's firewall. 
By default, all ports are closed, although the logic of a "LiveCD" is designed to work out of the box. 
MAN absent.
Result - the user has registered ETh0, was unable to run TOR server,
for the sane time, did not find the information and threw the disc in the trash.
