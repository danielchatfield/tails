the message stating that tor needs accurate system time settings to funtion properly finishes with "please wait..." (or something similar). This message will stay in the top right portion of the screen indefinitely or at least until I click on it - is there supposed to be some form of positive outcome or follow up message to this process?

Using tails on wifi, there is never internet connection available just after startup so I wonder if things are working as they should.

thanks
