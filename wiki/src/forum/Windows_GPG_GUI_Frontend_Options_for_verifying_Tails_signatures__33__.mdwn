I've read a couple of posts here where users are having troubles on Windows verifying GPG keys, and often mention the program Kleopatra, which hasn't worked correctly for me when I've used Windows.

Please note these other, probably better options from GPGs official site:

Frontends -
http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/frontends.en.html

listed first on that page is:

Cryptophane -

Please give it and the other GUI frontends a try.
