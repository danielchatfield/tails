I had a great connection for weeks, then I started to get this wierd connection. It says that I'm connected at 1mb or 135mb, but I don't think that's true, because when I have this problem I can't surf using TAILS. I can use TOR in Windows 7 fine (I'm using it now.) I don't think the problem is my router. It has to be with TAILS. Right now I can't upload any error reports, because in TAILS I have too slow a connection (it will just time out.) I'd be happy to help you solve this issue, because it is my issue to, but I don't know a lot about LINUX so I don't think I'd be very helpful.
