For LCD displays the background is *crucial* - perhaps more so than the choice of font! This is probably much more important than just using softened fonts to reduce radio emissions from CRTs. Does anyone even use CRTs any more anyway? ;-)

A good approach to tackling this (much more reliable than an \"anti-tempest font\") could be via filters in the graphics stack. A small reduction in contrast, modest Gaussian blur and the addition of some pixel noise. This could be applied either whole screen or perhaps even to specific windows. A whole screen \"tempest reduction\" (I think that's a good name for this) effect could be toggled by a button on the launcher panel. I'm inclined to think this would be trivial to implement in Compiz but I've no idea what's available in Squeeze.

There's some useful and more contemporary material on this from Markus Kuhn, (also of Cambridge) at <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/>

If you're in a hurry, just grab this: www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/pet2004-fpd.pdf

I'm sure tempest reduction would be an invaluable addition to Tails for many users but please don't just stick in a font and call it done! ;-)
