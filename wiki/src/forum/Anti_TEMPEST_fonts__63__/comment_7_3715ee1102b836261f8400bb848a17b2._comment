\"Sneaky Pete is a java program which lets you input an alphabetic passphrase into a computer without using a keyboard, thus foiling keylogging software/hardware. It also incorporates anti-TEMPEST fonts to make it harder for monitor-scanners to see what letters are on your display.\" - http://packetstormsecurity.org/java/

but it would require java? so, no good, but if the file exists, i didn't try to download it, it should have a set of anti tempest fonts to look at as an example.

while Wine is not a good idea on Tails, try this as an example, offline, for what to look for in fonts and background coloring:

\"install Wine and run a freeware program called, \"Zero Emission Pad\" to modify/read your text documents in, as it claims (strong emphasis on claims) to prevent TEMPEST attacks. It's a Windows only freeware program which I haven't vetted for possible leaks but it is interesting, google for it and you'll eventually find it. At least one software vendor in the U.S. offers a proprietary and commercial application which does the same job, but I have no trust in commercially developed, closed source software, which is a reason why trusting GPG over PGP is a great idea.\"

for those who say, \"snake oil\" or \"bogus info\", you can test this for yourself (and many people who pollute threads on security and/or privacy improvements are shills for government or related organizations) :

TEMPEST-for-eliza - demonstrate electromagnetic 
emissions from computer systems

Offering an anti-TEMPEST Toggle option for all applications and the desktop/icons and one wallpaper incorporating anti-TEMPEST feature in Tails would offer something no other distro offers.

This is something which is overlooked, even in distros like BackTrack, and it really shouldn't be.
