>\"Sneaky Pete is a java program which lets you input an alphabetic passphrase into a computer without using a keyboard, thus foiling keylogging software/hardware. It also incorporates anti-TEMPEST fonts to make it harder for monitor-scanners to see what letters are on your display.\" - http://packetstormsecurity.org/java/

>but it would require java? so, no good, but if the file exists, i didn't try to download it, it should have a set of anti tempest fonts to look at as an example.

We already have Java. It's a dependency of the insanely bloated office suite.

>while Wine is not a good idea on Tails, try this as an example, offline, for what to look for in fonts and background coloring:

>\"install Wine and run a freeware program called, \"Zero Emission Pad\" to modify/read your text documents in, as it claims (strong emphasis on claims) to prevent TEMPEST attacks. It's a Windows only freeware program which I haven't vetted for possible leaks but it is interesting, google for it and you'll eventually find it. At least one software vendor in the U.S. offers a proprietary and commercial application which does the same job, but I have no trust in commercially developed, closed source software, which is a reason why trusting GPG over PGP is a great idea.\" - http://cryptome.org/0005/tor-opsec.htm

Indeed. I remember McAfee provided something like this too. Not sure how useful they are as illustrations though. The papers above seem to provide a very compelling of the risks as well as some simple yet eloquent demonstrations of workable mitigations.

>for those who say, \"snake oil\" or \"bogus info\", you can test this for yourself (and many people who pollute threads on security and/or privacy improvements are shills for government or related organizations) :

>TEMPEST-for-eliza - demonstrate electromagnetic emissions from computer systems - http://www.erikyyy.de/tempest/

I'm pretty sure the \"snake oil\" comment referred to possible solutions. Rather than the threat its-self. At least as I read (and just re-read) it. As has already been suggested, care should be taken to avoid haphazardly slapping in a partial solution and then \"bogusly\" proclaiming Tails to be \"Tempest-proof\". For example, installing a soft font which *may* help reduce vulnerability to *some* CRT attacks, while doing *nothing* to protect LCD users could probably be called \"snake-oil\" or \"bogus\" if most Tails users were using LCDs.

>Offering an anti-TEMPEST Toggle option for all applications and the desktop/icons and one wallpaper incorporating anti-TEMPEST feature in Tails would offer something no other distro offers.

I *loved* the sound of this too. I don't even see any need for a special wallpaper or text background. If the softening and noise were added mindlessly to the whole screen everything would be taken care of in one simple, toggle-able step. Brilliant!

>This is something which is overlooked, even in distros like BackTrack, and it really shouldn't be.

Yes, I completely agree. This problem is precisely Tails' niche and an elegant and innovative solution where none seems to exist anywhere in the public Linux world could really set Tails apart.
