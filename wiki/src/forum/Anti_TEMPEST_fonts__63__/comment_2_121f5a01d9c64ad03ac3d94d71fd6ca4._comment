Unfortunately, I believe this is an altogether more sophisticated problem than *bung in the \"anti-tempest font\".*

As far as I'm aware there's no such thing! A tempest resistant text display would, at the very least, involve a specially crafted *bitmap* font presented over a an appropriate specially crafted tempest-resistant background, ideally by a purpose-designed tempest-resistant rendering engine.

So this is more a *Tails should include an anti-tempest text display application* problem. Does anyone know if such a thing exists in Debian?
