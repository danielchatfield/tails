I use amnesia on USB and when I use firepgp I can export public key but I can't export secret key and when i use again USB I will not be able to use the same keys than i will have to create new ones. I tried with next command:
amnesia@amnesia:~$ gpg --export-secret-keys > /home/amnesia/Desktop/seckey.asc
amnesia@amnesia:~$ gpg --export-secret-keys > /home/amnesia/Desktop/seckey.pem

but after files are created I can't open to check is it my private key. I wanted to use it for privacybox.de but I am not sure I will succeed, they demand PEM file.
