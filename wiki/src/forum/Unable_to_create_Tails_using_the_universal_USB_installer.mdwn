I just downloaded this new version of TAILS. I manually installed the version (Windows) onto a thumb drive and tried to use the Tails USB installer in order to install a permanent encrypted version with a persistent volume on a second thumb drive. This all was in accordance with the instructions. However every time I run the installer, hit the "clone and install" button nothing happens. The program just shut down. The manually installed version seems to be working fine except for this issue, but I haven't really put it through it's paces. I am a first time tails user of course otherwise I would be upgrading.

Any suggestions or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
