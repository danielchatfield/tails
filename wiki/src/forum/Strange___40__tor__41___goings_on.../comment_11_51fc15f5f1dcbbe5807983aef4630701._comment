As I understand it when you run apt-get update you receive a Release
file signed with the Debian key. This contains an MD5 sum of
Packages.gz which in turn contains MD5 sums for all the packages that
are available for updating or downloading.

Then you download the packages and an MD5 sum is generated for each.

The signature of the release file is then checked and the MD5 sum that
it contains is used to check the integrity of the Packages.gz file
and, if okay, the MD5 sums are used to compare against the checksums
of the downloaded packages. If the sums don't match the packages are
not installed.

Whether or not you are correct in your assertion that anybody can fake
a domain and maintain a fake repo of trojanned binaries I don't think
anybody could fake the Debian signature. I hope I'm right about that.
