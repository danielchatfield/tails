Right *now*, fully upgrading a Tails 0.13 or 0.14~rc1 using APT results in a weird iceweasel + torbutton combination that is *much worse*, anonymity -wise, than the web browser included in released Tails versions (basically, torbutton JavaScript hooks are disabled in the resulting browser).

This is a sad, but useful example of how an APT upgrade can break your anonymity,
and is therefore generally discouraged by us: use at your own risks, as they say.
