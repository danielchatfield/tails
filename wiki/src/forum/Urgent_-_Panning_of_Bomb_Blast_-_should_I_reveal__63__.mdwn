Sir, this is most urgent. While traveling down to my city 4 days ago, I overheard the conversation in which two unknown people were planning to plant bombs at a certain place in the month of June 2013. They did not know that I was overhearing their conversation while in sleeper above their bus seat.

but the problem is that in my country if this news turns out to be fake, the informer is tracked and prosecuted for the charge of sending hoaz call and such such offenses. i am in a dilemma as to whether I should inform the law enforcement agencies or should I ignore it and live peacefully in life.

Can I use TAILS with a sense of security to send an email to Investigation agencies?
