I prefer a KISS (keep it simple stupid) kind of Tails. Every layer you add to a system adds increased security risks. Especially in stressful situations users should not be bothered with additional settings, or fall back procedures if \"system x\" does not work.

VPN and SSH seem a valuable asset to branches of - say - multinational companies. They have one serious flaw, they are static. Static means easy to detect, locate, analyze. You might reconsider the use of VPN ? SSH if you want to be anonymous.

VPNs's do raise eyebrows for some users. There seem to be issues with VPN / SSH connections if you try to exit \"certain countries\". Within 10 minutes or so, the VPN / SSH host in the \"safe\" country is probed, attempted to connect to from ip addresses inside \"certain country\".

There are documented cases where VPN logs have been used in court to convict people. A VPN is valuable evidence, since it has legal proof of origin, destination and content.

Some VPN services like UltraSurf seemed to have compromized the operatives inside \"certain countries\". It may be related that their protocol can be (easy) detected by netfilters.
