OK, I understand, in fact I'm already quite happy with Tails as it is now.

Just wondering, though : doesn't the Tor project document (with code diffs) how they patch the firefox sources, and in that case, couldn't you \"simply\" apply these when you build the Tails ISO ?

Otherwise, has anybody discussed what we're missing in terms of anonymity/security by not using the TBB ?
