Hi, I got possibility from email provider to download certificates for vpn secure communication and when I download it, their read me file says something what I can't succeed to do, so how to install openvpn? by the way, why I never succeed to use synaptic? it is in menu but nio possibility to install new software. 

here is their read me file:

Linux (without NetworkManager)
------------------------------

- Install OpenVPN, i.e. on a Debian-based system::

    $ sudo apt-get install openvpn

- Start the VPN connection by pointing openvpn at your config (the file
  named openvpn-ai.conf in the same directory as this README)::

    $ sudo openvpn --config openvpn-466c2b55-023e-4d15-9e3f-e7c7791976ed.conf


Linux (with NetworkManager)
---------------------------

If you are using NetworkManager to configure your network connections,
you are probably better off having it deal with OpenVPN itself.  A
NetworkManager plugin exists for this purpose::

    $ sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome

You can then configure the VPN using NetworkManager itself, use
"Certificates (TLS)" as the Authentication Type, and use the
certificates contained in this ZIP file.

here is what I get:

sudo apt-get install openvpn

sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn-gnome

Package network-manager-openvpn-gnome is not available, but is referred to by another package.

This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'network-manager-openvpn-gnome' has no installation candidate
