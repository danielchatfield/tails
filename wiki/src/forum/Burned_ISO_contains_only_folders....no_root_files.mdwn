Ok I may be an idiot, but I have downloaded the .13 ISO, on my Win 7 machine, and using 2 different methods, burned the image to both a DVD and a USB drive.  In both cases, all that resulted was a successful burn but with only 4 folders,,Disk, [BOOT], isolinux and live.... no individual files in the root location whatsoever.  Documentation indicates there should be many more files.  It of course doesn't boot, since files are missing.   I downloaded the ISO twice, same result.   Thoughts?
