IIRC cryptsetup or dmsetup can give you such information, but I'm not aware of any GUI that does.

However, in case you want to gather this info to pass it to FreeOTFE, I doubt this information will be of any practical use: I doubt a piece of software that cannot read it itself will do anything good with the info passed by hand.
