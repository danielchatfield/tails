There are security concerns in everything and if your life is at risk, you cannot be too paranoid.

Most hardware contain some kind of unique serial number, and TVs and other external displays are no exception. The computer can query it using EDID (Extended display identification data). I don't think it is any worse than e.g. USB thumbdrives, ethernet cards, computer motherboards, etc. that also have serial numbers, but a large TV is quite difficult to hide. Also, like you said, I would not trust any \"SMART televisions\" that have storage capacity and perhaps even it's own internet connectivity.

Of course the serial numbers matters only if your computer running Tails is owned and the attacker is able to gather information about the hardware. Then I would worry mostly about WIFI - once you are able to listen to nearby base stations, it is - thanks to Google - trivil to geolocate you.
