> I keep trying unar - extract xyz.rar and I keep getting:

Are you literally typing \"unar - extract\" if so that's your issue right there, with unar you don't need to specify anything beyond the file you want to extract.

In other words if you want to extract a file named abc.rar located in the same folder you are currently in, in the terminal then all you need to type is \"unar abc.rar\" and it will extract the file.
