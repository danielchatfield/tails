When I surf with Iceweasel to www.stayinvisible.com I get the following results for the level of my surfing privacy regarding to my browser:

User Agent

Now, has every Tails user these same details?
After each restarting of Tails OS the name "Gecko/20100101" stays the same? Or is this unique for my Tails USB?

And also www.stayinvisible.com says that there is a Shockwave Flash plugin. What does this mean? Is this normal? Because Flash can unmask a TOR ip.

And how important is it to change the hostname of Tails? And how can it be done?

Wanna thank everyone in advance!
