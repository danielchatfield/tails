Technically possible, but then, do you really trust your BIOS so much? Your CDROM drive? Your network adapter? CPU? Graphics card? Technically, every component of your computer the data passes through may deliberately alter the data.

Therefore, you can never be sure your computer is secure unless you manufacture all the components yourself and assemble it with your own hands. And even then you should burn the blueprints (in case They can find a vulnerability), never let it out of your sight (in case They plant one of their little spy chips) and never sleep (just in case They can do it while you are asleep).

Even the T(A)ILS - how do you know there isn't some secret spying code introduced 8 years ago by FBI into the vesa graphics driver code? How do you know you can trust T(A)ILS developers? How do you know you can trust their ISP? How do you know you can trust their hashing software to not have hash collisions with malicious software version?

I've been thinking like you for quite a long time. Then, I read a text that opened my eyes, I don't remember the name or the content, but one thing I will never forget - think probability, not possibility. It might be possible that someone added cyanide or arsenic to your coffee or installed a bomb in your car. It's possible, but is it PROBABLE?

Unless you have a big, dangerous enemy with immense surveillance and technological power, you might as well stop worrying. However, keep in mind that you should run T(A)ILS as low-level as your hardware permits (eg, boot from CD/write-protected USB). This will discourage most people and/or governments from trying to spy on you / trick you into thinking you are safe from them.

I can think of many more examples, but I won't list them here, I haven't got 3 hours :) You may feel you are paranoid, but there's paranoid and then there is tinfoil-hat crazy paranoid. Just relax, as long as you don't do anything silly, They don't consider you any danger, that's assuming they even know about you. Firmware-level surveillance and/or manipulation is hard to do in 512 kb ROM :) Stick to common sense, tell an IT expert relative to take a look at the computer to see if there is anything suspicious.

TL;DR - unless you have really dangerous enemies that have full power to do anything they want, you are safe. Just follow common sense and security guidelines.
