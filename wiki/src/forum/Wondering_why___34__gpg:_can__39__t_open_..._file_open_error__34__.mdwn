I'm a common user, a chronic linux newbie --- on Linux Mint 10.  Following directions for linux command line at 

<https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#verify>

all went well until final step "verify" and I got 

    gpg:can't open 'tails-i386-0.iso.pgp' 
    gpg:verify signatures failed: file open error

It's no doubt a simple failure on my part as I'm nothing more than a common point-and-click-read-instructions user, but if it happened to me, maybe to others?  Is it maybe worth mentioning in the doc?

Ultimately I used firefox addon mentioned for "other os" to check hash, and that seems to have done the trick.
