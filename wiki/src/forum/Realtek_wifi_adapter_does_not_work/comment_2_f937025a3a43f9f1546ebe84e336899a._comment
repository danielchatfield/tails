RTL8192 and RTL8192se are different hardware, and need different
firmware and drivers to work.

Debian bugs
[#609784](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=609784) and
[#590280](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=590280)
allow tracking progress of efforts being made to have Debian support
the RTL8192se wireless interface. See also the [upstream kernel bug
report](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29532).

[A Ubuntu
bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/401126)
shows people using the driver provided by Realtek have various results.
