It's wonderful what you Tails developers already do by maintaining Tails. I certainly wouldn't want to ask any more of you than that. 

But having a decent place to talk about Tor security, since Tails IS partly Tor, is such an important unmet need that greatly concerns Tails users. I wish there can be some solution without causing you devs more work.

Could you maybe just skip over more of the threads? Or even let a trusted user moderate?
