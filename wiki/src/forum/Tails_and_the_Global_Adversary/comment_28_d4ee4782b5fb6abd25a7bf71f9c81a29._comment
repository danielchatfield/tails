Widely available OTR versions are currently restricted to
inter-individual conversation, and I don't think \"talking to *one*
other Tails developer at a time\" is a viable way to participate in the
community on the long run, so I don't think we'll spend time making
this possible. Sorry about that. Anyway, the huge majority of the work
that happens on Tails is done in public spaces, so I fail to see how
the unavailability of private chat would be much of an issue
in practice.

> and have been unable to master anonymous email,

I'm sorry about this. If it may help, long-term anonymous email with
Tor is a topic that's addressed every now and then on tor-talk.

I've just answered this in another thread that was hijacked with the
same question.
