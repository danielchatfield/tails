Yes.

Clearly there is no global passive adversary able to monitor *all* traffic between (or within) all networks in the world.  But the list of 38 operators in the other thread 

     https://tails.boum.org/forum/Who_carries_half_of_all_Tor_traffic__63____38_operators/

clearly shows that the biggest Tor nodes are geolocated in either the USA or SE, DE, GB, NL and other American allies.  It is known that the intelligence agencies of all these countries cooperate, and the USA and GB in particular *automatically* share vast amounts of secretly snarfed data.

Even worse, all of these countries are passing increasingly oppressive legislation under which governments can secretly demand metadata, copies of data streams and communications, even to interfere at will with data (for example by inserting packets or otherwise preventing users from receiving some emails or other data).  All follow the American type model of private ISPs subjected to mandatory government intrusions. Nevertheless, the internet laws of EU nations remain significantly different from each other and from the US.  And some countries are remain reluctant to share some of their intelligence with other American allies.

I should probably also point out that bad as this is, it may be better than the actions of the governments of RU, CN, IR and some others which have been able to largely prevent their own citizens from participating in Tor as much as they would like.  (For example, the number of Tor nodes in RU dropped off after the latest repressive internet law came into effect.)  But if Tor users operate under a mistaken impression about what Tor can and cannot do for them, that is potentially even more hazardous than not being able to easily access Tor at all.  (Unless this drives them to do something even more hazardous, in attempting to communicate dissenting views with like-minded citizens.)

It is quite possible that certain governments are \"flying under the radar\" by operating large numbers of Tor Exit nodes in other countries, using many different ISPs and posing as ordinary citizens.

However, reams of leaked white papers and marketing documents from the surveillance firms which these governments hire to do much of their dirty work suggests that most governments with global intelligence ambitions use the infrastructure of their general purpose national scale universal network surveillance (or international in the case of the US and some others), not Tor nodes themselves, to monitor Tor traffic.  Don't forget that many nations have the ability to at least attempt national level MITM attacks which potentially strip the SSL \"protection\" from all tor data streams traversing their national wires.

One point of interest is that because some of the highest bandwidth nodes now operate in the cloud or use satellite circuits, the USA in particular has increased opportunity to snoop on more Tor traffic using existing global surveillance infrastructure.

Another interesting point is that some nations clandestinely intrude into the vast \"Five Eyes\" surveillance network and databases in order to feed their own intelligence services with information.  The US doesn't like to talk about that very much, but they know this happens and can't to very much about it.  Far too many people have access to prevent this from happening.  All they can do is run around like maniacs administering more and more intrusive lie detector tests to and intruding further and further into the daily lives of their own employees, searching for tiny clues to possible \"financial irregularities\" or evidence of clandestine communication with rival agencies.

See also the story from December 2012 about a huge leak from the secret police of a small EU country which just happens to host a large number of fast Tor nodes (apparently operated by NGOs outside that country, but still, their laws mandate extensive government surveillance of the national wires).

I believe that traffic padding is promising, but this will require a larger and higher capacity Tor network.  I believe the answer may lie in a mixture of lowering the boundaries for ordinary people wishing to operate a non-Exit nodes, and in trying to find additional NGOs untainted by ties to surveillance companies who are willing to operate high bandwidth Exit routers.  Many of us would be willing to contribute financially but of course it is getting harder and harder to do this anonymously, and simply trying to use anonymous payment systems is likely to get us placed on some pretty nasty lists.
