That's a brilliant analyze. My personal view is that no matter how hard the Free People will try to code around the Superstate... we just can't beat it on its own infrastructure. Why:

- In the IEEE sit people from the Superstate, hence the communication protocols are made in mind with \"legal\" tracing or even eavesdropping, we have evidence for that
- The hardware leaves fingerprints all the time - should it be on purpose or not. The same for software
- Not talking about all possible side attacks

Cracking any encryption will always be only a question of time. They have the technology to record everything now, and analyze later. As we speak, our encrypted emails from the 90's are probably in plain text, fed into intelligence software.

Therefore the people have to start expanding and building independent networks, based on free hardware. There are good examples out there. 

In the mean time we have to make our fellow co-citizens aware of the dimension of sh*t we stand in, to act against our states turning into a global prison.

It won't be easy but we have to try.
