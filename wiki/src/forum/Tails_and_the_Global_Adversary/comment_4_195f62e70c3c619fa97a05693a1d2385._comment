@2 Agree, also. But it appears Onion Router version 2 doesn't even TRY to do much about \"global adversary\" level big government and it's ever increasing encroachment on civil liberties and the free internet.

I think it's time to start working on Onion Router version 3 with a high-security option to not even worry about the low latency stuff and just do what it takes to keep the internet free, even from \"global adversaries\", high latency, padding, and all. Whatever it takes.
