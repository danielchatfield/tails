Erm... no you're not. The *fact* that OT discussions are unhelpful and therefore unwelcome here has *nothing* to do with \"complaints from other users to yourself about political/legal/technical discussions they dislike\". Have a look around previous threads... e.g. try a quick search for \"have the resources\".

Full marks for hypocrisy though... this relentless raising and badgering re. random \"political/legal/technical discussions\" is actually the absolute antithesis of \"sympathetic to the problem of developer overload\"! Any chance you could put a sock in the the disingenuous, manipulative, sycophantic rhetoric? (and thus lighten \"the problem of developer overload.\")
