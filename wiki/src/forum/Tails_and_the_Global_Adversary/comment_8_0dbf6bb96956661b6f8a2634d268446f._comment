From a thread in Tor-Talk:

     https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-January/027166.html

Question:

> Can anyone tell me what mechanisms we (or the Tor Project members)
have in scanning for malicious exit nodes. Such as nodes that are
manipulating DNS requests, stripping SSL, etc. I know of the SOAT
project from Mike Perry but the last I heard there was a GSOC dev
working on the project. Is that still being used?

Reply:

> In theory there are SoaT scanners running and sending their
reports to...

     https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-exitscanner

> ... but that hasn't been maintained in quite some time. The last
report to tor-exitscanner@ was on 6/9/12 and as I understand it SoaT
needs a lot of love. In addition to that our process for giving relays
a BadExit flag even after they're reported is really poor, requiring
manual intervention by three extremely busy people.

> Like many of our spaces the trouble is that there's no one presently
dedicated to making it better. It looks like a fun area (I've been
tempted to write a SoaT counterpart for years) but lack the bandwidth.
