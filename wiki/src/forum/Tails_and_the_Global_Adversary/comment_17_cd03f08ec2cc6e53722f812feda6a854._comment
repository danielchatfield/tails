First, thanks *a lot* for coming up with actual proposals!

> Could you maybe just skip over more of the threads?

This would be great and simple and all, but unfortunately it is not an option: there's occasionally very distasteful stuff written / links pasted here, that we absolutely don't want to host. Also, dangerous suggestions are regularly made, and I feel it's our duty to at the very least debunk the wost of it.

> Or even let a trusted user moderate?

I'd be glad if a team of volunteers showed up and we progressively built a trust relationships :)
