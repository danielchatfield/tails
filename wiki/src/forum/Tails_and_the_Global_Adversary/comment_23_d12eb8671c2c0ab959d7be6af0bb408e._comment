@ \"Tails\":

Thank you for agreeing that education is the answer.

I am actually quite sympathetic to the problem of developer overload, lack of full time moderator, and complaints from other users to yourself about political/legal/technical discussions they dislike, and I agree that at least in the short term the best response is to encourage organizations like the EFF and Tor Project to create a forum like this one, in which unregistered users can post on Tor-related topics, including the big picture of legal/social/technical developments which may affect an optimized threat model for Tor.

Since you (the Tails developers) apparently can reach the Tor developers, but I have been unable to, I hope you will take the time to shoot them a message informing them of the problem here and the suggested solution.  I don't deny that such a forum would probably become a bit of a nightmare to moderate, and will probably attract takedown threats from angry surveillance company CEOs, but it ought to be completely obvious that existing Tor fora do not allow the Tor user base to discuss issues of interest to the user base, or to provide sufficient feedback to the Tor developers.
