Fully agreed :)

Absolutely not, as we have repeatedly said. It's a bit harsh to throw work on other people, when they have explicitly and repeatedly said they did not want to do it, you know.

I do realize the \"more relevant\" place *sometimes* may not exist yet, but I don't think it's our responsibility to cope with the fact nobody has created such a place yet.

Please do realize that someone, such as us Tails developers, have something to say about what they're happy to take care of, spend time on, and maintain. I'm sorry, but we don't owe anyone anything we don't have commited to, and we certainly have never commited ourselves to maintain a general purpose forum about privacy and anonymity.
