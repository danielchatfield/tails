This leads nowhere. Tor messed up big time. They failed for years to use stronger encryption keys.

Its always the same with projects. When they are new they start great but then get worse and worse.

If you want stronger protection dont waste time waiting for Tor. Dont waste time waiting for forum. You may get the forum but thats about it. Dont expect big improvements.

Someone else should do it wont work. Take the Tor codebase and make it better or be happy with what you get for free. End of story.
