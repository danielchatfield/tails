> I'd be glad if a team of volunteers showed up 

I have previously expressed an interest in acting in some non-developer volunteer role.  Since I know a good deal about what has been published in mainstream media and whistleblower sites about state-sponsored attacks and miscellaneous security flaws, I could probably take a stab at trying to organize, summarize, and explain all that vast amount of material for the benefit of ordinary Tails users.

Comment 25 suggests that some Tails users would evidently be very unhappy to see such a development, but not surprisingly, I think that view should be subordinated to the needs of the userbase.

> and we progressively built a trust relationship

A good start would be:

* acknowledge that some have been unable to find Tails developers in the chat rooms (using otr chat), and have been unable to master anonymous email, and give in and *simply tell us* (please?) where, how and when to reach you via otr chat, in sufficient detail for us to reach you
* clarify the mysterious identity/nature of \"Sponsor Alfa\", \"Sponsor Bravo\"; if as someone just claimed in another thread the unknown corporate sponsor of Tails is The Sony Corporation, that could certainly be an obstacle building a trust relationship, because (if it's true), that would be a serious conflict of interest, and not disclosing it a serious moral breach, Maslow or not.

Commentator 25 has just called me a liar and a sycophant (LOL), but I think you realize that I sincerely want to help, and that I can guess how much time pressure the core developers are under, and what morale problems you face.
