Not at all.  Education is the answer, and I think this is the place, at least until the Tor Project starts a similar forum.

If every worried question from a newbie, or still worse from an experienced Tor user, is met with an absurd response such as:

* move the discussion to a (nonexistent) alternative forum
* immediately learn as much as Roger D knows about how Tor works
* the pursuit of privacy is merely quixotic

then this would foster the impressions (mistaken, I believe) that 

* no-one is replying with the answer because no-one knows the answer
* the Tor Project is just another US government conspiracy

It can certainly be appropriate to ask people to read the Tails documentation, or a particular Tor-talk post (especially if you offer a link), or a particular paper in the Freehaven.net archive

     http://freehaven.net/anonbib/topic.html#Anonymous_20communication

I myself have at times offered such recommendations.  But it can also be appropriate for more experience Tor users to try to help newbies, as per 

     https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/help/

Some posters here have a deep aversion to recognizing an unpleasant but essential truth: *the most likely cause of harm to Tails users comes not from a software bug but from misunderstanding the methods, motivations, and intentions of our adversaries*.  Explaining these involves holding political, legal, and technical discussions the Surveillance Industrial complex very much wants to prevent us from pursuing.
