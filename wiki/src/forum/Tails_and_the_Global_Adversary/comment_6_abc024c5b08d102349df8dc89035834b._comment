One clue to measures which hold particular promise to protect The People against the ever more intrusive Surveillance State comes from leaked white papers which explain which innovations most worry the operators of the Surveillance State in its current form.

One which stands out is the advent of Linux radio.  Small cheap computers like the Raspberry Pi can potentially be adapted to run programmable radio emitters/receivers, ultimately creating local \"citizen intranets\" which do not use the corporate wires at all, and thus simply evade much of the existing surveillance infrastructure.  (Most governments have plenty of radio scanners, but these are not integrated into their internet surveillance infrastructure.

Citizen activists are also increasingly taking advantage of another emerging technology (ironically, popular with the most lethal government in human history for the elimination of adult males in poor areas, people by whose continued existence this government feels threatened): drones. Small citizen operated drones offer much promise for integration into citizen intranets.  I believe that the Raspberry Pi is light enough to be carried by home consumer drone devices.
