Is the current infrastructure sufficient to support this? Might one \"built a trust relationship\" by simply creating an account/identity here and posting via that, rather than anonymously? Perhaps earning access to a \"*Comment by **[Moderator#3](https://tails.boum.org/ikiwiki.cgi?page=Moderators&do=goto)** *\" style account?

Not that I'm advocating the idea.. I personally think it'd be terrible and the puffed up tinpot-despots who often strut around other projects are a curse we're very fortunate to have escaped here.
