Mailing lists are not suitable for communicating with the user base of an anonymity-promoting tool.  The Tor Project must recognize this and create a forum like this one, which allows posts from unregistered users. which uses https, and is in general Tor-friendly.

Instead of yelling at me, why not use your favorite Mailing list to advocate for such a forum?
