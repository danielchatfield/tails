<blockquote>The system has a Secure Erase feature that can be accessed by a mouse right click.</blockquote>
 
Has this feature, perhaps, been removed since this thread was started? 

I have looked quite carefully and could not find any such \"Secure Erase\" feature in the right-click menu (for files I had saved onto media).

<blockquote>keep in mind that securely deleting individual files can provide a false sense of security; all kinds of traces can still remain in the form of automatic back-up, temp. files, etc.</blockquote>

Not only that but according to what I've read, even securely deleting (overwriting) all <i>unused space</i> on a drive does not guarantee that no tracks will be left behind.

Apparently this has to do-- at least in large part-- with the way <i>journaling</i> file systems work.

This all goes well over my knowledge and understanding but I must wonder whether or not that means that using the <b>ext2</b> file system would avoid such concerns, since it isn't a journaling FS (as <b>ext3</b> and <b>ext4</b> are).

<blockquote>what about in live systems? If your running from a disk is there really a need to securly delete files?</blockquote> 

Obviously, anything saved <i>only in the RAM-disk</i> of a live environment will be irrecoverably lost after shutdown. It is for this very reason, however, that it is quite common, while running live, to <i>save and/or access files from <b>media*</b></i>. 

I am quite certain that it is for such files that any \"secure erase\" function in a live CD would be intended.

(*USB drive or even the internal hard drive of the computer being used, which can easily be mounted and written-to while running live, at least in my experience with several different distros).
