My reasons for running Nautilus as root:

1.) Have found it is often the only way I can access my LUKS-encrypted volumes.

2.) When I run up against permissions restrictions in (even non-encrypted) media 

3.) To change permissions for files and directories

I thought *gksudo* was okay for such purposes.
