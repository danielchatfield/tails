1. The root user indeed is not pre-configured. It is not actually meant to be used for such things.
2. I doubt Nautilus can be considered safe to be run with root credentials.

=> I think you are trying to do stuff we can not afford supporting, so you're on your own.
Maybe the real bug / feature request you want to report lies in your answer to \"why do you need to run Nautilus as root to begin with\".
