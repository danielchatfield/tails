I understand how to import another person's public key, in order to encrypt messages for them... but where do I find my public key to give to others to encrypt messages for me?

I thought I was supposed to open a text editor, go to the "Sign" option and pick which key to use, but there was nothing on the drop down menu to select.

Do I need to do something else first, to generate a public key?
