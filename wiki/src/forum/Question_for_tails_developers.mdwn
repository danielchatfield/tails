First, I'd just like to say that you guys are doing a great job and hope tails becomes even greater than it is now. I haven't used liberte or any of the other systems alike. So I can't compare, but tails seems to have just as good of features as those of others claim to have on their homepages. 

I'm wondering if the developers all use tails when they use the internet etc?
