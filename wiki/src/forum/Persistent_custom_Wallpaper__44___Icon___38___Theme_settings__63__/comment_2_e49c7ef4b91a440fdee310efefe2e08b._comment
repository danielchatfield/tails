> 1) is there a way I can alter these locked folders and have my Tails beautified-at-startup without an attacker being able to alter them also?

Probably, using persistence. See the [[documentation|doc]].
But I guess you'll have to find yourself what exact set of files you need to make persistent,
and please be aware that then, you're using the resulting modified system at your own risks.
In short: please do make sure you know what you're doing.

> 2) If i can, will icon-sets or Themes from a different distro of Linux work in Tails (once I find where to put them/where their settings are stored)?

Most of the GNOME / GTK themes should work, as long as the versions are compatible.
