yes, and maybe being popular isn't always the best thing either. If Tails were fully customisable eye-candy, it would become much more popular. And attract the attention of more adversaries of privacy than it does now. Typically local police organizations go for the 'low hanging fruit'; the most gain with the least effort. Partly because because their ranks are comprised of a rather low caliber of individual to begin with.  As long as the vast majority of internet users are NOT using Tails, there is plenty of low-hanging fruit to be had without the complexity of working to compromise this OS.  If the majority of internet users WERE using Tails, police/governments would have no choice but to develop a solution.
