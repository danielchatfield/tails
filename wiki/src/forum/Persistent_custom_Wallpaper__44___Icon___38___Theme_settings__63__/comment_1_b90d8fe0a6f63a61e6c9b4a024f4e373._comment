\"Eye-candy\" may be incompatible with anonymity and computer security.  

I don't want to imagine how a wallpaper could be used to deanonymize you, but you might want to use your usual OS to visit 

   http://browserspy.dk/

to check out some of the items which are, all too often, readily available to commercial snoops who seek to track our web-browsing from site to site.  

Then try default Tails and compare results.  Then try changing your browser configuration to not turn off Javascript entirely, to not send a referer line, etc.  You will probably see progressive improvements in how much information your browser gives up \"voluntarily\", but this comes at the price of making your browser fingerprint much more distinctive.  

You can also visit

  http://ip-check.info/?lang=en

  https://panopticlick.eff.org/index.php?action=log 

for some re-identification and browser fingerprint tests.  (For the benefit of all, it might be a good idea to allow eff.org to set a cookie if you test at Panopticlick repeatedly.  Be aware that your fingerprint may be much more unique than Panopticlick suggests since people who test there form a self-selected sample.)
