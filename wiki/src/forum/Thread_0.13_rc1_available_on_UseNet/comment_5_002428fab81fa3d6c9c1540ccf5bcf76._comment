You forgot to mention HOW (step-by-step) to verify the PGP Signature; there may be new people that don't have a clue. Or at least point to the link that explains this.

So many posts are partial and make assumptions. Like the one that states he runs a script to modify the logs and never shows the script or how to use it or even the WHY behind using said script.
