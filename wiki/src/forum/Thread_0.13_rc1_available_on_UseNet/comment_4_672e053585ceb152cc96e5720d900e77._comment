Sounds like you just had an unlucky server allocation... the .iso files are served by numerous mirrors with each download from this site being directed to one of those servers on a quasi-random round-robinesque schudleimagig... if you'd cancelled and tried again you'd almost certainly have got a better service.

There's certainly no harm in spreading Tails around. Although **EVERY DOWNLOADED .ISO MUST be verified against THE PGP SIGNATURE**, ideally, **THE PGP SIGNATURE** downloaded from links on this site. As I'm sure you meant to say. **THE PGP SIGNATURE** and **THE PGP SIGNATURE** alone is **THE ONLY WAY TO VERIFY**. Forget hashes - they only spot download corruption and offer **NO SECURITY WHATSOEVER*. Use **THE PGP SIGNATURE** people! **THE PGP SIGNATURE** detects download corruption at least as well as raw hashes AND provides *STRONG CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUTHENTICATION*. Hashes are obsolete and pointless. They serve no useful purpose. They are rendered redundant by **THE PGP SIGNATURE**. Use **THE PGP SIGNATURE**, only the **THE PGP SIGNATURE** and nothing but **THE PGP SIGNATURE**.

Hope I've got that across! ;-)
