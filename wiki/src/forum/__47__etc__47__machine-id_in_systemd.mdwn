I don't know what version of udev TAILS uses, but udev as you may know is merged with systemd upstream. This will affect TAILS sooner or later.

the new systemd version makes use of a /etc/machine-id
http://0pointer.de/public/systemd-man/machine-id.html
"Programs may use this ID to identify the host with a globally unique ID in the network, that does not change even if the local network configuration changes."

Sweet fuck!

the fix? given that its a 32 character hexidecimal string, its damn easy to generate new ones at random with md5

the fix from ninja os: add this to rc.local or any other script that runs at bootL:

chmod 666 /etc/machine-id
head -n128 < /dev/urandom |md5sum |cut -d ' ' -f 1 > /etc/machine-id
chmod 644 /etc/machine-id

This caught me with my pants down. I am posting this to give you guys a heads up
