Apparently, the website visit needs to be verified as it may have only been an about:DownThemAll! webpage that came up it the other Tab after installation which, of couse, did not break anonymity.

Its late and I need sleep at this time, so if anyone can verify this before I can get to it again tomorrow night, please let us know.
