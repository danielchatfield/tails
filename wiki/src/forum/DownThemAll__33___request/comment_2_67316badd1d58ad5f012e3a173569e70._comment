Ok, I have just verified that what I was initially looking at (last night) was an about:DownThemAll! web page internally initiated by Iceweasel via the newly installed DownThemAll! download manager - i.e. there was no external DownThemAll! website access (no anonymity breakage).

I initially (last night) thought it was and external webpage access (I jumped the gun by deleting the Tab before I was able to actually verify it as an external access not using Tor) and before I carefully looked at it just now.

It was NOT an external webpage access at all, but an internal one, so NO anonymity break as written up in original post.

Now - how do I test the anonymity via downloading an external website page or image, etc?
