>Now - how do I test the anonymity via downloading an external website page or image, etc?

Testing 3rd-party program/addon anonymity inside Tails is difficult.

The most reliable method is to review and understand every bit of the 3rd-party program/addon's source code. Scrutinize any obfuscation, follow every possible code path, check every possible condition/variable range, and thoroughly examine every instance of network interaction.

A much less reliable method is to put Tails in a guest VM with bridged networking or NAT to the host, which would be configured for promiscuous packet sniffing. Then you could analyze the traffic and look through each and every packet for outgoing/incoming connections that are not Tor nodes. Next you would need to turn off Tor in Tails or add a packet sniffer to Tails that would capture traffic before it goes through Tor; in this traffic you would look for any packets going to/from somewhere other than the download uri and look through packet headers/bodies for any unnecessary client data/info. Even if you do this perfectly, it still won't be as safe as reviewing the source code because you don't know all the potential use cases and control flows that might produce different behaviors.
