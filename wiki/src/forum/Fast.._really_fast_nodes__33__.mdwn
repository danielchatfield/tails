hi,

Tor nodes with same node names became in some cases exponentially larger bandwidth as mentioned in vidalia with tails 0.17 compared to 0.16. Why did this happen? or its only me?

-btw, ALL my download speeds were significantly higher than mentioned bandwidths on nodes in 0.16. Perhaps the info is wrong?


please explain these occurences. Thank you
