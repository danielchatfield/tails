>You must have reposted material from several webpages, correct? I don't think that's very useful unless you give links and just quote small relevant portions from each page

No. Not useful AT ALL

>together with your own questions.

No. One question per thread.


>In general, if you can clearly state question**<strike>s</strike>** and can explain how they relate to your use of Tails, I think your threads will be more likely to be permitted here.

It doesn't relate to Tails. Not *this* OP anyway.. and *this OP* is the topic of *this thread*. Hence the ridicule. The ridiculous is being ridiculed - not that much of a surprise,  surely?

>In general, I suspect that hitting the capslock key invites mockery even in a forum in which the readership presumably favors anonymity over surveillance.

Capslock is certainly bad form but I very much doubt it was *that* that triggered the reception this ridiculously bloated, ancient, off-topic spam received. 

>For Linux, I've ran rkhunter, chkrootkit, tiger, and other tools and nothing malicious is found. Without a deep binary analysis I don't know what else I could do.

Audit the source.



>Unfortunately, the moderators here have said that they don't want to see any questions here which are not narrowly focused on Tails specifically. 

Fortunately, as the developers here have stated ad nauseam, they don't want to waste this small project's precious resources on questions here which are not specific to Tails. 

There. Fixed that for you 0:)

>Linux packet radio is one interesting topic you raised which in the short term probably offers more opportunities for activists than for autocrats. So too bad we can't discuss it here, because clearly this forum needs the occasional optimism-promoting thread.

Linux packet radio is an obscure topic you raised which has absolutely nothing to do with Tails. So luckily we can't discuss it here, because clearly this forum needs the O/T crap kept to a minimum.

There. Fixed that one for you too. Consider it an early Christmas present 0:)
