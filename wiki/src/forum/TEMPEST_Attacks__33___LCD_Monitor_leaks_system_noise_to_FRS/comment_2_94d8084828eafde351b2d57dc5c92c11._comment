No, many discussions of that type are removed because they sound completely moronic and usually aren't backed up by even a slightly believable theory, they also usually just come of as a paranoid conspiratorial ramblings, and this post certainly isn't an exception to that.

Also this is not even remotely relevant to Tails so it has no place in this forum.
