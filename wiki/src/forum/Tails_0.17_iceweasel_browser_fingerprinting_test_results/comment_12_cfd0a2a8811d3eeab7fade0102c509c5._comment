At least two problems with that suggestion:


First: 

> FIREGLOVE firefox and ice wheal [iceweasel] extension (addon) make all the users *unique*.

That is exactly the opposite of what everyone else wants.  Everyone else wants all Tor users to be mutually indistinguishable.  Maybe you simply misspoke.

Second:

Installing random add-ons is dangerous because any one of them could break security/anonymity features of Tails.  Further, real world attempted MITM attacks have specifically targeted the mozilla add-ons server using stolen but genuine certificates.
