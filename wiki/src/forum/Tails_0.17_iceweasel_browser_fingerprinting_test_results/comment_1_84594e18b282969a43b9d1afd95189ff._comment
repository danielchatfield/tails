I am clueless, so feel free to ignore. If the 4th option is presumably the 'ideal' for surfing 'safe', assuming all Tails users did it, which is presumably the way they should be doing. Does not the fact they are clearly not, show that Tails needs to set these as defaults in order to make those of us who 'do things the right way' have better anonymity? In before usual crap about new users not knowing what they are doing- if you are using Tails, you can presumably learn fast.
