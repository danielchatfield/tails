FIREGLOVE firefox and ice wheal extension (addon) make all the users unique.  Try it. It has in its options settings many features like randomising timezone, useragent, screenresolution etc.

TAILS should incorporate this addon because the results are always the same when we use this addon. These days millions of people are using this addon as this has the capability to spoof fingerprints each time you open any website.

I have checked it with wireshark and it doesn't leak anything.,
