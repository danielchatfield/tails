if you go around the todo pages you will see that the torrent client most likely to be included in tails is Transmission. However, since it has not yet been audited it could still screw your anonymity. You'll just to wait on this one if you want to do it rigth..

Besides torrenting on tor can be problematic for the network so it is not recomended to do so. I believe there is also a program called onioncat or something for torrenting within the tor network without going through the exits, you would then have much less torrents available (for the moment at least) and like if you torrent through an exit, crappy speeds and if you don't want to screw tor for everyone you'd have to give back 6x the bandwith by running a relay. 

So, unfortunatly TORrenting is still not easy to do. When the devs find a way to safely enabling this they will probably do so. In the meanwhile you migth want to have a look at the i2p console in tails and the i2psnak program within it.
