Yesterday I was seeing all the menus of TAILS USB to understand about this operating system. In my country, linux is not used because pirated CDs of Windows are easily available and people have no time to learn linux. I wonder why they don't switch the interface/coding from command-based operating system like Windows so as to enable everyone to understand this operating system. Anyways, while seeing all the features of TAILS, I came across something \"I2p\". When I clicked on it, it closed my valiala bundle but the browser was still using IP address of TOR saying that I was connected to TOR network. 

I searched about it, but could not understand from the website of i2p as to how does it work and how does it differ from Tails/TOR. Other links took me to other blogs and websites where it was mentioned that i2p is more secure system as compared to TOR.

I2P was changing the IP address but I could not see the nodes that it was using. How can I ensure myself that I2P in TAILS is indeed connected to 3 nodes? Give me some solution.

When TAILS is said to be enough to protect the privacy, why i2p has been included into TAILS ISO file/operating system?

Because it is included in Tails, i consider it as a perfect system equivalent to TAILS, but still I wanna confirm it from the TAILS forum members the security and anonymity aspects of both the systems that protect us.

Thanks in anticipation..
