Sorry for missing your point.

The answer is \"more or less\":

1. Tails ships wireless firmware that Debian Squeeze does not ship
   out-of-the-box (available in non-free, though).

2. Tails currently ships Squeeze's kernel but is likely to ship 2.6.38 once it
   enters squeeze-backports.

=> Tails generally reflects (almost) the best wireless support one can get from
Debian stable + backports + non-free, without hand-compiling software that is
not part of Debian, without recompiling the kernel with ugly experimental
third-party patches.
