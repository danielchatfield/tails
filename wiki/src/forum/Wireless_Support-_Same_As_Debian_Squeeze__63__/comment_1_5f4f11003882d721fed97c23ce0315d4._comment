Seems like the needed driver is in the 2.6.38 Linux kernel, which is not shipped
in Tails 0.7, and won't be shipped in Tails 0.7.1 either (see [this
thread](https://boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2011-April/000287.html) for the
rationale).

I guess we'll be able to ship >=2.6.38 in Tails 0.8, if not in another 0.7.x
point-release.
