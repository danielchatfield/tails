Please can someone show me how to implement NDISWARPPER in Tails so I can use my WIFI adaper which only come with windows drivers? 

Lubuntu 10.04 comes with a gui utility in the menu that does everything for you. 

All you have to do is point to the windows drivers and it loads up your wifi interface.
