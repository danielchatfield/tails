Thanks for the prompt reply but the question in my first paragraph remains:

Is support for devices such as wireless adapters in (the current release of) Tails generally the same as for the release of Debian it (Tails) is built-on?

In other words, if someone wants to know whether or not the current release of Tails will support a given wireless adapter or other device, can he just ascertain whether or not said device is supported by the current release of Debian Squeeze?
