Hello,

I checked my (untweeked) Tails system at ip-check.info and surprisingly it got two "bad" scores. 

1. Cache (E-Tags): 

Bad: Your browser is trackable by e-tags. 

Recommended: Your browser should not cache any third party content at all, or should at least delete them upon moving to another site.

Firefox: Use JonDoFox. Alternatively, you may switch off the cache completely: about:config, browser.cache.disk.enable:false, browser.cache.memory.enable:false

2. Fonts

Bad: 48 installed fonts have been found on your computer.

Recommended: monospace, serif, times new roman

Firefox: Open about:config and set browser.display.use_document_fonts to 0. For a better font readability, you should moreover set Settings:Content:Default font to Arial, Helvetica or Sans-Serif.

Can you comment on this? Is it a reason to be worried?

If I understand the "Warning" section of Tails web site correctly it doesn't warn against the two "bad" scores.
