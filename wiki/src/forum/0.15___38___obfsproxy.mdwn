Now that Tails supports obfsproxy in 0.15, how do we use this new feature?

Do we obtain an obfsproxy bridge IP by visiting:

https://bridges.torproject.org/?transport=obfs2

and enter "bridge" as a boot option and enter the obfsproxy bridge IP:PORT there?

Or is obfsproxy already enabled without the use of a special bridge(s)?

Can additional obfs2 bridges be added during use or should one or more be specified during the boot options process?
