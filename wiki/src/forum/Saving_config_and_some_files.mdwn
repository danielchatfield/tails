Hello,

I am using Tails via .iso in VM and I really beginning to like it. Unfortunately I am also new to Linux, but that should not be the problem.

I'd love to save some configuration and files to reuse them, after a restart of Tails. That would be:

 - Monitor preferences
 - Keyboard preferences
 - Claws Mail e-mails + preferences + account info
 - GnuPG key

Furthermore:

 - Login data -> user:password saved. In Windows I use Keepass for this purpose.
 - Some files

I thought it would be a good idea to save all that I mentioned above on a USB drive and encrypt that with LURKS/TrueCrypt. On the same drive would be TC portable, if I don't use LURKS and a little handy bash-script to apply config/preferences to Tail.

Like said before, I am new to Linux, so I would be very thankful, if someone could tell me where I find the config/pref files and if it is possible to change them "on the fly".

Did I forget something important?


Have a nice day! :)
