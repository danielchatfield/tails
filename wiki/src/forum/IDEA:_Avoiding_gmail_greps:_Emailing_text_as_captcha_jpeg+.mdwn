Avoiding gmail greps of email text 
==================================
I just had a privacy idea I wanted to run by yous:

###Idea
Emailing an image of message text. This image would be of your email
message. But by sending it as a black & white image file, you avoid
gmail (and all the other slightly psychotic data hoarders) from using
grep functions to scan all our emails.

###Pros
1. No exchange of keys necessary or encryption plugins needed.
2. Thus, for the email recipient it is very user-friendly.

###Cons
Its far from ideal privacy but is a definite spanner in the works!

###Further idea
1. A thunderbird plugin to do this would be good :-)
2. A slight captcha adjustment to the image would spin out gmail robots
even more!
I came across this command to convert text to .gif at: 

<http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/4943/convert-text-to-picture>

      echo -e "Some Text Line1\nSome Text Line 2" | convert -background none -density 196  -resample 72 -unsharp 0x.5 -font "Courier" text:- -trim +repage -bordercolor white -border 3  text.gif

###Questions
1. Has someone already come up with this idea?
2. If not, where do you think would be a good place to bring this idea up
for discussion? 
3. Can you recommend any command line kung fu to convert txt to jpeg?

*Let me know what you think.*
