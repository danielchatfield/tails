Hi,

Firefox 3.6.13 throws up this warning when I try to access this site via SSL:

_________Begin Quoted Message____________

boum.org uses an invalid security certificate.

The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.

(Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)
_______End Quoted Message_____________

I've accessed your site via SSL many times in the past and never had this problem before.  I'm running Linux Mint Debian Edition live and have not had a problem for any of the several other SSL sites I have just accessed. 

Here is my exact user agent info from http://ipid.shat.net :

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101216 Linux Mint/1 (Debian) Firefox/3.6.13
