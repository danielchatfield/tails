Hello, complete tech newbie Windows user here. I'm starting to use Tails because of this orwellian new SOPA/PIPA legislation, and I was just wondering - once I've set it up (formatted USB/installed/booted etc) am I essentially safe? I'll just be using Tails for regular internet browsing, social networking, online mail clients etc, so I don't think there'll be any particularly complicated security issues. I've read and mostly understood the documentation available on the website(except the technical stuff of which I have no understanding whatsoever!) Is there anything else I need to do before using Tails to make sure I'm safe, or is Tails "plug and play" so to speak?
