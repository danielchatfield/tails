This forum is for open discussion. 
Tails contributors & development are the ones from whom you are most likely going to get an answer that solves your problem. And they regular reply to topics from users.

If you have any urgent issue or want to chat with the developers join the chat room: #tails at server: irc.oftc.net port: 6697

You also have option of emailing at tails@boum.org

All sub-topic you mentioned are already well documented [here](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html) and are regularly updated.

Its better to have all things in one place rather than searching in & out of sub-forums. Also, there is additional overhead of managing users with superficial egos (number of comments,date joined,h/w spec, etc). Which is pointless since almost everyone replies as 'Anonymous'

Keep it simple. Read the documentation. ;)
