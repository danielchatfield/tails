>Then you wouldn't be answering the same questions all the time, you could make certain answers stickies. How Tails devs have stuck with this crap is beyond me.

Wikis is more organized than stickies. We could edit the space above the forum and make it REALLY BIG if people keep asking the same questions in the forum. Same as a sticky. Link from there directly to a wiki page, instead of click on forum topic and click again to get to wiki page.
