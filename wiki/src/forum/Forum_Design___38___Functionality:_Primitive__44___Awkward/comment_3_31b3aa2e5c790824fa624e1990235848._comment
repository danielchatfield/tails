Bizarre.  Why aren't you using readily available, free forum software? Google suggests for eg http://www.simplemachines.org/  or http://ikonboard.net/

Then you wouldn't be answering the same questions all the time, you could make certain answers stickies.  How Tails devs have stuck with this crap is beyond me.
