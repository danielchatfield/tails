The only thing the forum needs is a way to bump the threads when a comment is added. Is this what the [sortbylastcomment](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/sortbylastcomment_plugin/) plugin, does? (It is mentioned here -> <https://tails.boum.org/todo/improve_the_forum/>.) If yes, why not install that?

This way you have wiki and forum integrated together. [Recent Changes](https://tails.boum.org/recentchanges/) shows edits to the forum and the rest of the wiki. If you want people to edit the wiki I don't think you should have another forum. It is a lot less bloated than other types of forum software and easier than a MediaWiki talkpage. However dedicated forum software would probably be easier for newbies unless they can have a few buttons for quoting and whatnot.
