Hi. We are somehow conscious that our forum is a little primitive and awkward.
Our website is based on [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info) which is on the other
hand a incredibly flexible tool for us developers. But as it's not a very old
software there are definitely things to improve.

Anyway, thanks to make concrete proposal for improvements. I already implemented
some of it.

- The button of the form to create a new post in now called 'OK'.

- We will now try, as Tails developers, to post under the 'Tails' nickname to
  make it more clear who we are. Other people can freely register and sign in to
  be identified. But since Tails is aiming at making it easier to be anonymous
  online we don't want to force people to have to sign up to post. So there we
  still be some confusion about who is who but we indeed see that as an
  anonymity protection measure.

- We change the RSS feed to include new thread and new comments as well. So
  that someone who wants to follow the forum activity can subscribe to the
  feed using an RSS feed reader. Without the need to create an account on the
  site.

- The rest of your proposals are gathered on a new todo list item I just
  created. See, [[todo/improve_the_forum]].
