If you must establish a PPP connection, your modem being plugged over Ethernet, USB, serial or whatever does not change the problem: this is not supported in Tails yet. You need to use that kind of modems that can be configured to establish the PPP connection itself; you are right about one thing, though: such modems generally are Ethernet ones.
