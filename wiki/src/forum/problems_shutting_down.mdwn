Hi there. I boot from a Cd-r and flashdrive. My flashdrive seems more reliable at the moment. Tails on the Cd-r failed to shutdown properly. When I would click the little red power button in the system tray (whatever you wanna call it) nothing happened. I was forced to remove the cd-r to shutdown. The memory wiping was marked as failed and I waited 10min and the system did not shutdown. I was then forced to physcially press the power button on my pc. 
I am wondering, how can I wipe the memory that did not get wiped?
How can I solve  this issue so this doesn't happen more with my cd-r?

Secondly, besides not shutting down properly, the cd-r sometimes cannot get passed the first screen when booting up (screen that says isolinx and copyright information). Eariler, I had a cd-r that encountered issues due to the fact it was too dirty, this cd-r seems fine. 

Any information on these issues would be nice,
Thanks, _____________
