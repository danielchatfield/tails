Looking at buying a Windows 8 tablet but only if I can dual boot tails on a sdcard. I've heard the back and forth about linux running on clover trail processors and was wondering if anyone here has gotten tails to work on one. I'm looking at the Thinkpad tablet 2 but anything with the new atom in general.
