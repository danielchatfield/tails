>Why you are using Tails? Why you are NOT using Liberté Linux ?


Liberté is not as well known, their web forum software is broken under a properly configured Tails session, some users may trust a team working more closely with Tor developers than a lone individual, and the question equally applies to this one:


\"Why am I not using one of the hundreds of distros available instead of Tails?\" See Distrowatch.
