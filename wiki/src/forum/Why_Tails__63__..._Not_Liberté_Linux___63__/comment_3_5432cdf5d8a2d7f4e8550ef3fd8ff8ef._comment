Liberte Linux presupposes users to have at least an elementary knowledge of Linux commands. Many Tails users don't even have that knowledge; they are mostly Microsoft Windows users.

Unlike Tails, there is no support or discussion forum for Liberte Linux users.

Liberte Linux has not been extensively peer-reviewed. The Tor Project recommends Tails on its blog. There is no mention of Liberte Linux there.
