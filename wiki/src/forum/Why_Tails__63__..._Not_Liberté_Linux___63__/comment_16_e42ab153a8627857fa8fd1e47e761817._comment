> after checking the previous version vuln. of tails, i asked myself \"did i just use a fully exploitable browser for a while, until tails dropped another release a month later?\" yes..

Our current plan is to publish a Tails release one *week* after a Firefox ESR is out. We clearly have been much more late than this in the past, but wenow have the tools needed to make our [[contribute/release_schedule]] realistic.

I don't think we can do any better before we have [[todo/automated_builds_and_tests]].
