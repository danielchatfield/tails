>Why you are using Tails? Why you are NOT using LibertÃ© Linux ?

Liberte apparently has more Linux security features working.

On the other hand Liberte seems like it would have a more unique browser fingerprint. If it had Torbrowser this would seem to give it the most common browser fingerprint. I have some questions about this but it deserves its own thread.

>Anon #2 Liberte forum - http://forum.dee.su/#home

I enabled javascript and went to the forum. While the page was open Tails froze. It doesn't do that very often.

The Liberte developer warns of the dangers of using javascript and had it disabled in the browser. Why would they then require javascript in order to communicate with the public about Liberte?

If the Souceforge forum were reopened, I would be more inclined to use that one.
