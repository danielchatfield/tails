>some users may trust a team working more closely with Tor developers than a lone individual

I know next to nothing about Liberte` but if you are indeed correct that it is the work of \"a lone individual\", then you make a good point here.

Nonetheless, I would (and no doubt many others) would feel a lot better about TAILS if the devs would **identify themselves-- as all of the folks behind the Tor Project do**. 

If the Tor Project folks can identify themselves, why shouldn't the TAILS folks? 

Also, another thing that has caused me to lose a lot of the respect and trust that I formerly had for the TAILS devs is exemplified in the following thread:

https://tails.boum.org/forum/AdBlock_Plus_Icon_Missing__33__/

Unless we're missing something here (I as well as the critical views expressed in that thread), the TAILS devs for some reason found it a worthwhile use of what they claim to be their limited, already-strained time and resources to go out of their way to alter a *useful* default of ABP...all not only for no apparent purpose but with decidedly *negative* results that considerably *impair* the user experience. 

Details at the above URL.
