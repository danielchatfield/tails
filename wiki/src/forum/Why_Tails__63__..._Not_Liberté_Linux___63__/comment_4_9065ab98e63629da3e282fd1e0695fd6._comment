Liberte forum - http://forum.dee.su/#home

I have never used Linux before nor did I need to use the terminal in my Liberte sessions.

The biggest problem I have with TAILS is well summarized here:

\" And a general sliming down of the distro to the essential items and focus on the anonymous web access will probable keep its size at CD level.\"

Hopefully \"light\" edition will come somewhere in the future.

Liberte does not have any support for TrueCrypt containers nor is mounting LUKS volumes very user friendly. Big minus.

I still don't like Midori, the browser in Liberte.

Inclusion of RedShift (http://jonls.dk/redshift/) was a genius move.

Good and both sides of both, waiting which one will implement obfsproxy and persistent guards first.
