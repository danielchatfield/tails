Greetings!

I just booted Tails on my other computer and as I wanted to login,the tails greeter got stuck,somehow..

Eveyrtime I enter a password and repeat it, the greeter always goes back to the Login screen. Always the first window where it asks me for further options... Even tough the passwords match, I cannot login,I can't get past the greeter window.

Now, also tried to just click on login (without this administrator thing) bt the greete won't have it, I always get the same questions about the further options.

So i was hoping that you can haelp me, since I am stuck completely^^

Thank you in advance
