Several sites I have tried to access use jQuery to wire up event handlers for button presses, for example.  These do not seem to work in Iceweasel on TAILS 0.15.  When such a button is clicked, no network activity happens, although it clearly should, leading me to believe that the event handler has not been wired up properly.  I have changed all of the settings that I think could be remotely related in Iceweasel (allow popups, allow JavaScript to do everything, etc.), but it still does not work.  Am I overlooking something or is this a know limitation?
