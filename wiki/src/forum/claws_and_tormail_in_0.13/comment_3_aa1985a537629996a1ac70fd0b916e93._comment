Have the exact same issue. Has anyone else got this issue, or a possible solution? 

My settings are the following:

IMAP
Name of account: name
Full name: name
Mail address: name@tormail.net
Server for receiving: jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion
SMTP server (send): jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion
User ID: name
Password: password
NO SSL, NO SMTP Authentication (SMTP AUTH)

Note: 'name' is the same throughout.

I've tried a bunch of combinations, and can't figure out what's wrong.
