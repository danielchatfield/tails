Indeed, I you've found a bug which will be fixed in Tails 0.14, which is due at the end of this month. The release candidate will be released in a few days, so make sure to grab it and test the fix.

Until then you can temporarily fix this issue by running the following command in a Tails 0.13 session(requires administrative privileges):

    sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 3 -o lo -p tcp --dport 9040 -j ACCEPT
