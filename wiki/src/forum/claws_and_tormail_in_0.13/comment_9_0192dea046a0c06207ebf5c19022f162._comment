I already report it with wisper back which seems the only way to report bugs.

But there was already a bug report on this. I can no longer find it to even determine if it was fixed or not. Somewhere around 0.13 this issue showed up and it was supposed to be fixed from my understand at that time. I don't see any way just to search the bugs.
