yeah, i tried pretty much all combinations of SSL/NO-SSL/STARTSSL and ports 143/993. The excact error i am getting is:

** IMAP error on jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion: connection refused

The error comes almost instantly, so i dont even think it tries to connect to the onion. Anyone else successfully connected to a IMAP onion service with claws?
