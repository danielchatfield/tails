A GPT partition flag is used to ask Windows not to display Tails
partitions. You're free to remove this flag. So yes, regardless
of whether that's advisable, it is possible to do what you're
asking for. Now, the resulting stick will obviously be entirely
unsupported by us (as adding / removing / modifying random files
on the Tails partition results in user support hell), so please
don't report bugs etc. about it if you ever do that.
