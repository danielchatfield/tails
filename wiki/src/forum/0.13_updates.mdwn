Is Tor and Vidalia being updated to latest release, and is there any hardening done to the Tails kernal like Liberte Linux is sporting? 

"Liberté Linux is shipped with the Hardened Gentoo kernel, which includes all grsecurity/PaX security enhancements — radically improving system's resistance to software exploits. Measures like service privileges separation provide additional protection"

Nice work Tails
