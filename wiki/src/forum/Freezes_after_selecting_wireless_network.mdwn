I am running links off of a USB.  everything works great on a wired connection.  when i select a wireless network and enter the WPA password, the entire system freezes. no mouse, no keyboard, no clock.  everything locks and i have to hard reboot.  any ideas?  i have this issue when using a USB and a DVD copy.
