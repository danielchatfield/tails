You're probably running the ISO image as a CD-ROM in VirtualBox, right?

Persistence is only available when running from an USB stick, so VirtualBox must \"see\" an USB stick (be it real or emulated) with Tails on it.

VirtualBox can connect a physical USB stick to the VM, but I don't know if it can *emulate* one. You have to do some research on this
