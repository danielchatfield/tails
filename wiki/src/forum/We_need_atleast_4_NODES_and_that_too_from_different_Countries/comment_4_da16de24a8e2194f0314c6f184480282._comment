for request #2: a quote from the design document

>Stuff we don't want to actively support making persistent: web browser addons
>(while we don't want to make it impossible to install addons, we think it's a really bad idea, and won't actively support it, since it partitions the Tails users anonymity set, thus having bad consequences both on people who do it and on others)

so it looks like it won't happen. what addons do you wish to use?
