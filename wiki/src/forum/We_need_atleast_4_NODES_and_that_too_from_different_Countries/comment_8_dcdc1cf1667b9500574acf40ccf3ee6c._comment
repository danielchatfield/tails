@ the original poster:

Are you referring to the analysis by \"Raccoon\" which was posted some years ago on Tor-talk?

    http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html

If so, another thread on this forum also discussed this analysis:

    https://tails.boum.org/forum/__34__Raccoon__34___revisited/


I'd like to reopen this thread because I fear that people could be harmed if such arguments are misunderstood,  As someone already pointed out, moving the discussion to the Tor-talk mailing list is infeasible because the email addresses of Tor-talk posters are visible to other subscribers (although not in the seul.org archive).
