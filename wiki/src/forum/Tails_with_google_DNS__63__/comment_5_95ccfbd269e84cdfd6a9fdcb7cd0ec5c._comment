**To comment 3:**

> dnsleaktest.com is a very well reputed site and recommended by VPN's for DNS leak tests.

This is great, but it does not make it change the way Tor works, that is: you depend on Exit nodes to do DNS resolution for you.

> I've run this test using VPN and there were no Google hosts.

This tends to indicate your VPN provider does not use Google DNS servers as their upstream.

> It is not possible that all exit nodes use google DNS.

Correct. The results you've mentioned (and that I've reproduced) only tend to indicate that *some* exit nodes use Google DNS as their upstream, which I find not surprising at all. I don't see only Google DNS servers IP in that dnsleaktest.com.

> The same results come up using Tails no matter what exit node is used.

I cannot reproduce this. Care to explain how exactly one may reproduce this experiment?

> That leads me to conclude that it is a Tails issue, and a very serious one.

I doubt it, until some reproducible test procedure is described.
Bonus points if it does not rely on what some blackbox service tells you.

**To comment 4:**

> Can someone explain why it is dangerous to use Google's DNS?

I don't think it's dangerous to have a portion of Tor exit nodes use Google DNS servers.
