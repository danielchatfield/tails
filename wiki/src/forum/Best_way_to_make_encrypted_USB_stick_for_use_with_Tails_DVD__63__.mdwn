Due to hardware limitations my laptop won't boot from a USB stick.  At least, there is no entry in the BIOS giving me an option to boot from removable memory, or if there is, I can't recognize it.

So as far as I know, I can only use Tails when I reboot with the live DVD.

For obvious reasons I'd like to be able to use some kind of strongly encrypted removable storage.  Since this is a laptop I think that means I must use a USB stick to store files.  I read the Tails documentation pages but unfortunately

<https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html>

starts by assuming the user is running Tails from a live USB stick.

I have some basic questions which the documentation pages did not appear to answer (and the search tool didn't show me anything helpful).

* Is LUKS is the approved method of encryption for USB sticks?
* Is it true that SSD (sp?) devices can be risky because shred/wipe will not in fact "securely delete" a file?  How about USB sticks?
* If I have a cheap USB stick, can I... create an AES-CBC encrypted logical volume (?) ... with LUKS while using Tails (running from the live DVD), and then store/retrieve files there?
