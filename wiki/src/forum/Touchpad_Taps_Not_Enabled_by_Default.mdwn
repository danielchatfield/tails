Is there a reason why touchpad taps are not enabled by default in TAILS?

This is in contrast to what seems like the overwhelming majority of other distros I have tried, in which touchpads taps have been enabled by default.

Granted, with so many other far more pressing issues, this ranks fairly low on the list. But still, it is rather annoying to have to manually change this setting each and every time I boot into TAILS (not using persistence), for what seems to be no good reason. 

Thanks for all your efforts.
