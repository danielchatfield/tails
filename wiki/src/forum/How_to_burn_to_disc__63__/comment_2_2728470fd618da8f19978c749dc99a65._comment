Don't be a dick.

From tails.boum.org?  Did you verify the certificate?  Did you also download the detached signature and the Tails signing key?

> and extracted the archive 

Wait a minute, you extracted an archive?  Like a gzipped tar file?  In that case, did you download Tor Browser Bundle (TBB), which comes as a gzipped tarball (archive), or Tails, which comes as a ready-to-burn iso image?

If you downloaded the most recent TBB tarball, you are ready to start using TBB, except that you should definitely have verified the detached signature using the TBB signing key (same procedure as for verifying a Tails iso, except different detached signatures of course and different keys since these are made by different Projects, and TBB comes as a tarball while Tails comes as an iso image).
