Hello.


Sometimes I would like to be able to define the country where my exits node is located.

So i opened the Vidalia Control Panel -> VidaliaShortcut -> View the Network -> Connection and deleted all circuits.... and selecting an other relay. but i am unable to define an exit node in a special country.
What am i doing wrong?


Thank you for any help.

Bill





PS 
I could imaging that this approach could compromize my security..
