I have seen discussion on this forum regarding the risk that a remote attacker could mount and access any attached media while one is running TAILS (or any OS, for that matter). 

What about volumes/drives that are properly *encrypted*?

Barring keylogging or the presence of the password or key in clear text somewhere on the running system or in an unencrypted volume (major "NO-NO"s), wouldn't any encrypted volume be just as safe*  from *remote* access/attack as it would be from *local*, i.e., physical access/attack?

(*That is, as safe as the strength of the password/key (usually the weakest link) and the encryption scheme itself)

Granted, *bootable* encrypted media (i.e., full-disk encryption OS installs) would presumable still pose a concern because of the necessarily unencrypted /boot partition. 

How much of a realistic risk, then, is remote tampering with the /boot partition? How difficult is it to pull-off?
