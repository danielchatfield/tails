Thanks for your work on tails.  Since a number of users are having problems with this time sync mechanism (including me):

1.  How do I re-run the system time sync from the command line when it fails?  As root or not?

2.  How do I restart vidalia and tor from the command line after that, and again, do I do that as root?

3.  Would it make sense to add a button to the 'time sync fails' dialog to re-try the time sync or at least provide a menu item to re-run this?

At present I am rebooting, which is tedious and doesn't always work anyway.
