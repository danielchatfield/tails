I suppose you read the instructions, and there are no physical problems (like a blocking router or so).

The first time you fire up your i2p router can take a while. I suggest waiting 10 minutes after starting the i2p router (see the i2p router webpage in favorites). Sometimes it helps me to restart the i2p router afterwards.

Keep an keen eye on the connection status tab, to verify your i2p router can make a connection \"outside\".
