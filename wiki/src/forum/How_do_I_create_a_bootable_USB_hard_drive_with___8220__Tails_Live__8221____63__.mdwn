How do I create a bootable USB hard drive with “Tails Live”?

Tails boots fine from my live DVD.

I ran Applications ▸ Tails ▸ Tails USB installer without a hitch targeting my USB HD.

Booted from the USB HD and tails wouldn’t start.  It stalls after the Debian progress turns completely white.

I also tried “Universal USB Installer” for Windows.  The same result.

What do I need to do to make my 1TB WD USB HD boot into “Tails Live”?

I want to save:     
• applications that I instal     
• files I create and use     
• my application preferences     
• my desktop layout     
• anything else that is part of working with a computer
