I remember some time ago - few releases back - Tails boot up pretty fast. Now things are much worse atleast for me. It is annoing when you want to reboot from time to time to properly change your identity.

Probably almost the half time of booting process is spended on this first greeting screen - you know - when you should press enter or tab.Either I press enter or not Tails seem to freeze on that screen for quite a long time and only after this delay goes to the loading bar. Is it normal?
