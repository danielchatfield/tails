I've got a computer with only FreeDOS on it.  How do I get TAILS running on a USB stick with this?

I've already set BIOS boot order to boot first from USB/DVDV etc..

What else do I need to do?  And I apologize I'm not very technically inclined so a 'Barney Style' explanation would rock.

Thanks in advance
