A similar tread talks about the very same thing you talk about:

https://tails.boum.org/forum/Unsafe_web_browser_unable_to_save_downloads/

Overall response: It's a bad idea as can open up new avenues of attack. One possible avenue is talked about in that tread.

A better solution IMHO than is talked about in there regarding sandboxing would be a two-layered virtualized system:

https://tails.boum.org/todo/Two-layered_virtualized_system/

but don't your hope up, this would be a big improvement but also extremelly costly of developers time who are focused in other tasks. No idea if this will ever be implemented.

Without this you should not expect the unsafe browser to able to do anything else than to enable logins (nor should you want it to)
