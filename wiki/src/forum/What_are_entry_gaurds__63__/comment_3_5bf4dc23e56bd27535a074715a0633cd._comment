> Censorship, really?

No. Keeping this forum within its announced scope, that its maintainers are happy to cope with, is certainly not censorship. It's merely protecting the Tails project from irresponsible growth / unplanned change of basic goals.

> The moderator removed my comment explaining the original motivation for the introduction of entry guards. Why? 

I did this because your comment was, as this whole thread, off-topic here, as mentioned in my first reply here. We've already written a few dozen times on this forum that we don't have the resources to maintain a general forum about Tor. You don't want us to stop making Tails, and instead maintain such a forum, do you?

> Before you mention Tor-talk, I feel that Tor-talk is unusable since

This is absolutely not something the Tails project will fix, nor deal with the consequences, sorry. (And even if I strongly disagree with the reasons you give bellow, I don't want to discuss this *here*.)

I suggest you talk about your concerns to the people who actually run tor-talk.
