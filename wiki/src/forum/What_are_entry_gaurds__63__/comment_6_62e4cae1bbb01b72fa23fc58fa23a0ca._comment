I've been disappointed so often before, but there's been a development which I hope points towards a way forward.

position, and helped talk Tom into being our new project
coordinator. (Woo!)

> Hello! I'm Tom Lowenthal; we may have spoken before, but I can tell
you all about me later.

> I'm Tor's new project coordinator, starting forthwith. I'm here to
deal with logistics and *communication*, and all kinds of other
interfering nonsense *so that Tor folks can focus on the stuff they
want to work on*, whatever that may be, and whether they're a volunteer
or compensated. I'm incredibly excited to get started!

(My emphasis)

He even has a GPG key, which is very good.  *But I can't tell from the message whether he is addressing Tor developers only or the wider Tor community.*  Does anyone know?

If Lowenthal was talking about feedback from the userbase, this new position is a very welcome development!

I just hope he is aware of this forum and the calls from several posters for a more usable means of feedback and technical questions from the Tor user community.

Our attempted discussion in this forum of Roger's previous report

     https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-tor-trainings-dutch-and-belgian-police

may have played a positive role in arousing interest from the Dutch press:

> Apparently when I pointed out that *some [Dutch police] regretted breaking into a Tor hidden service and erasing [the server]*, it caused quite a stir -- not that anybody is actually disputing the \"it didn't work\" conclusion as far as I can tell. I'm trying to use it to make people in the Netherlands communicate with each other; here's how I answered one Dutch journalist who wanted to interview me: \"You're welcome to use what I wrote in the blog post. *Hopefully it will be useful for starting a discussion*. I really think the discussion should be between Dutch citizens and their government though -- I don't want to be the imperialist American coming in and getting into the middle of it.\"

I appreciate that he recognizes that there is a legitimate need to discuss such issues, with a reasonable diversity of views being allowed.  Law enforcement never has any problem airing *their* views, often using a \"friendly\" reporter as a mouthpiece.  The problem is that ordinary citizens who desire anonymity have a much harder time finding a forum willing to let them make their own arguments.
