I agree about your first point - far too easy to hit by accident where it is... and beside the terminal icon would be a huge improvement.

Completely disagree with the second idea... adding a swathe of mindless \"what do you really want to do\" and \"are you absolutely certain that you meant to click on that last button\" messages would (1) be astoundingly irritating, (2) necessitate a \"panic button - which would have the same \"problem\" and (3) what the hell else do yo expect a swap-free, memory-wiping live CD to offer? Hibernate?

If you can't figure out that the big red button marked with the international \"power\" symbol will turn off the machine, you probably shouldn't be using a computer.
