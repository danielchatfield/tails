This is a know issue, and I think the way described on [[todo/better_power_off_button]] would make everyone happy, isn't it?

> If you can't figure out that the big red button marked with the international \"power\" symbol will turn off the machine, you probably shouldn't be using a computer.

I don't think this has anything to do with \"should be using a computer\" or \"shouldn't be using a computer\". I'd like this forum to be a bit more welcoming to beginners.
