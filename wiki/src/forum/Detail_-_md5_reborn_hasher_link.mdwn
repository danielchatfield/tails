hi.
the link in the new documentation for md5 reborn hasher had not been upgraded and pointed to the now defunct/missing check it.

https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/verify_the_iso_image_using_other_operating_systems/index.en.html

perhaps this is due to ikiwiki internals or simple distraction, but I fixed this minor detail.

Question here is, (I am not wiki savvy) am I free to correct errors in tails wiki? Is everyone free to do so?
