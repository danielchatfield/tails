Some people say the following:

\" VPN server. It decrypts your data and can potentially read it all. That's the point\"

\"What is the best way to stay anonymous? i'm using Tor right now and it seems my data is being compromises between my ISP and destination. else, maybe at Tor nodes in the network.\"

Read about \"Weaknesses\" that Tor has on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)#Weaknesses

Read about Dan Egerstad revelation on Monitor Tor exit nodes:

\"In September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed that he had intercepted usernames and passwords for a large number of email accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes.[26] As Tor does not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture any traffic passing through it which does not use end-to-end encryption such as TLS. While this may or may not inherently violate the anonymity of the source if users mistake Tor's anonymity for end-to-end encryption they may be subject to additional risk of data interception by self-selected third parties.[27] (The operator of any network carrying unencrypted traffic, such as the operator of a wi-fi hotspot or corporate network, has the same ability to intercept traffic as a Tor exit operator. End-to-end encrypted connections should be used if such interception is a concern.) Even without end-to-end encryption, Tor provides confidentiality against these local observers which may be more likely to have interest in the traffic of users on their network than arbitrary Tor exit operators\"

\"VPN over Tor works. Note the difference from using VPN to access Tor!\"

Someone said in a forum the following:

\"The correct path of your config is: PC (OpenVPN with proxy) -> TOR entry -> TOR exit -> VPN server -> SSH server
There should be no need to torify anything. Every application should transparently use VPN over TOR (thanks to OpenVPN proxy features). Furthermore, UDP traffic now can go through TOR (it's TCP over UDP, done by OpenVPN)!

In this way:
- SSH server sees VPN server IP address
- VPN server sees TOR exit node IP address
- VPN server sees SSH encrypted traffic
- TOR servers see OpenVPN+SSH encrypted traffic

The packets which finally go out have the SSH server IP address on their header. \"

------------------

Finally, we have to find THE best solution to have a reasonable fast Tor browsing secure ((HTTPS) or other ) & anonymous experience while in the same time neither the ISP or websites know your using the Tor network and you have added layers etc...

Also, we have to solutions so that no ISP be able to block Tor at any given time.
The normal \"joe the plumber\" has to know how to bypass this restriction if possible without ISP knowing anything at all about any Tor connection.


Anyone with THE best solution ?
