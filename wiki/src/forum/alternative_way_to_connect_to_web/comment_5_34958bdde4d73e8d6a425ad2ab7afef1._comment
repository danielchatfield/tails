I went ahead and tried me>ISP>proxy>bridge>Tor>web. However, this seems to make the internet unusable. One of those usability vs security things. I'm having issues connecting to the Tor network at all. I cannot get the whole Tor directory. A few times I did, but even so the pages loaded so slow I would sit there for hours. Any help? How can I have both usability and security here.
