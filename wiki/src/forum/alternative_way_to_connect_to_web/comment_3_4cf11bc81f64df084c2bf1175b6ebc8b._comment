Find a good & trustable VPN rather than a proxy

-which is outside U.S.
-which doesn't keep any log

I'm using one of them. it's really nice

right now:
Me -> VPN ->  Tor -> Tails website

all of the hops are encrypted, Tor anonymizes me, VPN doesn't keep logs about me. But be careful about which VPN provider you are using
