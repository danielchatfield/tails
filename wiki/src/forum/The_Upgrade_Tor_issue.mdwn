The "Upgrade Tor" issue is bit repetetive since many use TAILS from USB or CD.

Having the files needed to upgrade Tor or other files available locally will save time for most users.

Is it possible to post the links of the needed files (so they can be downloaded and placed in the same USB or at some partition) and the script (or command) to install them from that location? 

This will save ~ 10 to 15 min of time depending on the download speed.

Thnx
