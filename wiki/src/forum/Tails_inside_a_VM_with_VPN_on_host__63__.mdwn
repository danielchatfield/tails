Hi.

Would it be safe to assume a good method to prevent ISP's ever getting a hold of the fact that I use tails is to enable a VPN on my host then within a virtual box boot tails?

Would there be any conflicts to this method?

Please don't link me to the tail VPN support. I'm afraid I don't quite understand it. If you would be so kind to explain why or why not this is a good method, I would much appreciate the time.

Regards.
