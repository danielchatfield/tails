Hi.

I guess it *does* save the configuration, but the next instance of iceweasel does not use it as it's overriden by `/etc/iceweasel/profile/user.js`. We put the configuration in there (as opposed to `/etc/iceweasel/pref/iceweasel.js`) because (the Git log reads) *Else it does not seem to be fully taken into account*.

If someone wants to investigate deeper, s/he should confirm my guess, and if I'm right, try to put everything in `pref/iceweasel.js` except what really needs to be put into `profile/user.js` (try/error with a brand new profile on every try).
