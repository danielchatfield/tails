When using Tails, Iceweasel does not connect to https://check.torproject.org but it does connect well to other sites like google.com and tails.boum.org.

What can be the problem here? Is it possible that check.torproject is down or temporarily unavailable?

Is the check really necessary to know that I'm really connected to Tor?

Thanks all for any input on this.
