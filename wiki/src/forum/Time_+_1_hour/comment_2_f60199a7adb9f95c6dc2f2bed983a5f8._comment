you are reading it wrong, to use .onion  services you must have a clock that is in synced with the clock the .onion services uses, TOR uses GMT as its chosen timezone and therefore your clock will always be synchronized to GMT, so the reason why your clock is always adjusted ahead one hour is that you live somewhere were the timezone is GMT-1.
