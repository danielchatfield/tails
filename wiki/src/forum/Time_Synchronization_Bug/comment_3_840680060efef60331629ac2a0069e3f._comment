> Apparently this bug is the reason why the current release of TAILS can't connect to the internet on this machine over a wireless network.

Care to elaborate? I don't think time has anything to do with the ability to use wireless networks.

In any case, if the time difference you see is due to what I explained (UTC vs your local time zone) this is not a bug, and the time Tails has is in fact correct. For instance, check [this site](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=1440) for the current time in UTC. Is it the same as what you see in Tails? If so, there's no bug.
