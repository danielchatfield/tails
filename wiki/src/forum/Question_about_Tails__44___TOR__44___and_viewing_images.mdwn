Newbie Question: My sincere thanks for any help you can give concerning the following two questions!:
If I use TOR running within a Tails operating system loaded on a USB plugged into my PC at home, and ONLY VIEW documents and images (NO downloading!), am I leaving ANY trace of my viewing on my home PC? One other question...would I be susceptible to "exit node snooping" where someone running an exit node could actually find my true IP and link it to my viewing of documents or images?
Thanks so much for your help!
