>TLDR The two projects have different attack points - with Tails, the user loses if malware gains root. With Whonix, the user loses if the hypervisor is compromised.

In order to remove any bias, suppose you are not a Tails developer.

Which of the two: Tails or Whonix, do you think is more robust against malware attacks? I mean: gaining root access is more difficult or compromising the hypervisor is more difficult?
