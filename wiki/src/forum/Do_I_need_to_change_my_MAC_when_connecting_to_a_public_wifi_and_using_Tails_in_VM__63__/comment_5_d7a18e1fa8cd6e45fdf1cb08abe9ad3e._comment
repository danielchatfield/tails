> I don't trust that both the host OS and the virtualization software can provide the same level of anonymity as Tail does.

They don't. The OS and VM system add to the de-anonymization attack surface.
That said, users making an informed decision about acceptable risk and choosing to use Tails under a VM should not be prohibited from also using persistence. As it stands now, even if one uses a CD/DVD or USB drive to boot Tails into a VM persistence options are disabled. I would like to know how to enable that option.
