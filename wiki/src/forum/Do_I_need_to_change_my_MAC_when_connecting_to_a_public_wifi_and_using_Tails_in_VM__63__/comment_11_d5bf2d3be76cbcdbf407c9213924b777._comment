> In order to remove any bias, suppose you are not a Tails developer.

Given Tails posts as 'Tails' and that the comments in this thread have been anonymous, I think that should be an implicit assumption. 

> Which of the two: Tails or Whonix, do you think is more robust against malware attacks? I mean: gaining root access is more difficult or compromising the hypervisor is more difficult?

Looking at lists of published vulnerabilities, privilege escalation exploits (ie: gaining root) are far more common than hypervisor attacks. A naive interpretation of the data would indicate that Whonix is more secure.

There are many other factors to consider. Among them that are important to me personally:

* how big is the userbase for each tool ?
    * in general more users = more audits = more security 
    * how large is the development team, and support for each tool ?
* how hard is the tool to set up ? 
    * I am not comfortable taking responsibility for securing systems in the manner provided by both systems and wish to minimize the chance of error.
* does it do what I want ?
    * I am not as concerned about malware infecting my system as I am about surveillance.
    

I am glad that both projects exists and appreciate the efforts of everyone working to protect privacy and anonymity on the internet.
