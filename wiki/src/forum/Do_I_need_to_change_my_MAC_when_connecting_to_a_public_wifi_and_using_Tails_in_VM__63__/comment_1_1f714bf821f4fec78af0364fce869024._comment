Your MAC address is the address of your network card at the ethernet layer, so even if you spoof the MAC in your VM it won't matter; it's your laptop's network card that is connecting to the router.

You could change it in your OS but I don't really see why you'd want to do that unless you're massively paranoid. You connected to a WiFi hotspot and connected to Tor because you are serious about your privacy, whatever happened next cannot be proved by anyone.
