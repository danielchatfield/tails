Thanks for this discussion, I've had the same concerns myself about Wifi Networks and MITM attacks from ISPs monitoring TOR exit nodes. The way I understand it, without using HTTPS, any traffic from a TOR node is decrypted before it exits TOR. So if someone is monitoring a TOR node on a public Wifi, they can easily sniff the data for specific words filenames whatever... probably save it all to a folder... certainly the ISP could... all they would know, however, is that someone sent this info to/from a TOR node at a specific day/time, but not WHO sent it... unless you give out that information yourself...so on the one hand, on a public Wifi you're totally anonymous because you don't have an ISP account for someone to trace back to you specifically... but on the other hand, whatever info you send/receive is decrypted and can easily be monitored / saved.

The best would be HTTPS on a public network. You're totally anonymous and your data stream is encrypted. Still, public networks are open to 'sidejacking' (or whatever the term is), so you have to make sure you don't use any accts someone can compromise and get your information. So using a dedicated computer only for Tor use on a public Wifi is a really good idea.

IMO, all Tor entry nodes should use HTTPS / SSL or something, even if TOR has to become it's own CA for the system to work... or TOR / Linux should come up with their own system, maybe implemented through Vadalia or something...(kind of like how torrent programs do it)
