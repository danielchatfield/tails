@comment #8, from a TAILS dev:

I am the author of comment # 7 and I wanted to take a moment to thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed and thorough reply to my inquiries. It is greatly appreciated. 

I still have many questions...and a lot to learn...so I hope to yet come back to this at some point. I hope this and many of the other threads here will be moved to the new forum that is planned.
