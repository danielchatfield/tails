First, doesn't your second paragraph above contradict your first?

Second, I am a bit perplexed at the way both the TAILS as well as the Tor developers suggest the use of SSL/HTTPS (and the HTTPS Everywhere add-on) as an easy, practical and reasonably effective way of protecting oneself against hostile packet injection and MITM. 

For starters, because of the seeming contradiction that I pointed out just above, i.e., the risk of malicious/compromised Tor exits/WiFi honeypots.

But even if this were not a considerable risk, there is the issue of simple *usability/functionality*. Let us consider, for a moment, the reason given for *JavaScript* being enabled globally in the default configuration of both TAILS as well as Tor Browser Bundle: That disabling all JavaScript by default would prove too problematic for the typical user (or at least many users) because of how many web sites they would find broken (and not know how to fix).

Now, consider the relatively few number of web sites that support HTTPS encryption for anything other than commerce, and there would seem to be a problem here. Are the TAILS and Tor devs actually suggesting that (absent a trusted VPN, at least) Tor only be used for those relatively few web sites that fully support HTTPS? If so, it seems to me that this should be made clearer in the relevant documentation.

Also, am I recalling/understanding from a previous post by a TAILS dev correctly that any .onion site basically provides the same protection as an HTTPS site?

As always, the efforts of everyone involved in these projects is much appreciated.
