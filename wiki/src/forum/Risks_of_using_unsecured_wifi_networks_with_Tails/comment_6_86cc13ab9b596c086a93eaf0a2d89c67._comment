> can a hacker also read out the ID's of all the connected devices like the serial number of my motherboard, connected USB-drives, monitor etc. while connected to the LAN network with Tails?

No. In order to do that an attacker must completely compromise your system.

> Is the LAN connection between my computer and the router encrypted by Tails/Tor? Is that for all the external connections when using Tails?

All Internet traffic is routed through the Tor network and is hence encrypted and authenticated.

> If so, it is surely difficult to break into the computer and read out the hardware. In that case I don't have to worry much that someone infects my computer only by being connected to the unsecured LAN network?

That's correct.
