Thank you for your reactions!

\"For this reason it may be a good idea to spoof your MAC address.\" 

Of course spoofing MAC is a must because otherwise they will see directly the original MAC address in the router, but can a hacker also read out the ID's of all the connected devices like the serial number of my motherboard, connected USB-drives, monitor etc. while connected to the LAN network with Tails? 

Is the LAN connection between my computer and the router encrypted by Tails/Tor? Is that for all the external connections when using Tails?  If so, it is surely difficult to break into the computer and read out the hardware. In that case I don't have to worry much that someone infects my computer only by being connected to the unsecured LAN network?
