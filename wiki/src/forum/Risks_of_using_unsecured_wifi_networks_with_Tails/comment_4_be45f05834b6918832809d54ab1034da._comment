> Are there still digital risks / ways to link me to the hardware I have at home.

Yes. Just like there can be no such thing as perfect security in the real world, Tor isn't perfect. Security is about making it expensive for your adversaries to attack you.

> Can a hacker/ISP read my hardware while being connected to a unsecured network?

They can only see your NICs MAC address, which you can spoof (will be supported in Tails [[soon|todo/macchanger]]).

> Imagining when they first would read out my hardware (for example serial number of my motherboard, monitor, connected USB-devices, the permanent hard coded MAC of my network card etc.) and afterwards they do a physical house search in the near area of the router that sends out the wifi signal I'm using, they will find those hardware in my house.

For this reason it may be a good idea to spoof your MAC address.

> Can they also, while I'm connected to a unsecured network, see the destination of my Tor-surfing when using Iceweasel? Or is that well encrypted and difficult to decrypt/see?

They have to break Tor, which has pretty good crypto.

> How good/reliable is the firewall in Tails then? Does anoyone know that?

Due to the lack of services listening on the network, and the firewall, an attacker on the LAN is limited to try to intercept and modify Tails' outgoing connections. All outgoing connections are run through Tor, and so are encrypted and authenticated, so the attacker has to break Tor's crypto to be able to do anything, which is highly unlikely.

Well, there's an important exception: Tails allow non-Torified connections over the LAN. It's possible to exploit this if the attacker on your LAN also runs an exit node: In each html file the attacker's exit node sends *back* through Tor it injects an image hosted on the IP address it has on the LAN. If you happen to use that exit, the attacker will then learn all non-HTTPS websites you visit *while using that particular exit*. This shows the importance of using end-to-end encryption and authentication as provided by HTTPS, for instance.

On the other hand, in the above situation the attacker can see the timing of the packets you send to Tor (which it can even on an encrypted wireless network) **and** it controls your exit. This means you're screwed no matter what. The attacker can just do a traffic confirmation attack based on the timings of all packets it sees on the LAN and the timings of all the packets it receives on its exit node, which is easy and bulletproof.

> 100% security doesn't exist?

Exactly.
