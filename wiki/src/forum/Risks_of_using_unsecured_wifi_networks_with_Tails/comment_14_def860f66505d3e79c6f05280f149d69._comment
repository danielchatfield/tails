First, thank you for producing Tails!

May I suggest that you give people a boot option to randomize all MAC addresses on startup?

I realize that automatically randomizing MAC addresses presents problems for some people, but if it was a boot option, at least people could choose.

This would prevent the problems that people are experiencing with macchanger and not being able to connect to a wireless network after using macchanger. Plus, this would prevent the original wireless MAC address from being leaked.
