Almost, and that's why I started the second paragraph with \"On the other hand ...\".

HTTPS *is* a good protection against \"hostile packet injection and MITM\". The problem as far as HTTPS goes is the weak trust model in the CA system commonly used for validating the certificates. We (Tails developers) are not actively promoting the CA system as something good. Unfortunately our own website uses a certificate we bought from the CA mafia, but please don't interpret that as support from our side. There's simply no good, **widely-deployed** alternative, so we'd scare off new users if we used e.g. a self-signed certificate and depended on people using e.g. [Monkeysphere](https://web.monkeysphere.info/) or [Convergence](http://convergence.io/) (for the record, we used a [CACert.org](https://www.cacert.org/)-signed certificate before, but that was enough to generate ~10 \"is your site MITM:ed?\" question per month for us).

As it stands, HTTPS with the CA system is better than no authentication, but when it really matters one should take extra precautions (e.g. manual fingerprint verification or Monkeysphere or Convergence, etc.).

I cannot speak for the Tor developers, but I can link to an aricle where they explicitly say that they think [the CA model is flawed](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it).

> Now, consider the relatively few number of web sites that support HTTPS encryption for anything other than commerce, and there would seem to be a problem here. Are the TAILS and Tor devs actually suggesting that (absent a trusted VPN, at least) Tor only be used for those relatively few web sites that fully support HTTPS? If so, it seems to me that this should be made clearer in the relevant documentation.

I was not saying that you should use HTTPS for the sole reasons to protect against the \"injection-based end-to-end confirmation attack\" I described in my \"second paragraph\". HTTPS is a good way to authenticate your end-points (at least if used with care), and for keeping sensititive data away from snooping ISPs and exits. The whole point of describing that attack was to show that it's enough to simply observe traffic on both ends to break Tor; neither HTTPS, \"trusted VPNs\" nor trying to block LAN connections are solutions to prevent such attacks. Tor isn't designed to protect against confirmation attacks (it's an open research problem if that's even possible in some practical way for low-latency anonymity networks like Tor).

I'm curious why you mention \"trusted VPNs\" as some sort of solution in the parenthesis:

1. VPNs do nothing against end-to-end timing confirmation attacks.
2. VPNs do not protect against the injection-and-attacker-on-the-LAN attack. Your LAN is still accessible when using a VPNs. Well, some VPNs may push you routes that break that, but that's not the norm. In any case, blocking LAN access is better handled by a firewall.

True, if your VPN is truly trusted, it helps a bit with 2 if you access the VPN through Tor, since that removes the MITM opportunity from all Exit nodes. But it's not only exits that can MITM. Also, generally you'd have to be in control of or personally know the operators of a VPN to have good reasons to trust it, and that doesn't mix well with anonymity. Even so, no matter what, attack 1 is better than 2, so there's little point in making a huge effort trying to protect against attack 2.

In general, VPNs are hyped, both when used alone (e.g. no distributed trust) and together with Tor (but there are [[some valid uses of VPNs + Tor|todo/vpn_support]]).

> Also, am I recalling/understanding from a previous post by a TAILS dev correctly that any .onion site basically provides the same protection as an HTTPS site?

It completely depends on the rest of the context, because in general this is like comparting apples and oragnes. Also, note that the cryptographic strengty of the authentication for .onions [is pretty weak](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2010-August/000430.html). IMHO it's best to use Tor hidden services only for what it was designed for (location-hidden servers) and treat any other accidental crypto property as inadequate.
