Hi there,

If I want to update what the live USB I'd installed the previous version (ie. Tails 0.8). Does it mean I have to erase all the content on the USB stick? Update the new version will erase all the partion on the USB, right?

Or maybe there's a solution to just update the Tails but would not have to erase all the partion.

Thanks for reading, I thought this seems kinda silly quuetion.

cheers
