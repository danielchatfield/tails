> Time syncing does not always work perfectly

Please send us [[two complete bug reports|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]]: one
bug report after time syncing works, and another one (after rebooting) when it
does not.

> Once Tor is up and running how do I make sure my system clock is set to the
> correct time?

By helping us fix the bug :)

> What time should it be set to?

Current time, UTC.

> How do I set it to the Tor concensus time or whatever time it is supposed to be set to

See `date(1)`.

> Can/should I use the /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-time.sh script to
> auto-sync to the correct time?

Running this kind of \"internal\" scripts by hand is not supported, but if you
read the design doc about time sync'ing carefully and understand the script
well, you might manage to use it nonetheless without shooting yourself in
the foot.

> Should I edit the timeout in 20-time.sh and make it longer, before I plug in
> the network cable?

This could be worth a try. Please report back.
