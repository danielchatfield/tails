making the above folder persistent doesn't work

also, \"/home/amnesia/.gconf/system/desktop/gnome/peripherals/\" doesn't work either.

Both dirs have files created with the desired settings included, making these files persist doesn't have the desired effect though (the files persist but the mouse settings remain unchanged).

anyone?
