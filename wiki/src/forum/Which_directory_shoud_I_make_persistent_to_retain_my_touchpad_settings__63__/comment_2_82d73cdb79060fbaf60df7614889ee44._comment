the button works intermittently if I press very hard on one particular point near the corner. Before the tails greeter was introduced in 0.11 I would just navigate with the keyboard except for one necessary click-hold-and-release to open the menu (system>preferences>mouse) and then change the mouse settings with the keyboard.

the new greeter is too complex for this so I have to use a usb mouse (with broken right click of course). I'm hoping that a persistent mouse setting will make the process less of a pain for me.

I have read previous posts mentioning this left button problem before and it seems to be a common one so I am surprised it hasn't been picked up yet - on lots of old laptops, the left click button is the first to go.

More user friendly defaults would be:

disable touchhpad when typing - check
enable mouse clicks with touchpad - check
two-finger scrolling - check

and personally I like two finger horizontal scrolling but I'm not ssure if that's a common setting or not.


I will file a report, but until then if anyone knows which file or directory is changed by the mouse settings GUI I would be grateful if they could share it.


thankyou very much
