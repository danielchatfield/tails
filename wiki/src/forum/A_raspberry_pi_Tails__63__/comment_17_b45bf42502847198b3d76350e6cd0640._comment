debian has a good arm port(s), and tails is based on debian.


I'm not sure how they're CD creation tool works, but a good start would be getting a list of packages from tails

dpkg -l > packagelist.txt

then transfering the packagelist.txt to removable media.

then you'd need to figure out where all the tails specific scripts and configs are stored, copy all of them to a removable disk.

Now use the same debian CD creator tool tails does and re-assemble everything on an arm-based install.
