It seems there is at least one Debian-based distribution for this device:

<http://elinux.org/RPi_Distributions>

It would be great if enough of Tails could somehow be ported to that so that anyone who owns some rasberry pi's could set up and run a Tor middle node or bridge which does no logging and does that one thing only (so no big deal if seized).

I am not sure this is technically feasible due to memory constraints, but might be worth pursing if it seems possible that such a scheme could be made to work.
