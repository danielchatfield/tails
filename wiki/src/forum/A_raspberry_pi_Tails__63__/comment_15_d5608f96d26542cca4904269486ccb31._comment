After reading the PDF at the raspberry pi org, it seems that for the crucial step of loading the raspian Wheezy-based distro onto the SD card, you need to be using Windows and to have even installed some particular item of software.  Or is there a workaround for Linux users who want to put raspbian on a 4GB SD card?
