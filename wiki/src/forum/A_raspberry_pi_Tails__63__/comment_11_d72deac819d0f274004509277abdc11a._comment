Switching to XFCE would save a lot of memory.

Messing with about:config on Iceweasel would help a lot, too. Namely to only remember 1-2 pages back or forget history altogether. If it's possible, one could create a single-use encrypted volume for Iceweasel to store data on the flash card at each boot & give it an extra 512MB \"swap\"-style ram.
