Well beyond my ability, but I might be able to find a Rasberry Pi and install raspbian, and report my experiences here.

Tails server is indeed interesting, but what do you think about this thought?

Linux is based on unix.  The motto of unix applictions is: do one thing, very well.

To me this motto suggests that there might be security/anonymity/usability/maintainability benefits to figuring out how to make minimal changes to raspbian to do one thing well: run a non-exit Tor node or bridge or even Exit Tor node, as the user chooses.
