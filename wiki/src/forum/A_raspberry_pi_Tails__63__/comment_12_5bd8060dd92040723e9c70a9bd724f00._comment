> If it's intended to donate bandwidth to TOR, one could simply install TOR and configure it as a relay/entry/bridge/exit node

I would like to run a middle node but have only a slow broadband connection.  But if it were easy for anyone to buy an inexpensive Rasberry Pi and to configure it as a Tor middle node, this might greatly increase the total number of middle nodes.   Enough to help the Tor community?
