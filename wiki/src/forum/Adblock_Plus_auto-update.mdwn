Is this OK?

Do we need auto-updates for Adblock Plus filters?

The config: <https://adblockplus.org/en/preferences#subscriptions_autoupdate>

Also what do you think about Ghostery? (Please test the latest 2.7.1 version) It's user interface is very nice, now you can easily select/deselect categories (Advertising, Analytics, Trackers, Widgets)

The best feature is you see all the bugs on every website, you can learn what are they used for and switch to block/unblock.

It's better to use it by unchecking Alert Bubble and the Add-on Bar
