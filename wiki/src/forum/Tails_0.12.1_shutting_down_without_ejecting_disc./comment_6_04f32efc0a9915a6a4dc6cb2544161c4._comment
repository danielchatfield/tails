I tried to use Whisper Back to submit my Bug Report but received a \"SMPT\" error and \"Network Failure\" warning. I tried to send it 3 times and even tried the \"New Identity\" feature but met with no success. Could you be kind enough to cut & paste this Bug Report to the proper location? TIA :)






Name of the affected software
-----------------------------
Tails 0.12.1

Exact steps to reproduce the problem
------------------------------------

During system shutdown Tails 0.12.1 does not auto eject the DVD from it's drive. I am unable to eject the disk manually at this time. System wipe seems to work and the system shuts down on it's own after wipe completes. System must be rebooted inorder to remove the Tails DVD from it's drive, during system restart.

Actual result / the problem
---------------------------

All previous versions I've used auto ejected the DVD/CD at the time of System \"Wipe\". Tails 0.12.1 does not perform this step.

Desired result
--------------

Auto ejection of the DVD during the shutdown phase.
