Please answer the question we asked to the OP, then :) ... and report a bug.

:) The computer shuts down after the wipe but does not eject the DVD nor does it allow for the DVD to eject by pressing the tray door ejection button. The system must be rebooted in order to extract the DVD at system start up. 0.12.1 is the only version I've used that this has been an issue. I'll follow up with a bug report and thanks again for your efforts. Tails is great!
