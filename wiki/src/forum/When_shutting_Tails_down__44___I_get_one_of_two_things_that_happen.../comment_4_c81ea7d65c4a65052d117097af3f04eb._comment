>If I were to shut down my PC and not just VirtualBox, wouldn't that completely clear my RAM?

I'm not a dev or anything but I am nearly certain that the answer is yes The only question is just how long it will take after shutting down before everything in the RAM is completely wiped. I don't recall what the outer limit is. Is it as much as 20 minutes?
