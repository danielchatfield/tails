Hi,

I just noticed that when writing an email with claws-mail, drafts are automatically saved in the folder 'Drafts', before the encryption.

While using imap, those emails are **saved on the server, plaintext**.

Of course Tails never pretend to avoid this, but it's good to know ;)

Workaround :

Desactivate "Automatically save messages to Drafts folder" in **Configuration > Preferences > Writing**
