>use it's --socks5 option to proxy it with Tor.

Would the following script be an example of such:

`curl --socks5-hostname \"127.0.0.1:9050\" --retry 10 '{URL of page containing images}' | grep -Pio '(?<=href=\\").+/src/.+(jpe?g|gif|png)(?=\\")' | sort -u | while read image; do curl --socks5-hostname \"127.0.0.1:9050\" --retry 10 -O \"$image\"; done`
 
?

I would have thought the socks stuff wasn't necessary in Tails, since Tails already routes all traffic through Tor?

FWIW, I ran the script in comment 2-- WITHOUT `socks5-hostname \"127.0.0.1:9050\"` -- and it executed succesfully (downloaded all the images at the specified URL) but I have no idea whether it leaked any info that could compromise my anonymity.
