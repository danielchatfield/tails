Hmm, curl has obviously been added to Tails at some point since 0.10. (I have just used curl in Tails 0.16)

But...is a script such as the following, used to download all images on a web page, minus thumbnails, SAFE to run in Tails:

`curl --retry 10 '{URL of page containing images}' | grep -Pio '(?<=href=\\").+/src/.+(jpe?g|gif|png)(?=\\")' | sort -u 		| while read image; do curl --retry 10 -O \"$image\"; done`

???
