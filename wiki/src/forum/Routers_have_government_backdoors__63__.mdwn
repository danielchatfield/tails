I have seen it claimed by some that routers normally have backdoors. This seems similar to how it is said that you can assume any commercial encryption has a backdoor. And I do. That's why I use open source. The problem is that my very large ISP mandates a specific custom router supplied by them, and I assume it is backdoored. But what does this mean, if anything, for Tails users and our security? Can they spy on us at will, or what?
