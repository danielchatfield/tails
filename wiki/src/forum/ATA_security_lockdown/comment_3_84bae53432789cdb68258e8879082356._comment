It is very true that the user has no way of validating the hardware crypto implementation. Vendors don't ship source code of the firmware, and as even if they did, how could you validate the silicon part? In the end you also need to trust your CPU chip not to have backdoors in it.

I believe there are some FIPS 140-2 certified disks on the market, but even that is in the \"do you trust the government_\" territory. Intel basically just publishes one document (Order no 325514-001US) describing their FDE implementation for the 320/520 series SSDs, and it really does not give much detail. At least it says no key material is stored on the device in clear text. Intel and NDA is likely able to crack it, but I don't think it is nowhere near as trivial as cracking the standard non-encrypting ATA passwords (if you have physical access).

Well, what prevents the attacker from inserting the drivers as a kernel module if she has pwned your box? Still, I think leaving HDD drivers out from the standard kernel would be a good idea.

In the long run, I'd really like to see Tails having a built-in and ready configured virtualization layer that would hide all the details (model, serial numbers, MACs, etc.) about the physical hardware. Now even the unprivileged user (amnesia) can dig out too much information about the hardware.
