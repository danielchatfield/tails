@5 Thanks. No mention there of preventing *access* though. Has anything along the lines of `nofixeddisks` ever made it out of the forum/mailing-list and into a more permanent page? Would \"Better internal hard disks lockdown\" be the place for such ideas?

Not always possible unfortunately... and even where it is *possible*, it's not necessarily a particularly good solution. Useful in some cases though, granted.
