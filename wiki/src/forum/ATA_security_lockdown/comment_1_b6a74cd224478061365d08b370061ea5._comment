>Most modern disks support ATA password protection. Only a handful of disks and SSDs use it for real full disk encryption, making the disk really secure even with physical access

On what information are you basing this? AFAIK many (most?) of these your-benevolent-HDD-manufacturer-has-done-the-crypto-for-you offerings fall squarely into the snake-oil category. Either (\"accidentally\") \"poorly implemented\" or (unashamedly) backdoored.

>Does anyone know how you can lock the hard disk in Tails (or Linux in general) before going on-line?

Perhaps you'd like to build your own Tails .ISO with the kernel's ATA/HDD drivers removed or remove those drivers from a USB installation? Search for more ;)
