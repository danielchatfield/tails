It does but you need to download an add-on and be using Firefox (and it appears there needs to be a workaround just to get it to work with the new Firefox). 7-zip could be an alternative since it's a common open source compression program for Windows. I believe it's used to unpack the Tor Browser Bundle (self-extracting archive), so there seems to be some trust in it from the developers of Tor.
