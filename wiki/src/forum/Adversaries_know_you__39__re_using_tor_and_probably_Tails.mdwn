By using Tails, you'd automatically be using Tor. Now, since my ISP sees my requests to the inital Tor node they can know for sure I am using Tor. Same holds true for the websites I access using Tor, because they get the page request from a Tor exit node.

So "They" know I am using Tor, but how can "They" know I am using Tails? 
Does Tails use Tails specific Tor nodes?
Or is it because of the way IceWeasel is configured? Do websites have the ability to tell between properly spoofed useragents and real useragent information?

Thanks.
