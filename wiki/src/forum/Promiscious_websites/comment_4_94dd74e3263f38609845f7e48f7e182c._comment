While using Tails:

* Clear your browser cache (in FF, Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Network -> Clear Now)
* surf to a site such as news.cnet.com
* disconnect from the LAN and type into the browser location pane about:cache
* click on each item to review the contents

Reconnect and repeat while using TBB, or a Knoppix live CD with a NoScript-free untorified FF, to compare the level of protection you recieve from using NoScript, AdBlock Plus, and a stringent FF configuration.

Tweak your NoScript and try again.  Install AdBlock Plus and compare the blocked scripts it lists with what you find in your browser cache.

You'll see enough cookies to last for a week, more if you didn't disable cookies storage.  You may notice that some banners are loaded from a third party server.  You will probably find some 1x1 invisble gifs. You are almost sure to see plenty of E-tags.  You will find irrefutable evidence that in order to load one webpage, your browser was instructed to quietly contact a half dozen or more external adware sites.

If you do this more than once or twice a month, you are likely to catch one of the adware companies doing much worse, which they refer to euphemistically as \"validation\" of their evil tracking schemes.  What that means is that every now and then, to check that a particular \"anonymous\" user whom they have been tracking across websites is in fact the person who they think it is, they'll try to trick your browser into emailing them the domain name of your ISP and your username with that ISP, or even your IP address.  Ought to be illegal, but is a very common practice by many \"legit\" adware companies.  

Of course the adware vendors claim that they do not share your real identity with their e-marketing customers interested in \"demographics\", only \"aggregated\" data, and that they only do this nasty stuff so that they can tell their customers (advertisers) that they have ways of knowing with certainly the identities of each websurfer, which is after all what they are selling to the databrokers: in two broad categories of \"products\":

* detailed knowledge about everyone's business and browsing habits, supposedly with only your real name deleted from your browsing logs
* aggregated information describing in great detail microdemographic \"segments\", paired with lists of contact information of everyone classified in that segment.

That's what they mean by \"protecting\" our privacy.  It's utter rot since the information brokers can easily correlate the two types of information they buy from the adware vendors, to create detailed dossiers on each individual. 

And who are the customers of the data brokers?  Big banks, of course, big retail firms, of course, Insurance brokers, of course, but also your government.  If you live in the US, the IRS, ICE, FBI are all big consumers of Big Data bought from data brokers.

Welcome to Big Data.

More reason why everyone should use at least one of TBB or Tails for all their routine web-browsing.
