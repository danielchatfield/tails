In IceWeasel 10.0.11 (Tails 0.15):

Tools>Add-ons>Extensions:

Double click on 'amnesia branding' and notice it is updated with every new launch of the Tails live session.

In addition, at the top right within the 'amnesia branding' section selected, there is a small rectangle button with a search field to the right of it, click the small button and 'Update Add-ons Automatically' is checked. It must be manually disabled. (Torbutton may prevent updates to Extensions, but this feature should be disabled within the above mentioned section in IW)

With the amnesia branding you have no choice - it shows it is updated with the current date.

...are these two issues resolved in 0.16?
