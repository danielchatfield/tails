If I recall correctly, that is not problem with tails, that is problem with graphic driver (open source) so only chance to boot it is using \"nomodeset\". I also have this problem with many distributions, like ubuntu, mint, liberte and so on.
I know that there is no solution to bypass \"nomodeset\", but is there any solution to put native (or at least, wide-screen) resolution?
The part with \"something-man.something\" I didnt understand, but I found something like
live-config.xorg-resolution=XORG_RESOLUTION and I tried to put after \"=\" my native resolution in boot options, but it didnt work. :(

sorry for bad English :(
