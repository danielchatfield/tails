Once the screen goes black, please try pressing `Shift` or another key. I've seen laptops screen go to some kind of standby mode at this very time.

If this does not work, please try adding `xorg-driver=vesa` to the kernel commandline (press TAB in language selection boot menu, then SPACE, then the suggested parameter).
