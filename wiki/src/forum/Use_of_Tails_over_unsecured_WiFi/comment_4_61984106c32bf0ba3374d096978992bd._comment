[ph]

From an operational point of view I am not very pleased with open (read: unprotected wifi).

* my connection can be sniffed, wireless. They do not even have to unplug a wired connection, or reconfigure a router
* it seems possible to execute an ARP spoofing and inject request to access a website \"outside\" Tor (in concept / need additional research)
* on large commercial wifi hotspots in - say - airorts, trainstations, coffee shops, \"the local burger\" there might be CCTV
