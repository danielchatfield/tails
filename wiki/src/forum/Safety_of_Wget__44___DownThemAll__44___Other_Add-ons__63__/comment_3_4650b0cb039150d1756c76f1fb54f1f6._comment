I have the same questions...

Does anyone know how safe \"DownThemAll\" or any other download managers are to use with TAILS (or Tor Browser Bundle, for that matter)?

Anyplace to find step-by-step, easy to understand instructions for safely using Wget and/or Httracks to download content from sites for later offline viewing?

Thanks.
