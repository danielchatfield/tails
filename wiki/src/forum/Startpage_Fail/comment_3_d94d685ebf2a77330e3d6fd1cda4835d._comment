First, thanks for the switich to ixquick/startpage. They deserve the attention.

I experimented a few more times. The New Identity does not work if - after changing the identity - I click in the search bar again, no matter how many times I try it. However, it appears to work after putting the curser in the address bar and hitting enter.

So maybe the search bar doesn't know the identity changed and the address bar does?

And what do you think of the firefox proxy solution? Safe as standard procedure to take some weight off the Onion? Or is the Onion better with more people using it? Surfing through startpage/ixquick is faster.
