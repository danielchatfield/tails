comment 5, have you tried the other site, ixquick.com? I've found it has more rsults and often stuff google can miss.

BTW, do you ever get the startpage.com notice above because it doesn't connect? The reason for asking is becuause my Windows system is now saying the startpage certificates are bad and connection through SSL fails.
