Newbie here :) can someone please be kind enough to explain in detail how to set up tails start to finsih step by step. Including what materials (brand) etc. Including what downloads are needed like pgp, dvd burning downloads etc. for windows xp and 7. I'm assuming the dvd is the safest way to go. I think this would help me and many others. A complete walkthrough of the best wy to do it that explains everything. Thanks in advance :)
