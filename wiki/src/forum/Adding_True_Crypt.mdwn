Ok so this is what I want to do. 

I want to add True Crypt to the applications of TAILS so that I don't have to run it from the executable every time I want to use it. 

Currently I plug in the TAILS drive, enter my persistent PW, then set an Admin PW, then go and click the TrueCrypt exe, then accept the usage agreement, then setup the program, then run the program from the applications menu.

Isn't there a way to add this program package, so it is already onboard my TAILS drive and ready to use when I start it up?
