Hello, I have a question. I use Tails in virtual machine. I tried to monitor its network connections using host firewall and noticed it connects to ports 80 and 443. When I blocked them (temporarly) all the pages stopped loading.These ports are used for normal web-browsing, so I thought blocking them should not interfere with TOR. My question: does TOR use the 80 and 443 ports for its normal operations ?
