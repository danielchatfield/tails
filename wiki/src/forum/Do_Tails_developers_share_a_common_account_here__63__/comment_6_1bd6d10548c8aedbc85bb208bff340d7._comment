Emotional tone can be hard to read in a web forum, and my comment came in the context of some other threads where what I regard as gratuitious insults were issued.  If I mischaracterized the intentions of Commentator 1 in this thread, I apologize.

Let me rephrase:

> Shared identity might have been more accurate than \"shared account\" but... yes it's correct. More or less. So? It's A FORUM!!!!! What's the worst thing that could happen? One unidentified dev says something to embarrass the others?  Pull yourself together man!

In my opinion, it would be helpful to try tone down such language.  All that was really needed was to wait for \"Tails\" to confirm that \"Tails\" is indeed a shared account, which is all I wanted to know (and I didn't consider it necessary to state that I wanted to hear it from \"Tails\").
