Oh, and thanks for the additional links.  Simply getting the Tor version of this forum up and running would be enormously helpful to me.  Some of the issues mentioned in the ticket are similar to issues I raised, which suggests that there is a great deal of common ground between the kind of forums (threee) I'd like to see and the kind organizations like Tor Project may be willing to provide.

As I have tried to explain above, I follow the privacy/security news, human-rights and civil liberties issues, and have found (as does everyone like me, I think) that this requires also trying to stay abreast of international legal developments.  A nightmarishly complex web indeed.  So I probably know better than most what a difficult problem it would be to set up and moderate a general privacy forum while fending off legal threats, attempted intrusions, DDOS, and possibly in the not very distant future, \"kinetic attacks\".  But I also know better than most how badly the world needs such a forum.

Setting up a Tor forum similar to this one is much easier, and I hope the Tor project moves ahead, subject to the same concerns I raised about the new Tails forum.
