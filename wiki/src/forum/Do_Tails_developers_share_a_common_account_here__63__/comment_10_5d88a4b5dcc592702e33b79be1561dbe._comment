Please discuss issues you see about the Tor forum with the Tor
Project... and not only because this is off-topic here: it's
highly unlikely that discussing this topic *here* would have any
incidence on how they set it up.

I guess you want to participate in discussions that may result in
effective decisions, with people who will actually implement it.
Then, I strongly suggest raising such concerns on the tails-dev
mailing-list. In case it was not clear: no single Tails developer
reads this forum entirely.
