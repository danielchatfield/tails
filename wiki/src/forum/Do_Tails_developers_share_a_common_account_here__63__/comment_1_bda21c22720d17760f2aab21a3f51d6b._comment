>>You seem to think that \"Tails\" (the eponymous source of many forum posts) is an individual. It's the signature to posts from the developers' shared account.

>Is that true? Because if so, isn't sharing a common user account a classic failure mode from the viewpoint of network security?

Shared *identity* might have been more accurate than \"shared account\" but... yes it's correct. More or less. So? It's **A FORUM**!!!!! What's the worst thing that could happen? One unidentified dev says something to embarrass the others?

Pull yourself together man!

If you use the \"search box\" provided for you convenience at the upper right corner of every page, you'll find plenty of occurrences of \"Tails\" pointing this out.
