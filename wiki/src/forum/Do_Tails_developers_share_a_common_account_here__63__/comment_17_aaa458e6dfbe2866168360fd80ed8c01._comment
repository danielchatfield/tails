I am sure about that. NOT.

You make it sound so theatrical.

[hidden wiki](http://3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion/hiddenwiki/index.php/Main_Page) still online.

hack bb biggest fraud forum still online. what happens to me if they seize the admin? nothing. what happens if the feds take over the server? nothing actually i expect it to be run by the feds already. i am not involved into carding i am just enjoying the show. know what hackers know. know what they are talking about.

Onionforum 2.0 still online.

Silk road the biggest place to buy drugs online not that I like it but they demonstrate that Tor is safe. oh yes people using pseudonymous accounts doing illegal things and are still free.

Various other onion forum with or without registration users are still free. 

THIS IS THE POINT OF TOR. Get it? It lets anyone become anonymous good or bad guys. If it wouldn't let your register an account if it wouldn't let you use mailing list anonymously it would be totally broken.

> But I also know better than most how badly the world needs such a forum.

If world needs it so urgently it would already exist.
