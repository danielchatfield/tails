Insults are not helpful to anyone.

@ Tails:

Thanks for the link.  I don't think the ikiwiki is so awful that replacing it needs to be a high priority, and I will be excluded if you require registration to participate.  To the extent that discussions which you don't want to moderate here are impelling you towards another forum software, please consider helping to lobby the Tor Project to set up their own forum to make it easier for Tor users to anonymously ask questions and get them answered from more experienced users.

The references to things like \"email notification\" horrify me because this suggests that you will move to a forum software which requires registration in order to participate.  That means you will have not only IP connection logs which can be seized, but user account database which can potentially be exposed or seized.  Such possibilities will in my opinion prevent the people who most need to use Tails safely from being able to learn how to do that.  (I am thinking of people like political activists in Bahrain or one of the many other countries which are turning to increasingly alarming repressive methods in order to control their own population.)
