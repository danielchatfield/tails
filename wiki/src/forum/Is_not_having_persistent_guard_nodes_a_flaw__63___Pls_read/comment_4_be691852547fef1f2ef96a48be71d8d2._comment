> If Tor is less secure when started up with a fresh state, this is a problem with Tor, not with the package shipper.

The issue is not that Tor is insecure when started with a \"fresh state\", but when started *repeatedly* with a \"fresh state\". One issue is that with non-static first hops, the probability of a passive correlation attack will eventually become *1*. Static first hops (i.e. entry guards) will protect against this attack with probability *O((n-c)/n)*, where *n* is the total number of nodes in the network, and *c* is the number of compromised nodes. Another issue is that hidden services becomes much less hidden without entry guards.

For more, see the linked papers in the [Tor FAQ: What are Entry Guards?](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards)

> Liberté Linux has no persistence of entry guards. I also don't see any compelling reason to implement that (by, e.g., making /var/lib/tor/data persistent)

After skimming Paul Syverson's *[Locating Hidden Servers](http://www.onion-router.net/Publications/locating-hidden-servers.pdf)* I *really* think Liberté should make `/var/lib/tor` persistent to make cables communication safer. Of course, even without that the speed of the attack described in the paper would be limited by the number of reboots the Liberté user does, but still...
