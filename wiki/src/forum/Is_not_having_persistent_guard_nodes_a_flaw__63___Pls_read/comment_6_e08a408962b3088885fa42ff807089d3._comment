So I start up Tails & go to the Vidalia interface.  I select \"My ISP blocks connections to the Tor network\" & add the same bridge IP addresses I previously got from https://bridges.torproject.org.  

If I use the same bridges each time I start Tor isn't this, in effect, a form of persistent guard nodes?
