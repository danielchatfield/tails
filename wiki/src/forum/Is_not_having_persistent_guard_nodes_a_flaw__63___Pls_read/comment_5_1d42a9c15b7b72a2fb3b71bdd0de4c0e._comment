I am aware of the motivation behind entry guards, but I believe that this should be handled at the network level, and not by relying on certain usage patterns. For instance, [strict requirements](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-better-guard-rotation-parameters) for a relay to be able to serve as an entry guard (i.e., have a *Guard flag*) are a good start. Besides, this “we need to pick entry guards and stick to them” reeks too much of the usual academic knee-jerk reaction: someone (L. Øverlier and P. Syverson) publish a paper describing an attack → this must be fixed now, and let's wait for other research to discover problems with the employed fix. See [arma's comment](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-better-guard-rotation-parameters#comment-10565) about fingerprinting users by chosen entry guards, for instance. Why couldn't the Tor project employ some middle ground, by, e.g., assigning entry guards by user's IP address? Knee-jerk, I guess.

> I *really* think Liberté should make <tt>/var/lib/tor</tt> persistent to make cables communication safer.

But what about fingerprinting considerations above? Did the Tor people already decide which evil is the lesser one? I guess that <tt>/var/lib/tor/data</tt> can be made persistent, although that would probably ruin <tt>tordate</tt>-based time synchronization.
