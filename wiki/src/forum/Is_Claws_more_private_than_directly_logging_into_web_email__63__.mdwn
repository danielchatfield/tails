I woud post to a Claws forum if there were one. I have not used an email client. I have used web based email by directly logging into the web based email. For example, logging in at safe-mail.net. Would using Claws provide more privacy than directly logging into web based emails? If so, how?

I reviewed the Claws Manual and FAQ at claws-mail.org. I reviewed the instructions on safe-mail.net's help section on configuring email clients. Below is safe-mail's instructions. Claws is not working. Claws is not giving any error messages. I do not understand why Claws is not working. Could someone please give me instructions on each webpage of Claw's configuration?

I also have a fastmail.fm email account. It would also be very helpful to have specific instructions on setting Claws up with fastmail.fm. Thank you very much.
