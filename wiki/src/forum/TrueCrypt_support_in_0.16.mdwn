Hello. I am trying to mount a TrueCrypt volume in Tails v 0.16. According to documentation dated 2013-01-15. I should be able to include TrueCrypt support by: pressing [Tab] at the boot menu; pressing [Space]; typing 'TrueCrypt'; pressing [Enter]. Subsequently, according to the doc, I should be able to select TrueCrypt from the Applications|Accessories menu. I have done both steps. When I add "TrueCrypt" to the boot menu options, I receive neither a confirmation nor an error message. After Tails finishes loading and connecting, there is no "TrueCrypt" option on Applications|Accessories menu. The only possible user error that I can imagine is if the documentation is intended to indicate that I should erase the default boot options presented before typing [Space] TrueCrypt - I have pressed [Space] and typed TrueCrypt after the last option, "quiet_". Has TrueCrypt support been removed from 0.16? I did find discussion of removing TrueCrypt support, but assurances were given that an acceptable alternative would first be identified, and adequate deprecation notice would be given. What else could be causing this failure? Thanks.
