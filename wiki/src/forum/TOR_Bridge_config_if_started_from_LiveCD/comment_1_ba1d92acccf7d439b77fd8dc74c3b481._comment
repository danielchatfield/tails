You're mistaken. Tails doesn't automatically connect your machine to Tor upon boot. It does so on-demand, e.g. when you launch the \"safe browser\".

Perhaps you'd like to [read the manual](https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/index.en.html)?

Removing networking hardware is a means by which the paranoid can *ensure* that no networking is possible... it seems unnecessary for the situation you describe.
