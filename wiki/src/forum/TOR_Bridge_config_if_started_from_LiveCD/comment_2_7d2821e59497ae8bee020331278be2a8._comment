>As I understand, TAILS does - after booting the PC - immediately try to connect the TOR network and therefore my advisory does know that I am using TOR :-(

Who is \"my advisory\"?

Does he/she/it have access to your ISP and the ability to persecute for using tor?

If you don't wish to use the network it would be prudent to refrain from physically connecting to it.

If you wish to use the network but must insist on doing so without privacy/anonymity, you might be better off looking at other live distros. Ubuntu perhaps?
