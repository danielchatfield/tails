Don't worry, what you're trying to do is VERY simple. It's very wise of you to have decided to use the PGP key to cryptographically verify your downloads. Keep your copy of the signing key somewhere safe, e.g. on a flash drive. The more you use it, the more trustworthy it will become.

If this is the first time you've used the Tails signing key, you might like to review some excellent tips on ways to [establish *initial* trust in Tails signing key](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html)

Changing the signature's extension, as suggested by comment 1, should have added a \"verify\" option to the \"context menu\" your file manager offers when you right-click on the signature file. (you don't need to decrypt!)

If the GUI tools aren't working for you though, you could easily [verify from the command line](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/verify_the_iso_image_using_the_command_line/index.en.html)...

Don't panic! You only need to issue two commands!.. and you can skip the first one if you've already imported the key. If you'd like to have a crack at it, launch a \"terminal window\" then enter the following two commands (you'll need to alter the paths slightly to match where you saved the files on your computer. As you changed the extension on the signature file to .sig, you'll also have to change that on the second command - I've left it as the default \".pgp\" below, to avoid confusing others in the future):

First, to import the signing key, enter:

    cat /home/yourName/Downloads/tails-signing.key | gpg --keyid-format long --import

Then, to verify your Tails ISO file, enter:

    gpg --keyid-format long --verify /home/yourName/Downloads/tails-i386-0.14.iso.pgp /home/yourName/Downloads/tails-i386-0.14.iso

That's all there is to it!
