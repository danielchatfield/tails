Thanks for the answer, very helpful. I had to do the command line verification as I don't get 'verify' when I right click - Do you know how to set it so I get this in future as it'd be a lot easier.

Interestingly I had already imported the tails signing key into ubuntu 'passwords and keys' & gnupgshell so I just ran the second command & got:

gpg: Signature made Sun 11 Nov 2012 15:07:02 GMT
gpg:                using RSA key 1202821CBE2CD9C1
gpg: BAD signature from \"Tails developers (signing key) <tails@boum.org>\"

I went back & imported the signing key via the 1st command then re-ran the 2nd, verification, and got:

gpg: Signature made Sun 11 Nov 2012 15:07:02 GMT
gpg:                using RSA key 1202821CBE2CD9C1
gpg: Good signature from \"Tails developers (signing key) <tails@boum.org>\"
gpg:                 aka \"T(A)ILS developers (signing key) <amnesia@boum.org>\"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 0D24 B36A A9A2 A651 7878  7645 1202 821C BE2C D9C1

So that's good - I'll set a trust level for the signing key too - but it looks like the command line gpg keys & verification isn't tying up with my GUI-side keys. Probably not a big deal as it shouldn't compromise me, but do you know why its doing this, & how to fix it?

Thanks for all your help anyway, I'll go ahead and upgrade to 0.14
