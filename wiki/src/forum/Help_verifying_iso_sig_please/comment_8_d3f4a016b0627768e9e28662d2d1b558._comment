Me again, 
Forget the part about gnupgshell & command line not tying up, I've now read the page you'd linked and see that when I imported via the command line I got:
gpg: key 1202821CBE2CD9C1: \"Tails developers (signing key) <tails@boum.org>\" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
So key was already there. 

Not sure why I got the BAD message the first time round then.
