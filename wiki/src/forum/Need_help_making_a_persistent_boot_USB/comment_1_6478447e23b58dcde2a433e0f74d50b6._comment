Without fail, when I use the USB Installer from a booted TAILS, I have always been able to create a bootable USB by copying the saved TAILS ISO file to my desktop and selecting the third choice at the bottom of the USB Installer to burn it from the ISO image on the Desktop to the USB.

However, it is necessary to first do the following to make that possible:

1) launch the Disk Utility tool with the blank USB to be installed plugged in

2) Select the USB

3) Format an MBR from the Drive (top half) of the Disk Utility display

4) Format the Volume from the Volume (bottom half) of the Disk Utility display and name it /dev/sdx1 where x is the last letter in the Drive device name and make sure you choose the FAT format, and in the Volume section check the bootable attribute.
