Can someone please suggest methods for playing movies correctly. I have 10TB worth of ripped dvd's but Totem doesn't play them very well. Most of the movies end up playing with spanish or other dubbed sound over the top. In windows I can play any movie in media player but with totem I have to click on each file, and each file in the same movie plays differently ie different language! is there a format which works the best? Its unfortunate to have to shut down tails and run windows every time I wish to play a movie
