Sir, as it is well known that Tails and TOR don't leak the DNS servers of our ISPs and thus provide complete anonymity.

There are also Open/Public DNS servers like google dns (8.8.8.8/8.8.8.4) etc. but they are limited in number. I always configure the DNS server IPs in the network connection settings (in Windows) but since Google collects a lot of data and other open dns providers are very limited and famous and thus there servers can be seized any time.

In order to take extra precaution, I always following two websites to know which DNS servers TOR and TAILS are using:
http://www.dnsleaktest.com
and
https://www.dns-oarc.net/oarc/services/dnsentropy

Then I select and use the IP addresses of different countries and set those DNS IPs into my computer's network configuration so that I use those DNS servers even when I use computer without TOR/TAILS and thus permanently block own ISP's auto dns query.

I have been doing it for the last 9-10 months, but now I wanted to know if this is a good method that I am using.
