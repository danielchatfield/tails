Okay, so I installed Tails onto my USB, and the USB was automatically renamed to "TAILS 0.10.1 - 2". When I open it up, there are to files that show, one is named "isolinux" and the other was named "live". I downloaded refit and tried detecting Tails from there and all it showed was the option to "Boot Mac OS X" and the other option was to "Boot Legacy OS" (Not completely sure if those were the exact words, it said something around that line.) Anyways, so I click on "Boot Legacy OS" and it shows a black screen and a line  that says "Missing Operating System" with an underscore right under that line that keeps appearing and disappearing. What did I do wrong here?
