I use Tails on a DVD

Can I create a file hosted filesystem and store it somewhere (eg luks partition or anywhere)

Can I mount this file in the correct location and have the tails persistent feature use it?

Does anyone know how to use the tails persistence features with your persistence filesystem stored somewhere other than the default?
