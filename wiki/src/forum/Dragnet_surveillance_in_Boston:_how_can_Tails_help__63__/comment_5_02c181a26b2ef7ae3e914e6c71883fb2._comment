Your support is much appreciated!

@ \"Tails\":

I realize that sponsorship from the National Democratic Institute (NDI) may place you under some obligation to obey their injunction to disallow anything \"contrary to current US foreign policy objectives\", but many of the users feel that the answer to the world's troubles is not censorship, but *more* free speech, including discussion of topics such as the surveillance methods employed by US TLAs and increasingly by US (and German and Israeli and French and...) surveillance companies.

You also recently censored links to important stories illustrating why a point some of use have been trying to make for years, that reporters and ordinary web posters (who discuss \"forbidden\" information) are among the prime targets of international spookery, is now beginning to be recognized by major news organizations, including US news organizations which are not generally regarded as being \"anti-American\" [sic], such as Fox News.
