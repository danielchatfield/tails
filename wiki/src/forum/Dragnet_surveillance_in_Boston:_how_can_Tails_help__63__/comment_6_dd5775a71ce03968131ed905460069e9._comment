@ \"Tails\":

> Such a super-wide \"question for discussion\" is no good reason to spam this forum with looooads of off-topic text. 

But you never gave the thread a chance to develop!

Many posts here in effect ask for 

* explanations of methods which Tails users use to combat surveillance techniques mentioned in the news
* advice on possible stop-gap measures general topics

But very often the poster's question suggests ignorance of related techniques which are easier for our adversaries and therefore more likely to be encountered.  Or which overlooks some technical issue.  

All too often, when some of us try to explain these background issues, you declare the information \"off-topic\", and many of us are beginning to suspect that the real reason is that good information about surveillance techniques commonly employed against journalists, their sources, political dissidents, environmental activists, rival political parties, etc., methods employed by US TLAs but also by software sold by international surveillance-as-a-service companies like Gamma International to many of the most repressive regimes on the planet, are \"inconsistent with US foreign policy objectives\", in the phrase employed by National Democratic Institute, a sponsor of the Tails Project, in describing political limits it places on the activities of its grantees.

If so, I feel that such censorship is inconsistent with the stated goals of the Tails Project.

The answer is not more censorship, but more and better-informed free discussion of the fundamental issue which concerns us all here: privacy vs. surveillance.
