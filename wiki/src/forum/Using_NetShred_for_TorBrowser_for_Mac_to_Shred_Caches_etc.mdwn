Using a Mac Computer.

Situation: I use NetShred for MAC to shred/destroy with military/nsa grade all browser cache, history, cookies, password from Safari, Chrome, Firefox WITHOUT Tor.

Question: Â  I use Tor and I want to be able to do the same and shred/destroy with all (military/nsa etc) grades available to shred/destroy all browser cache, history, cookies, passwords of TorBrowser (Firefox based) while using Tor.

NetShred for Mac app gives me the option to add files in a list to be deleted/shreded. What are the files that should be shredded ? Where are they located ? Is it needed ?
