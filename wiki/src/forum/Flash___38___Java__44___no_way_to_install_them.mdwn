I cant use tails, it was a waste of burning of DVD. theres no way to install java or flash to do what i want to do with it. When i go to adobe site it thinks i have windows and offers the exe. 

When i try to run a .deb installer for java or flash, .debs dont run on tails

when i search of java or flash in the Add-Ons section, it does not find java or flash themselves, it only finds accesories for them

there is no way to install java or flash on tails and it says nothing about installing java or flash on tails in the documentation pages.

This is bizarre and renders the system useless to me, theres a page i want to go to using Tails that uses flash but its not high bandwidth videos. 

TRheres simply no way to install java or flash on tails, and thats VERY BIZARRE.
