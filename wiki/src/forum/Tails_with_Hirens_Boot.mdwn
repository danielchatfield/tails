Hello

I'm using HBCD Restored edition that includes an option to work with Backtrack, SystemRescue CD and Tails. Backtrack and SystemRescue works fine but I have a problem with Tails.

These are the instructions to join Tail with HBCD:

1. Download the iso image from https://tails.boum.org
2. Using IsoMaster extract and then remove from the image
the directory /live.
2. Save the truncated iso image with the name tails.iso.
3. Open the HBCD iso image and add the directory /live to the root of the iso image. Also the file tails.iso to the  /iso directory of the HBCD iso image and then save.

So, when I boot with HBCD and I choose Tails, I can see the welcome screen of Tails, asking me to choose between "normal" and "safe" boot. (I don't remember the exact names). Using any of these options, Tails doesn't start and the same screen is always shown.

Regards
Mike
