Any comments on connecting to Tor with the following methods ?


Connect to Tor via SSH, VPN or Double VPN (VPN product/service that don't keep logs & created account VPN accounts are paid in Bitcoin (anonymous) 

OR 

Connect via SSH, VPN or Double VPN all paid accounts paid in Bitcoin (anonymous) and then TOR ?

** Don't forget some websites block Tor ip's or IRC channels so that why **

** How do we keep Tor going and in the same time keep ISP blind from their clients using Tor & IRC/websites blocking Tor ? ***


Finally, this is a suggestion from a user for total anonymity:

“The correct path of your config is: PC (OpenVPN with proxy) -> TOR entry -> TOR exit -> VPN server -> SSH server

There should be no need to torify anything. Every application should transparently use VPN over TOR (thanks to OpenVPN proxy features). Furthermore, UDP traffic now can go through TOR (it’s TCP over UDP, done by OpenVPN)!

In this way:
- SSH server sees VPN server IP address
- VPN server sees TOR exit node IP address
- VPN server sees SSH encrypted traffic
- TOR servers see OpenVPN+SSH encrypted traffic

The packets which finally go out have the SSH server IP address on their header. ”
