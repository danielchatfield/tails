Apart from the use of Tor and Tails, what is the accuracy for investigators to pinpoint a 3G USB-modem connected to a laptop in a populated area? The laptop has no GPS/Bluetooth/IR or other any other communication device. Some say it's possible to be pyshically pinpointed with an accuracy of 150 meters, some say 50 meters but what is the current accuracy? I know they pinpoint by calculating the distances between the modem and the celltowers, but is it possible for them to pinpoint you with an accuracy of 10 meters or less? I know that pinpointing a GPS device is with an accuracy of 1 meter, but how is that in the case of a laptop with a 3G USB-modem? 

I know this is not related to Tails or Tor specifically but people on this forum are very privacy aware so maybe someone can share his educated view on this. I want to know this because I want to use an anonymous and prepaid 3G connection for using Tor and not want to use my home connection. They are recording and registering everything these days so if they can pinpoint the location of a 3G-modem with an accuracy of 10 meter then they record the coordinates of my appartment and they know there lives a Tor-user. In that case I have to use 3G --> VPN --> Tor. But imagine that if the accuracy would be around 100 meters, in that case it's more difficult for them to locate he Tor-user exactly (in an area of 100 meters live around 300 people).

Any knowledge/suggestions/brainstorms on this issue would be very appreciated.
