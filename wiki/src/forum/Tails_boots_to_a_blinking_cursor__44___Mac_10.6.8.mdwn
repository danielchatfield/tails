I have tried everything imaginable, the manual install copies the files correctly but won't boot at all. I tried using several USB installer apps and they too look like they work but one wouldn't boot and the other says it will only boot on Windows. I ended up loading Tails in Virtualbox and used the built in USB installer "Clone and Install", that seemed like it was working and it finished. I rebooted and got the refit menu, chose linux and then I get stuck with a flashing cursor that doesn't work with the keyboard so I have to do a hard reboot. I have searched for answers but have found nothing that works so far. Is there anyway that I can get this working? Thanks in advance.
