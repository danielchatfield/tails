I was using TAILS, like I frequently do. I was downloading a video to an external HDD.  It was downloading alot faster than usual for tor (about 250kb/s).  I played a video that was large (over 1 gig), the video froze in full screen for a while.  I tried to move the mouse but the icon was gone.  I hit esc button, hit ctr-alt-del, though I don't think that works with Linux. About 2 or 3 min later, the video left full screen, and a message box popped up that said "You are currently logged in as Debian Live User. The system will now shut down in 60 sec".  I hit cancel, closed the video player. I lost my internet connection, when I tried to reconnect, I could not pick up any networks when I usually have 10+ around.  I tried to open the log viewer and i got the message "Error, could not allocate memory".  My computer has 3 gb ram.  Did I over do my memory, did I get hacked, did I encounter a bug?
