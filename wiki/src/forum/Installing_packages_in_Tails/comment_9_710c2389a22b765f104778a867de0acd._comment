You can opt to download the packages only without installing them with apt-get, as it has this option:

    -d, --download-only
    
    Download only; package files are only retrieved,
    not unpacked or installed.

Now you can compare md5 hashes with the originals, manually one by one prior to manual installation and archive the packages and hashes so you don't have to download them again and rehash and reinstall on your next Tails session.
