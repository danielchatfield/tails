Good on ya for the \"Good on ya\" :o)

>After a few thoughts I got wondering if installing packages or even updating the existing ones (from Debian) might be counter productive to Tails security. Is that true?

yep

>I mean its better not to touch anything, is that right?

spot on

although... if it's a small installation - a package you trust, which doesn't pull in too much cruft, then you *should* be fine (usual caveat applies: bugger about with Tails at your own risk... blah... blah... blah...)

If there are missing dependencies, the apt-get command will tell you how many and what additional packages it'll need to pull in and ask for confirmation.

**Updating** from Debian is severely ungood. DO NOT **UPDATE** YOUR TAILS FROM DEBIAN!

That's about to change though - soon Tails will maintain its own repo... then updating will be good again! ;o)
