Verifying doesn't unlock anything.

Tails USB Installer is only accessible from within Tails, when you have started you computer runnings Tails instead of Windows/Ubuntu/whatever-your-os-is. Simply mounting the ISO image doesn't help.

If you have a DVD burner, follow the instructions in the documentation for how to burn to and boot from a DVD. Once booted from that DVD, you will find Tails USB Installer.

If you need to install Tails to an USB right away, try following these instructions:
