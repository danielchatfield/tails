Pardon me. Maybe if you have a sticky thread here with forum rules it would be handy. Something like \"Please read this before posting\".

Anyway, if you or others who have experience can kindly tell me if this software bypasses tails configration/firewall in any way, please go ahead.

I need to ask about this because there is no youtube solution in Tails as far as I know.

Thanks.
