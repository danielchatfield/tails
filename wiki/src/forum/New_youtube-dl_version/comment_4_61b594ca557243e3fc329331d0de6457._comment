I think I can help a little...

Youtube has an experimental feature for html 5 that will allow you to watch most videos. Just append \"&html5=1\" to the end of the url. This will work for all videos that do not have advertisements. Eventually, I'm sure it will work for all videos.

You may also need to add an \"allow\" exception to noscript to access the video.

I'm not sure of the impact html5 will have on the tor network.
