There, fixed that for you! ;o)

I think it's now common knowledge that \"Yahoo\" no longer does much more than present results from \"Bing\", which in turn has been proven to be nothing more than a Microsoft front-end for Google.

Of course Google doesn't much like other corporations taking its painstakingly processed data, scraping off its ads and replacing them with their own, so tries to make the process difficult. That's why the results of all the unofficial Google front-ends (Bing, Yahoo, Startpage, Scroogle (RIP), etc.) are so variable.
