good info.  i was wondering about Startpage/Ixquick results not being all that great (and DuckDuckGo too, for that matter) but its worth it if it means i can avoid google snooping on me everywhere and adding to the huge store of profile data they already have on me.

also, i find that once i get used to SP i dont miss google that much as the results i'm looking for are usually in the first page anyway.
