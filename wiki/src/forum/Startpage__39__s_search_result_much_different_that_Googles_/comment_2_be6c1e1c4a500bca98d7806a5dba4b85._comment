@ Bill:

You might start with the Wikipedia articles on Startpage, IxQuick, DuckDuck, and other alternatives to the monster search engines: Google, Bing, Yahoo.

The alternatives mostly act as proxies which pass on search requests to Google, which is relucant to provide information to anyone it cannot easily identify and track all over heck and gone.  Just one reason why you can't expect alternative search engines to provide pages and pages of hits the way Google does.
