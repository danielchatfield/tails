Hi,
I restarted USB in persistent way and when I made update (apt-get update) all files and folders are NOT located in  persistent folder than in amnesia folder. it means when i restart, update will not be remembered for next time, if it is so, I must update every time I start tails in USB? 

is it possible to relocate all this folders into Persistent folder or is there any other way that tails remember update? 
here is screenshot: http://i50.tinypic.com/ipmtmd.png

I understood that persistance means that we don't need to update, install and change settings every time we use tails.
I will now restart and see what will happen. 

by the way, when I made persistance, I checked all options about personal files, etc.
