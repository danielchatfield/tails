Vidalia still doesn't start sometimes like before and it is necessary to reboot, reboot, reboot. Manually opening Vidalia has the same message as before in the message log (giving up).

Trying to dig deeper with the Icewasel Tor Button and then clicking Test Settings reports that the connection could not start and asks if Polipo is running.

The clock sync stuff still seems confused and not functioning properly.
