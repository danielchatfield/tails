I visitted the Bastille Linux project page a moment ago and I got this weird "site could not be found" message in what Google Translate tells me to be Japanese. 

Would would Bastille Linux's wordpress website display an error message in Japanese? Is this a failed geolocation attempt of sorts? I find it really weird because I'm using Tails 0.15 with the default US keyboard.
