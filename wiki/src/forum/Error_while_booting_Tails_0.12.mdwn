(i try to retype in english my own previous french message, if it can help)

Several Tails 0.12 users have noticed a bug while booting. It seems to appear be quite randomly, depending on the computer kind or whatever.

Everything seems to start normally until the connection screen : the system then stops on an error message, without launching the graphical server. 

HERE'S A WORKAROUND THAT SEEMS TO WORK :

* TYPE SIMULTANEOUSLY ON CTRL+ALT+F1

* THE SYSTEM SWITCHES TO CONSOLE MODE

* TYPE AGAIN ON CTRL+ALT BUT WITH THIS TIME THE F7 TOUCH

* THE SYSTEM SWITCHES AGAIN TOWARDS GRAPHIC MODE

THEN THE CONNECTION SCREEN GOES ON...

Thanks for telling if someone has the same bug, and if this thread helps.
