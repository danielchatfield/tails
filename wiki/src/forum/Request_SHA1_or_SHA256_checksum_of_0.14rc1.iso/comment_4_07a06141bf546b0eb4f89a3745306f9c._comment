A state actor could break into the tails dev house and steal their private key, sneak and peak, are you telling me the tails developers have better PHYSEC than a chinese intelligence agency covert entry team?


This could be used to sign anything as tails authentic code


Revoking \"trusted\" private keys is a well-known problem.
