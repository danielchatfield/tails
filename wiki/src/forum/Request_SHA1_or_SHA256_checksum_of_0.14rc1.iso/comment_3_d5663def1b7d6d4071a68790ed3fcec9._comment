>Why would you consider a SHA256 sum weaker

it could, in its self, convey no authenticity whatsoever

>The private key could be compromised by blackhats and used to sign trojaned code.

By what means? There are no known attacks which can even come close to providing this.

>If the SHA256 sum is verified as the same sum the tails developers specify, then it is the same code

and how exactly do you intend to authenticate \"the sum the tails developers specify\"? Over http(s) from an anonymous forum? This would obviously be much \"weaker\" than PKI!
