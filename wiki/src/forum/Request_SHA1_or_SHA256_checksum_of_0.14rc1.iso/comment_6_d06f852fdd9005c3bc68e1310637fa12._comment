Smiley faces :))

This reminds me of comunism :( Not even 25 years ago. But it's suppose 2B capitalism now. Funny. I let U know: in comunism, we were sharing \"anti-regime\" things like books, ideas, etc, hand-by-hand. And I mean from-person-to-person. This way everyone creates his own chain of trust from People, not \"baiti\" :). Of course there were some \"sneaking\" person somewhere, but that person was human and with his own head choosed to let pass the material to the authorities or not (in our case, change the materials or not).

These days, the person chain could be the e-mail chain. What U say? seems the same. Or even easier: quit the damn baytes and chose human lifes. After all, a lots of strange things hapens using tails... browser closed unexpected, bokkmark star yellow after changing the tab and returning to the bookmerked one... And avery rocket will have its anti-rocket and that his anti-anti-rocket and so on.. Good job. Wandering if it helps. Only if Tails it is developed live. And with an update of Tails in 1 month (lately faster) I dont see it keep it live. 

Anyway, 4 users who haesn't know the \"Procter and Gamble Protection\" :) white teeth and that only :)) U coud post on site the sha 256 hash. Or if it takes 2much time, only the crc32 hash. PS: Its faster: Joy!

Not eberyone is techiee. So if we are not we are refused any oder form of checking. Even fake as u say. Smailei feisis. Thancks a lot. Keep it up, bro! But do not wonder if tails users become less and less and less... and by-by. After all, the anonimous group is about 5-10 techies and hundreds of stupid copysts who only lets theis pc-s on... Someday u'll notice that tails users are only techies. So. Waht. U . got ? Techie. Keep it 4 iourself.
