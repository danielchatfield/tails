PS: I'm not a smoker. U? But I smell smokers smoke. I cant prevent it from happening. Cause smokers cant notice there are unsmokers around. Why? theri're too busy with the smoke or the cigar or their embraced by smoke. Make a brake, man. Stop the cigar and when the sky is blu, not white by smoke, we can see each other and understand .
