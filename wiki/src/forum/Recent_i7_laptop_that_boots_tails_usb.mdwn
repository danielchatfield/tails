Hi,

Anyone who has a recent core i7 laptop that you know definitely boots Tails ok *from usb* please post.  

Looking for an easy-to-order-online core i7 laptop, preferably Ivy Bridge quad core, with 6-8GB ram, 750GB-1TB HD, usb3, HD screen and graphics, and multi or pref. blueray burner.  Not a gamer so high end graphics and fast hard drive not needed, but good looking design and a great screen would be pluses.   I'm in Europe.

I'd be very grateful for any suggestions.

TIA
