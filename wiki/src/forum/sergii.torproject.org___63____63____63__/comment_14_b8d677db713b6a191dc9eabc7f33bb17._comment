@ Comment 13:

I am not sure I understand what I am saying, but I had no trouble in Tails 0.15 in changing the home page to a local file.

    Edit -> Preferences -> General

Using some Debian tools which I live installed, I checked and I am pretty sure that after the initial contact (before I have a chance to change the home page) the behavior which worries you stops.  I am booting from a DVD but if you are booting from a live USB stick and taking advantage of persistent configuration, you should be able to arrange that you only visit torcheck when you want to do that.
