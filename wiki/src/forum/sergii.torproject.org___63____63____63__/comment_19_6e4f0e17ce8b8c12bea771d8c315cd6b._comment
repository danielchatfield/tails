As an afterthought: please confirm that you do understand that the torcheck servers are operated by the Tor Project.  I am pretty sure they are in the US so subject to secret police surveillance/intimidation/seizure, but to some extent we need to trust the Tor Project if we are going to use Tor at all.  And on balance, well-informed observers think we can trust most Tor developers.

Here is a really good link which should explain just one good reason why:
