> Have you guys noticed that whenever we launch Tails, either from DVD or USB, we have to establish connection with a server? One of my friends who is an expert Tor user told me the reason for doing so is to run the \"do_not_ever_run_me\" file. This is to help whoever is monitoring the connection to check your physical location.

Please back such accusations with actual facts, such as network traces or anything remotely rational.
