>Can users deactivate that unnecessary behaviour? Havent find something in configuration,GUI/aboutconfig

I have heard from the grapevine that one of the sponsors of Electronic Frontier Foundation is NSA of the US.

Have you guys noticed that whenever we launch Tails, either from DVD or USB, we have to establish connection with a server? One of my friends who is an expert Tor user told me the reason for doing so is to run the \"do_not_ever_run_me\" file. This is to help whoever is monitoring the connection to check your physical location. NSA or CIA could be behind it as well.

How's that for anonymity?
