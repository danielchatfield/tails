I agree with the writer of comment 20. S/he wrote:

We know Tails costs nothing to download and we are not obliged to make donations to the Tails project. Hence, as a kind gesture, would Tails explain why Iceweasel has to connect to sergii.torproject.org at every startup and why the connection to sergii can be stopped?

My recommendation is that starting from the next version 0.16 or 0.17, Tails could make it an option to connect to sergii or better still, remove the connection altogether.

>I am pretty sure they are in the US so subject to secret police surveillance/intimidation/seizure,

Is sergii.torproject.org located in the US of A?

If yes, this is bad, very bad, extremely bad news.

There is a news article written by New York Times, Bloomberg or Forbes quoting an official of Department of Homeland Security as saying something like \".....they (VPNs and anonymity providers) can promise anything to their customers, but at the end of the day, when we want the records of so-and-so activities, they just have to produce them.\"

Many critics of Electronic Frontier Foundation, a sponsor of the Tor Project, have warned in the past that Tor is nothing but a tool used to help US authorities to conduct covert surveillance.
