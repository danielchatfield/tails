AFAICT, all of these are either documented in
[[contribute/design]], has a Git branch pending for review, or
has an open ticket in our bug / task tracker. From this starting
point, the only efficient ways I see to make things better or
different are:

* fix the bugs, or find someone who will
* discuss on the tails-dev mailing list the design choices you dislike

None of this is likely to happen on this forum, so I consider this case as closed here.
