For something to be considered a fact it has to first be proven with actual evidence, none of the comments in this thread have posted anything to backup their claims at all, and as long as that is the case all of those comments will be considered unfounded FUD.

PS: I'm not the author of the comment you quoted, just in case that was not clear.
