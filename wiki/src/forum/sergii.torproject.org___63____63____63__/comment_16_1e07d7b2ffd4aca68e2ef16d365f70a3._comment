@ comment 12

I am the writer of comments 2, 4 and 6.

>(such as attempts, which the Tails community would be wise to expect, to discourage people in China from using Tails to circumvent censorship and surveillance).

I apologize if some of the readers of my posts have the wrong impression that I was discouraging the using of Tails by potential users from China. Far be it, I have been actively assisting users in China with using it.

Tails' developers should feel proud that their software has achieved brand recognition nationwide in China where the freedom of speech has been severely curtailed with the recent passing into Chinese law on internet controls.

China employs about 50,000 staff to patrol the internet. Many more are involved in tearing apart software, including Tails, that circumvent internet controls. I view it as a good thing for Tails as it would spur its developers to improve and build a more robust software.
