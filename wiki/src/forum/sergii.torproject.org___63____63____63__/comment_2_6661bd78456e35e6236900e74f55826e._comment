I bet that the OP is from China.

I travel to China frequently, about two to three times a month, to do business and network with all kinds of people. I even help \"educate\" my contacts on the use of Tor and Tails clandestinely.

It has come to my attention that the PLA (People's Liberation Army) has redoubled its internet brigade to conduct more surveillance on China's web users and foreign threats.

Two months ago, the biggest foreign threat identified by China's Ministry of Defense is the increasing use of Tails and Tor by Chinese internet users.

IMHO both Tails and Tor developers should be proud that their efforts are being taken very seriously by China.

**To: OP**

Welcome, Comrade from PRC. Please do continue to point out issues such as the one that you posted. Only then will Tails and Tor be able to make improvements. Thank you.
