You shouldn't need to use about:config.  Go into Edit -> Preferences -> General.

Changing your home page there should prevent visits to torcheck each time you open a new Tails browser page, I think.

You may be correct that a visit to torcheck is unavoidable when you first boot the Tails browser.

Are you running Tails from a DVD or a USB stick?  Are you using a persistent configuration?  If so, you probably have greater control over what happens when you boot Tails.
