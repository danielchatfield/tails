@ OP and Comment 5:

When you start a browser based on Firefox/Iceweasel (FF/IW) such as the one which comes with Tails, it loads a page called your \"home page\", which might be a \"local file\" on your own computer, or a page somewhere on the Internet.

In Tails 0.15 (and presumably also in Tails 0.16c), in the default configuration of the modified Iceweasel (IW) browser which comes with Tails, your home page is set to

* <https://check.torproject.org/>

And sergii.torproject.org is the name of one of the (two?) servers operated by the Tor Project which serve this page.

If loading this page every time you start the browser bothers you, you can change your home page using the menu of the modified IW browser which comes with Tails

  Edit -> Preferences -> General

These days most laptop/PC users of Tor probably use either Tails or Tor Browser Bundle (TBB).  TBB users should know that there is an additional reason why TBB also uses check.torproject.org as the home page of the IW browser which comes with TBB: this site will alert TBB users who are using an outdated version of TBB.  Because TBB and Tails are not regular Debian or Ubuntu packages, many users may use this extra reminder because their package manager will not know when their Tails or TBB require security patches.   For this reason, Tails users should regularly check to see whether a new version of Tails is available.

Comments 2-4 and 6 are irrelevant (in fact, trolling).  Regrettable that this happens, but especially in a pro-privacy forum we all need to expect that.  The answer is to simply continue doing what we do here: asking questions, and answering them if we know the answer.

My first reply did not appear; I hope this post fares better.
