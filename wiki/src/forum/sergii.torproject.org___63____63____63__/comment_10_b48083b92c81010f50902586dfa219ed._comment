I agree that pranksters (or the penny brigade) are active here, but one should not rush to judgement.

There is a kernel of truth in stories about connections between 

* Tor, Mixmaster, and the EFF
* US military agencies and corporations with a pro-surveillance business model and which work closely with US intelligence agencies

But you need to get your facts straight before trying to assess whether or not you want to use Tor (or trust the EFF), or you may needlessly deprive yourself of using valuable tools, or valuable information and advice from the EFF.

A related point which has been made in many threads in this forum is that a substantial fraction of the technocrats who operate the modern surveillance state are deeply unhappy with what they do on behalf of increasingly frightened and repressive governments worldwide.  (An example recently mentioned in another thread in this forum can be found in Roger Dingledine's recent report in Tor-talk, in which Dingledine quoted an employee of a telecom who obviously dislikes his role in operating country-scale surveillance.)

And don't forget that no government or corporation is monolithic; inside the worst organizations one often finds people whose ideology makes them potential whistleblowers.  (People fall into such work by many strange routes, and the sheer number of techocrats needed to operate modern systems ensures that a large fraction of them will not be naturally inclined to further advance the forces of oppression.)  We should all encourage such people to risk their careers (or worse) to come forward.

As an example of an internal struggle inside the largest and most lethal government of them all, the US Federal government, news stories from major media outlets recently discussed a struggle inside the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) between those who wanted to keep some important privacy protections and those who wanted to eliminate them.  I don't have to tell you which side won, but the point here is that these accounts validated claims back in March that this struggle was in progress.  The same story also tends to validate claims that fractures have been appearing in the public-private partnership between the US Federal government and the corporations on which it has relied to do much of its dirty work.

While sceptism is warranted regarding any claims in an area where any sensible person should expect to encounter much misinformation and even disinformation (sometimes surprisingly crude, sometimes quite sophisticated), there are also many verified whistleblowers and considerable evidence that large numbers of potential whistleblowers still exist inside \"Western\" surveillance systems (despite all the forces seeking to crush internal dissent inside \"Western\" governments and corporations).
