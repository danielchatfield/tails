The part about \"every keystoke\" is totally wrong, to the best of my knowledge. If someone pretends that is the case, they'd better be prepared to show evidence thereof.

However, it's true that much data about the activities conducted during a given Tails session are stored in RAM. This is how GNU/Linux systems work, and probably not something we at Tails will try to change.
