Yes, Tails can be tricky to make it persistent, I noticed. For security
reasons Tails relies heavy on *strict* security procedures. I saw if I
do not follow the procedure, it might not work. That is the price
I have to pay for Tails security... <br>
<br>
I noticed I can only create a persistent partition on the *same*
pendrive as the pendrive I used to boot my PC into Tails. I can not
create a persistent partition if I boot from a Tails DVD. I can not
create a persistent partition on *another* pendrive (if 2 pendrives are
plugged into the PC). It worked well on my brand new cheap 4 gig
pendrive. It must be a \"real\" pendrive, not an external usb harddisk.
Also it seems to work on the \"normal\" size pendrives, not the ones with
- say - 256 gig. Needless to say the pendrive must be *empty*, nothing
on it.<br>
<br>
What I did:<br>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded and verified the Tails ISO file</li>
<li>I burned the ISO onto a blanc DVD</li>
<li>Changed my BIOS settings to boot from DVD, booted PC into Tails OS</li>
<li>In the Tails menu I created the Tails pendrive</li>
<li>I shutdown Tails, removed the DVD, labeled the DVD and stored it
for future need</li>
<li>Changed BIOS again, to boot PC from a pendrive</li>
<li>Booted PC from pendrive into Tails</li>
<li>In the Tails menu I configured the persistent partition on the
same pendrive, I checked all persistent options.</li>
</ol>
