This problem was introduced with Tails 0.14~RC1 and continues in 0.14.

To the previous poster, no, I wasn't using what you described. I was simply browsing the web, clearweb, not hidden services or anything other than the regular www.

What is the root of this message, which is highlighted in yellow in my vidalia logs and how may I put an end to it?
