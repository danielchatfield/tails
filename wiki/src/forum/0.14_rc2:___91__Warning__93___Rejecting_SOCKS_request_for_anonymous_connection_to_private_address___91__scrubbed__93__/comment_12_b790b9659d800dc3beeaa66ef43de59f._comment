>Isn't that like \"pregnantish\"?

Is pregnantish a word?.. if so I think it might apply to me.

Anyway, I read it more as \"Scottish\" or \"feverish\" - real words in which the suffix conveys \"having the property of\". So in the context above \".onionish\" would be a light-hearted way of expressing \".onion related traffic or content or something\"

>It's either .onion or it's not.

Yes

>Or is there something in between clear web and \"onion web\"?

No
