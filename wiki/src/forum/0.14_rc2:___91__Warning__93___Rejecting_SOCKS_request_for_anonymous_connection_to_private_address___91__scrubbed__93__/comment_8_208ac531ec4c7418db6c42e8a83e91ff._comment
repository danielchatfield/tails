@ OP:

Did this happen when you visited the jondos anonymity test site?  If so, as part of the test, your browser is instructed to do many things which would be a huge warning sign if it happens when you browse to another site, including attempting to use a known longstanding hole in FF/IW and other major browsers by which browsers are easily tricked into sending \"authentication data\".  If you saw a popup window, that is not good, but seeing the message you report is a good sign because it means that the tester was not able to access information via your browser which you certainly do not what a webserver to be able to access, at least not while using Tails.

When you use the anonymity test at jondos, you should also see connections to third party sites, a \"new identity\" being forced, and some other things.  The IP address returned should correspond to the Tor exit node you were using to contact jondos, of course.  When you use the tester, you should stare at your \"network map\" display from Vidalia controller to see all this monkey business.  Now you know some things to look for when you are surfing which you don't want to see.
