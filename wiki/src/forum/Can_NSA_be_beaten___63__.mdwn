Hello Tails people

Is it possible in the near future that community be able to provide protection methods even against an adversary like NSA?

and two: How can we ever know if NSA has -for example- broken AES in secret? What about all the classified tools? How can people ever know what these guys have achieved in the first place to be able to protect against it?

How can open source ever beat NSA closed source? They can see you and your code but you cant do the same to them.
