18:23 <Branes> Apple changed the UEFI structure with the newest MacBook Pro's and the latest 
               iMac refresh.
18:23 <Branes> As such, neither rEFIt nor grub (nor grub+) will work.
18:25 <Branes> The change is a little over five weeks old.
18:26 <Branes> Until the rEFIt people wake up and fix the limitation, it won't work at all 
               with the newest EFI firmware that's been shipping in all machines for just over 
       a month.
18:26 <Branes> rf you just bought it, then it has the new UEFI structure.
18:28 <Branes> Apple use 'Protected GPT' which is a dogs' breakfast.
18:30 <Branes> The main problem with pGPT is twofold: 1) no linux loader knows how to deal 
               with it, and 2) it is no better than MBR in that you are limited to four 
       partitions ... and Apple already use three, one for EFI, one for the main OSX volume, 
       and a third for the Recovery partition.
18:34 <Branes> Best be thankful, then, that you bought a new machine now, and not in four 
               months :)
18:35 <klausa> What will they change in 4 months ;)?
18:35 <Branes> klausa: They adopt the changes to UEFI proposed by Microsoft.
18:35 <Branes> Machines then will *only* be able to boot Mac OS X, iOS Desktop, or 
               Windows 7 -- the hardware will not aloow any other OS.
