So yes is the short answer to your question.
As for the Liberte suggestion. I suggested it. That's why I didn't specify Tails. No Live USB will boot on a late 2011 MBP for a reason yet to be determined.

rEFIt, rEFInd, auto, manual installs to no avail.

I do however know that Apple's Boot Camp Assistant restricts access to USB on all models that have DVD drives. Seems the only models that do not have this restriction are the Macbook Mini and Macbook Air models.

However for bootcamp at least these restrictions can be overcome with a little tinkering of Bootcamp's info.plist file. Instructions found here:
https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3410900?start=15&tstart=0

However still this gives me no access to booting from USB. There must be something else... I thing the new Macbooks are restricting Boot devices somewhere. Alas my knowledge is lacking and I haven't found where these restrictions can be altered.

And yes, I know all too well that Mac owners don't like to get their hands dirty. :)
