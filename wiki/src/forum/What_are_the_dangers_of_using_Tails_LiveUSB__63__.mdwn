All this while I have been using Tails on a LiveDVD but I am planning on switching to using a USB instead.

What are the dangers of using Tails on a USB stick?

Is the following scenario possible when using Tails LiveUSB?

Suppose I use Tails LiveUSB on a public computer in an internet cafe. One can safely assume that there are tons of malware, trojan horses and viruses on it.

Is it possible for them to cross over (jump) from the infected computer on to my USB thumb/flash drive when I am using Tails?

Are there any malware that operate/exist at the BIOS level such that when I am booting Tails from the USB drive, they infect my USB stick?

I do not have such concerns when I use Tails LiveDVD because the DVD is only write-once.
