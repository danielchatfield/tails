A major issues of software like rkhunter is that, in general, they only look at the *upstream* version number, and don't know about security patches backported into older versions of software included in long-term supported (stable) distributions.

You'll be better served to learn about the current status, security-wise, of these pieces of software in Debian, by looking at the Debian security tracker:

* <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/openssl>
* <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/gnupg>
