Great news! Welcome aboard! :) For details about translation work on Tails, please have a look on the [[translator documentation|contribute/how/translate]]. Tell us if anything is unclear. Do not hesitate to drop by the `#tails` or `#tails-dev` IRC channels if you have questions that need quick answers.

We strongly dislike the idea of having only one translator for a given language. Provided than you find other people, then we would very much like to add Italian to the website languages.
