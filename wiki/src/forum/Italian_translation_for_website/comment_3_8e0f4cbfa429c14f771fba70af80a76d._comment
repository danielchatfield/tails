I'm not sure what to reply to this. A lone person cannot:

1. peer-review their own work
2. be always here and available when needed

I'm sorry, I know bootstrapping a team can be hard, but I don't think we can seriously rely on individuals in this area :(

If you want to discuss it with more of us, I suggest moving to a better suited place, that is to the tails-l10n mailing-list.
