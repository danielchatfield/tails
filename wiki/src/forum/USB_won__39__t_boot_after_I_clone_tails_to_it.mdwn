Hello all,
n00b to tails. I got it running from dvd fine, and i used the tails installer to clone it to my usb (8gb) but when I restart my computer, and change the boot order to usb, it doesnt read it. what do i have to do to get it booting from just my usb? and what is the best way to dismount/shutdown tails when i'm done? thanks for the help
