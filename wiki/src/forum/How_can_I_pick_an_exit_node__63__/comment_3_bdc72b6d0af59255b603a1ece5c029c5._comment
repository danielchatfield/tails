I'm not completely new to TAILS/TOR... but I am new to selecting your exit node. I have read that there are malicious exit nodes that exist to try and get personal information from you, or maybe even try to track down your true IP. Anyway, there used to be a site with a list of exit nodes that exhibited malicious behavior. There was a list you could edit to include these so you would not connect to them. I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to post a short tutorial on how to do this, as I never got that particular file to save properly. I'm not even sure as to where that site with that list is anymore. Any other useful information on malicious or safe exit nodes would be appreciated.

Thanks for any replies
