Recently I posted how to symlink your .mozilla directory to an encrypted usbstick for eg to keep bookmarks and so on, setting up that symlink manually every time you boot tails.

A more complete solution which I'm now testing is to use mount --bind to replace the /home/amnesia directory with a peristent one on your encrypted drive.

Copy /home/amnesia to your encrypted usbstick:

$ cp -a ~/  /media/xxxxxxx-xxx-xxx/

Now first thing after booting tails, close Iceweasel, Nautilus and any applications using the home dir, mount your encrypted drive and do (as root):

# mount --bind /media/xxxxxxx-xxx-xxx/amnesia /home/amnesia

Now all changes to your home dir, bookmarks, nautilus settings and so on will be written to /media/xxxxxxx-xxx-xxx/amnesia transparently and saved for next time.

CAVEAT: tails is going to say that this might run into problems if you boot into a new tails release and changes have been made to the default settings in /home/amnesia.

The safest solution would be to save what you want to save elsewhere before booting into a new tails release, delete /media/xxxxxxx-xxx-xxx/amnesia and do the /media/xxxxxxx-xxx-xxx/amnesia setup process again.
