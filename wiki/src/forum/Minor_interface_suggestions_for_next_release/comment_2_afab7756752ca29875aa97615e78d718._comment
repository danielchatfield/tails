Personally I always move the lower bar to the Left, and I enable the Hide Buttons for the upper Toolbar. This works better for me since I need the lower bar (now Left side bar) for minimizing and switching different windows, and I do not need the upper toolbar except to run some other application when needed (so it stays hidden most of the time). This option is easier to customize than the browser interface (and takes less time too).
