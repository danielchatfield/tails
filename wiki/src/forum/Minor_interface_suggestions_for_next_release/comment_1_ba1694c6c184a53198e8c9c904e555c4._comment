many people have different need about esthetic, I would have many changes and first and most I hate when any Linux has task-bar at the top instead at the bottom of the screen. and newest Ubuntu 11 has task-bar which disappear and in Firefox also menu disappear. catastrophic, but I don't think they will change it just because I don't like it. I like the same as you when I have list of files instead of big icon view. I gave proposal for add-ons for Iceweasel and they didn't installed any of it.
