>Join with the Tor Project to make a forum that would cover both Tor as well as Tails. There could be a sub-forum specific to Tails.

I second that. Currently The Tor Project doesn't have a forum where users can discuss questions or learn from one another. But users can use Pidgin to get some technical advice.

As the saying goes, \"Two heads are better than one\". It will be good to have Tor users on a unified forum.
