I would add the following to the above (comment 12):

-Compile a detailed FAQ that people would be directed-to when posting (Trying to make a new thread should automatically prompt a message urging to first be sure the question is not answered in the FAQ or documentation...)

- Join with the Tor Project to make a forum that would cover both Tor as well as Tails. There could be a sub-forum specific to Tails.
