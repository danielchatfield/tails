> What type of help is the Tails Team looking for?

A lot of different kind of helps! Look at the [[contribute]] section and the [[list of things to do|todo]] for inspiration. Also have a look at the discussions on the [tails-dev mailing-list](https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-dev).

> What area of user help/support would move the process of new stable releases upon a quicker path?

For 0.14 unfortunately, none. For next releases, it's hard to say if we stay purely about support. Having a less stressful forum would be definitely help. We sincerily hope to be put up better tools soon... Improving the documentation or creating screencasts might also help to get less questions that have already been answered elsewhere.
