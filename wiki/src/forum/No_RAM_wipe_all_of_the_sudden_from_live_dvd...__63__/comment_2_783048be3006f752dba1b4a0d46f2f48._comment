IMHO it is not necessary to have RAM wiped so long as you do a proper shutdown.

If you had been working on some sensitive or highly classified work prior to shutting your PC down, you should wait at least 5 minutes after a proper shutdown before you leave your computer unattended.

The contents in the RAM take about at least 5 minutes to clear.
