I didn't say that very well at all.  I mean time spent chasing down unexpected connections or other things I don't understand and therefore feel I should spend time trying to figure out.  Sometimes they turn out to be innocuous.  On a few occasions they are clearly not.  Most often results are inconclusive, which just leaves me with a general sense that these nodes are associated with things I don't understand, and I prefer for safety's sake to avoid such things.
