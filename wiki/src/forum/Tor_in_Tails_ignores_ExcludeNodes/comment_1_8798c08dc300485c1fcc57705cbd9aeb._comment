Are you using `StrictNodes 1` too? Without that option Tor treats the `Exclude*` options more like \"avoid these nodes\" rather than \"never use these nodes\". Also not that [using the `Exclude*` options are not recommended](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#ChooseEntryExit).

I do not understand this question. Care to elaborate?

Tor clients update their consensuses approximately every hour, and that is done using a 1-hop connection to a directory server.
