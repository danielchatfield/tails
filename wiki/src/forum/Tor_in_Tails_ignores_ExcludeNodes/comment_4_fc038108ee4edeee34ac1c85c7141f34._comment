Are you sure? These options work for me in Tails 0.12.1. How did you set these options?

They are eight (I think) servers run by operators that the individuals in the Tor project trust. Each of them try to keep a current view the Tor network (e.g. which nodes are working), and you, the client, continually download a consensus of these network views, i.e. for each fact in it (e.g. whether a node is working) you get what the majority of the authorities reported. For more information, please refer to [the Tor design document and specifications](https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html).

Not true. Even when using the slowest, most congested Tor nodes you are susceptible to end-to-end correlation attacks.

We are not designing Tor. [Ask the Tor developers](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk/).
