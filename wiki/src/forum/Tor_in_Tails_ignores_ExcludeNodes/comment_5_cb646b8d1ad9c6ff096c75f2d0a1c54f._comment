>Are you sure? These options work for me in Tails 0.12.1. How did you set these options?

Button \"Edit current torrc\" in vidalia Setup GUI. 
by default, theres syntax mistake in torrc:
>    SocksPort 9050 # what port to open for local application connections    
>    SocksListenAddress 127.0.0.1 # accept connections only from localhost

so first, you have to remove or newline those comments otherwise it refuses to accept any other changes

then I added my ExcludeNodes <...>and StrictNodes 1 and clicked OK.
Oh and UNCHECKED Save settings,cause that doesnt work.

Now I use **\"Apply selection only\" and it finally works well**.
>Not true. Even when using the slowest, most congested Tor nodes you are susceptible to end-to-end correlation attacks.

well youre in a way right, but the analysis of high latency comm requires other conditions to b successfull, not space to talk abt it here

u have great feedback, thx
