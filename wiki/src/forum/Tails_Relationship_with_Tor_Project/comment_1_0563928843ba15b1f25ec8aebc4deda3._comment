Tails gets some support and help from the Tor project.
The Tor Project advises to direct Bitcoin donations to Tails (and others).
Tails advises to direct non-Bitcoin donations to the Tor Project.
Yet Tails is an autonomous project, independent from The Tor Project.

I don't see what else could be clarified, so please ask *specific* questions if this is not clear enough for you :)
