The Tails Walkthrough instruction on enabling MacChanger: "If you paid attention when you started up Tails you may have noticed an odd option in the language selection menu, namely the "Enable MAC changer" entry." However, I do not see this option on start up. How to enable MacChanger? In the next upgrade, could you please include a MacChanger button?

The explanation of MacChanger in Walkthrough says users cannot be traced via the MAC number  on their NIC card. However, else where I read that they can.

Can users be traced via other GUIDs (global unique identifying) such as the serial number on Intel's processors? Thank you.
