If i am correct there is no \"threat\"

but when you visit http://www.bugs.downthemall.net (notice no S in the http ?)

and \"https everywhere\" extension will rewrite it to https://www.bugs.downthemail.net (now do you notice it now includes the S in http)

including the S on http (if any website supports it) will help to stop the middle man attack.

happy ?
