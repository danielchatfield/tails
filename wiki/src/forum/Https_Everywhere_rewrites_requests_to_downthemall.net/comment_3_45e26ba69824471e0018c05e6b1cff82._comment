I am not a recent Tail user but am a tor bundle user.

So does Tails not have the \"https Everywhere\" addon included ? if not it should be, as the tor project bundle does includes it.

And it seem the OP is only pointing out a code snippet of the addon which any user can create or edit themselves. And therefore not really an \"addon\" which any new user may be led to think that commenter number 2 is pointing out as a \"WARNING\".
