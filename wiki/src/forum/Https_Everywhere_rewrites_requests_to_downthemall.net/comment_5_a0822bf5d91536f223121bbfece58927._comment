@4 You could be correct, wish people explain stuff or points properly.

I took the OP question as a possible code snippet query (I really meant the rulesets). And to me look legit and works fine at the surface. Of course i not checked in-depth.

And just to inform others (if Tails updated as current tor bundles with the https everywhere plugin enabled). When or if you visit the website  http://www.bugs.downthemall.net it DOES rewrite it to https to me is a good thing.

And I also agree with the commentator 4 who raise the point that actual downthemall plugin is NOT a recommend plugin and you use it at your OWN risk. Other less risky methods of downloading stuff is available to use (use the search on this forum)

Slight off topic regards https everywhere plugin you can write your own rewrite codes/rulesets for websites that are not in the https everywhere ruleset database, provided that website supports https protocols.

It is pretty easy with very basic programming skill for more information on the ruleset stuff please read more at https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets

have fun and while i am off to hide under the rock :)
