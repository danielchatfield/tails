I'd like to suggest adding BitCoin and Wuala to the next iteration of TAILS. 

Here's why for BitCoin:
1. Creates plausible deniability. Instead of carrying around a second form of media containing BitCoin, a user can just deny they use BitCoin because every instance comes with BC pre-installed.
2. Eliminates the need to trust BitCount Wallet sites to access your wallet from TAILS, which are never completely secure, or spend a few minutes re-downloading and installing BC on every TAILS boot.
3. The most obvious: It's extremely convenient.
4. Does not need to store any persistent user data.

Here's why for Wuala:
1. Wuala should eliminate the need for carrying around a second data device containing the user's encrypted wallet(s).
2. Wuala requires a name and password to be entered every time it is accessed.
3. Wuala is stored encrypted by the user's login information and can't even be accessed (raw) by the Wuala administrators.
4. Does not need to store any persistent user data.

In combination, I feel these two additions would be very strong and useful. Combined with regular reinvention of wallets (Every 3-6 months), strong passwords and encrypted physical emergency back-ups the BC+Wuala combination seems to be the most secure and logical way to carry and utilize a bitcoin wallet.

Edit: Also, going hand-in-hand with these additions I also believe 7zip should be included for encryption and decryption. Or am I missing a more secure tool that is already installed?
