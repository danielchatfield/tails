They seem inject HTML on the pages you're trying to access.
According to Charlie Douglas, a Comcast spokesperson, their system would not be able to see a potential violation if the user was using a VPN.

So as fair as I know, you won't experience these annoyances while using tails, since they wont be able to detect what you're doing or to inject code on the page you're viewing.
