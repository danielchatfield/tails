>So, anyone know if Tails users are (so far) safe from Comcast's evil machinations?

Have you positively confirmed that Comcast or its subsidiaries are not sponsors of Tails or Tor?

If Comcast or its subsidiaries are indeed the ones paying for Tails or Tor, what right(s) do users like you and me have to complain about their actions and label them as \"evil machinations\"?
