If this Comcast thing is about P2P file sharing, then yes, Tails is safe if used as is, because it does *not* ship P2P file sharing software.

If it's about the web, then I don't see how Comcast could do any such thing about the Tails' web traffic.

So, the answer is: yes, Tails is probably immune to this issue, but without technical details about the issue itself, it's hard to be affirmative.
