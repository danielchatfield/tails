I completely agree. WTF are \"productivity apps\" doing on a privicy/security live distro? Who, who seeks privicy/security could possibly want them? And what about Gnome and all that crap? What the hell useful function does Gnome serve? Just more useless bloat and security holes.

To be taken seriously, Tails must strip out ALL THIS USLESS AND DANGEROUS CRAP IMMEDIATELY

A REAL Tails would be a hardened kernel booting to a Busybox prompt. With **NOTHING ELSE** installed.
