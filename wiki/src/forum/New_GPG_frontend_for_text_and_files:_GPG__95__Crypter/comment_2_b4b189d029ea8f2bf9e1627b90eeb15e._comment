There are many GPG graphical users interface (GUI) packages.  If you use ANY of them, you introduce a new layer of possibly buggy software which can possibly be used by an adversary to compromise your communications without needing to attempt cryptanalysis of encrypted messages.  Few if any of these packages have been audited for security vulnerabilities (and new audits would be regularly required).

I believe that Bruce Schneier has occasionally made these points in his blog.

GPG is text-based, and many people do initially find it hard to use.  However, it has been much more extensively scrutinized than any of the GUIs.  It is of course possible to use GPG itself unsafely; the most common error is probably failure to keep your keyring secure.

Some of us have been warning holders of US Top Secret clearances that they too are subject to surveillance by three letter agencies, more than most as a matter of fact.  The fate of former CIA chief David Petraeus illustrates an important point for anyone who uses gmail: if you allow a third party such as Google Inc to perform all your crypto processing for you, your \"encrypted\" personal email can be read by others, including potentially including cyberespionage agents, deranged former lovers, and grim visaged FBI agents.

In case someone has not heard the story and has no idea what I am talking about: US newspapers are reporting that after several friends of the former CIA chief received \"threatening\" emails, FBI investigators found that some of them appeared to have a nexus with the gmail account used by Petraeus himself.  The Untouchables used their supersnooping abilities to check the logs for this gmail account, and found that it appeared to have been accessed by someone other than Petraeus.  Huge alarm!  The investigators proceeded to read the contents of the general's emails, and discovered fairly irrefutable evidence that the longstanding rumors of an affair with his biographer-with-benefits were true.  The investigators concluded that his former lover had improperly accessed the gmail account to grab his contact list, and had then emailed \"threatening\" messages to some of these persons.  See the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal for more details.

This is only the latest in a long sequence of incidents in which top officials in each administration have ignored all the rules and compromised security.  For example, John Deutsch took home classified materials and stored them at home in unsafe ways.  These cases rarely lead to resignations and never lead to prosecutions.  Contrast the likely fate of the lowly code clerk who makes a comparable error.
