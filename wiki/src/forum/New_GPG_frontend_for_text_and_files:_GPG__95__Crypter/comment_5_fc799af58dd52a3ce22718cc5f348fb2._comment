John Leyden draws our attention to the fact that Paula Broadwell's yahoo account was among those leaked in the Stratfor scandal:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/12/cia_boss_resignation_webmail_intrigue/print.html

Robert Graham of Errata Security then cracked the md-5 hashed password used by Broadwell at this account.

Several news organizations are reporting that Petraeus and Broadwell created gmail accounts under pseudonyms to correspond \"privately\".  So presumably the emails were encrypted in transit, but could be read by Google.  And later, by FBI agents, one of who allegedly tipped Eric Cantor after become frustrated by his superior's decision to sit on the investigation until after the recent US presidential election.

There are several lessons here for anyone who might be tempted to think that simply using GPG will solve all their privacy problems.  If GPG is not used wisely, and if the user fails to address other possible security issues, the fact that GPG provides strong encryption of emails and individual files may be irrelevant to protecting privacy.
