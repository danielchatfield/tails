Never said they are, but I see my post was not as clear as it might have been.

Because it sounded like the OP was written for new users of GPG, I was attempting to explain some general points about GPG for the benefit of new users of GPG:

* GPG provides privacy and authentication for transport of emails from inbox to inbox
* this won't help if your keyring as been compromised, if a keylogger is installed on your computer, if you store decrypted messages as plaintext on an unencrypted hard drive, or if other non-GPG security vulnerabilities have been exploited
* if used properly GPG is far superior to \"encryption in the cloud\" (as is provided by gmail) because the encryption/decryption is performed on the correspondents' machines, not by Google Inc or another cloud provider.
