I think the issue here resumes to a single question:

Is it worth or not to include a GPG frontend for the benefit of users who cant (yet?) use only GPG? What is Tails objective? Very high security for the few people who are capable of using it, or less but still high security for most people?

Personaly I think a GPG frontend could be usefull, but if it introduces the a security risk well...It raises the question of why GPG front-end have not been verified..
