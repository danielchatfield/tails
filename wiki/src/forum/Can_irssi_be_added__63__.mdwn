irssi is an awesome irc client. On tor's trac there is some info on using it through tor:

[https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc)

Can this be included in future releases of Tails? Would others like to have this?
