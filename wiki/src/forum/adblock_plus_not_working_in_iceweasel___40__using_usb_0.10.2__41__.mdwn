Dear Tails,

as per topic, on some sites I'm getting adverts when using iceweasel. I am not sure if it is a bug or not. When I check the preferences, 3 lists are present (easylist USA, liste FR and DE). I have to right click an add and then filter the whole page to get rid of them (adblock image>look for pattern>'example'.com^). 

I hate ads with a passion but I'm concerned this could be a security issue?

Thought I'd best let you know.

Thanks!
