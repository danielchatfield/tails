... Previous poster here. Half my post didn't make it (it was really long) and all subsequent attempts to post the rest of my message end with \"awaiting moderation\". I first tried to post the whole message two or three days ago and received the same warning with nothing appearing since so I'm not sure if this message board is working correctly.
