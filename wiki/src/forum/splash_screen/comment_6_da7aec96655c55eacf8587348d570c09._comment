However, if your perceived threat is more likely from some administrator's passing glance (librarian/internet cafe worker) who might be very concerned to see a boot process then my piece_de_resistance_suggestion is to have a boot splash that looks like a generic full screen flash video that's loading. Nothing fancy like youtube's player with color gradients etc. - just a very generic and minimilist style flash player that you might see on some less popular video sites. It should have \"pause\" and \"play\" then a working progress bar and a full screen button at the bottom with a big animated \"play\" button in the middle of the screen.
