> Using Tails, if a downloaded file contains a trojan, would the firewall in Tails prevent it from 'phoning home'?.

In the following I'll assume you have actually *run* the trojan program (which you should not, but still). So: Probably not, if the trojan is written with Tails is mind. Possibly yes, else, if you're lucky.

> Since I myself would have run the program (the trojan/file, by clicking on it), how would the Tails firewall know whether to allow it to communicate or not without asking me?

Indeed, one should not rely on the Tails firewall to protect you from random programs you would download and run.
