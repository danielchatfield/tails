>The entity with the most resources to create trojan-horse programs is: Government.

While that statement might be true in some aspects, I believe the motivation to create viruses for Linux OS comes from companies specializing in internet security. Firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Kapersky, Trend Micro, Avira... need to generate revenue in order for corporate survival.

Twenty five years ago, my friends joked that most viruses, malware and trojan horses were created by the above companies so that the latter could make money to survive. That joke is NOT a joke anymore in todays' world.

If I were running an antivirus company, I would instruct my staff to create viruses and malware into the wild. I just need to provide excuses to justify my acts. They are:

1. The aim is to test computers' vulnerability
2. It is for research and development purposes
3. To help OS developers to build a more robust software

With the US economy teetering on the edge of the \"fiscal cliff\" as of today, anemic economic recovery in North America and the ever-deepening Eurozone crises, many internet security companies are facing dwindling sales. Just think about it: if your company doesn't create viruses and malware for Linux, some other company surely will.
