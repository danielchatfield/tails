>create a \"need\" for a proprietary linux antivirus which probably acts as a better rootkit by spying on its users.

How true, how true.

If my company specializing in internet security solutions does not creat a need for antivirus software for Linux distros by developing and releasing viruses and malware into the wild, my competitors will.

It is all about $$$ and cents. (When will Linux users ever learn this basic tenet of corporate survival.....??)
