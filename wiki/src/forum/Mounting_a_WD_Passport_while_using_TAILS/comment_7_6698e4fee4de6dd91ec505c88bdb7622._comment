In deed, it's hard to find a way to encrypt datas, *and* to have the possiblity to access them with both Windows and Linux. I would consider Windows as non-safe-enough, and choosed not to type my passphrase on this  Operating System.

Why don't you split you hard-drive in two partition:

-one in FAT32, not encrypted, for your music and video

-one with your sensitive datas, [[encrypted with LUKS|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]], that you access only with Tails/Linux

Good lucks!
