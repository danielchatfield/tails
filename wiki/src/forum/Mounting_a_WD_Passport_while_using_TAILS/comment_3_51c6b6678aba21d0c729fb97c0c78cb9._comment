It seems that the \"WD My Passport\" drives is compatible only with Windows and Mac OS. On [the ubuntu forum](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1284828), people founds a workaround to access it from GNU/Linux, but it's quite complicated (requires to run a windows in a virtual machine to unlock it).

Unfortunatly, there are good chances that you won't be able to access this drive from Tails. :-/

This is the downside of using hardware encryption, when the vendor don't bother about thinking that GNU/Linux could also be a market, they do not provide binaries or drivers for this platform. 

As they are proprietary, the only chance to be able to unlock this kind of drive in GNU/Linux would be either that someone try to reverse engineer the vendor software, or that enough people harass the vendor to write one for GNU/Linux distributions. Good luck!

When seomone begin to use GNU/Linux, she should then pay attention when choosing hardware that it is known to be compatible with it. But it's getting better in this area.
