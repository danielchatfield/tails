>In deed, it's hard to find a way to encrypt datas, and to have the possiblity to access them with both Windows and Linux.

Quite. Despite [suggestions to the contrary](https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt/index.en.html) I find Truecrypt to offer by far the best combination of security, convenience and portability.
