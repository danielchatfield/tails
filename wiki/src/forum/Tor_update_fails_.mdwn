your Instructions are flawed. I even tried the irc chat but no one has a solution.

"apt-get update && apt-get install tor && service start" 

doesn't work bash message is:
could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (permission denied) 

Yes I used sudo even and it wouldn't install. It downloaded them fine but no joy.
