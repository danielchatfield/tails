If I read docs correctly, these are the steps:

- configure a persistent volume, and turn on the \"dotfiles\" feature
- start tails with the persistent volume activated
- install your addons
- copy \"/home/amnesia/.mozilla\" directory into \"/live/persistent/XXX_unlocked/dotfiles\" (XXX is a placeholder, it could be sdb1 or sdb2 or whatever)
- restart tails with the persistent volume activated, your addons should be already installed

Beware that I didn't test it yet. Can someone confirm if this method is correct?
