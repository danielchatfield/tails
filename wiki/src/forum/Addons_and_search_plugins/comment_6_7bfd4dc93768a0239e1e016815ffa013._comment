Is there any danger in changing 
`extensions.torbutton.resize_new_windows` to *false*?

Is there any reason why the default is to resize new windows?

It's quite annoying having to manually expand each time a new browser window is opened.

What about checking \"zoom text only\" under \"view\"?

Any danger?
