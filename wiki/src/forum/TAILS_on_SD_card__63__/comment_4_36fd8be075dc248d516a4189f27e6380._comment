> I can install it on SD card but the BIOS is not capable of booting from it, so it's no use for me

In my situation (Eeepc 901), I had to define the SD card reader as one of the Main Harddisks before to see it appearing in the Device Boot menu order (I'm actually not sure of the names used here, give a sign if you also use an Eepc and I will look deeper).

Good luck
