i have an iomega network storage device called,,,,,,, wait for it ....... 'cloud'

my wifi router connection provides a DHCP service that resolves the name 'cloud' to an IP-Address but i need to keep entering my web-key to get a connection because the key never seems to save when i re-boot.

Once connected to the wifi i would expect taills to see the DHCP server and resolve 'Cloud' to an ip-address but this does not happen.

so my next step was to edit the etc/hosts file to add a line like
192.168.1.77      cloud

Now i can connect and see the files by entering the server name as 'cloud' from file browser and i bookmark the drive.

trouble comes when i re-boot because the file broswer bookmark has gone and when i try ping -c 1 cloud it won't work after a re-boot because the etc/hosts file is over-written and the line i added has gone.

seems to me that any changes to files in the file system folder get restored to the original file on re-boot 

I keep trying F1 help but i keep getting messages like
'Unable to load the page' the request URI 'ghelp:user-guide(HASH)gosnautilus-1' is invalid so looks like help is a no go.
