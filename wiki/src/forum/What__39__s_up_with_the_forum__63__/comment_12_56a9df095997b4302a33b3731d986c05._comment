It was removed because (1) it doesn't work, and (2) it put a lot of (unnecesary) load on the web server.

1. It *did* work! It's the current *mtime* (\"Updated\") data which is at fault... the *age* (\"Started\") remains correct. Please have another (good) look.

2. Does sorting by *age* rather than *mtime* really make that much of a difference to load?
