@ OP:

> The \"update time\" of a great swathe (though not quite all) of threads has just been reset... resulting in their listing order being shuffled on the forum page. However there doesn't appear to be anything new in the the threads' histories to explain this.

I'm unsure of why it happens, but it's certainly not deliberate and is annoying myself from time to time. It seems to have some sort of correlation with when a comment is reverted, which is how we deal with spam. Yes, this forum is a hack. :)

> IMO it looks like a way to skew threads so some of the more security/privacy minded \"pests\" making threads won't be answered due to the forum sliding cointelpro tactic. 

Nice try. :)

@ comment 10:

> The sorting correction was deliberately removed

It was removed because (1) it doesn't work, and (2) it put a lot of (unnecesary) load on the web server.
