>I compared the by \"age\" sort to what's seen in recentchanges. Threads were not always bumped. It all looked very random.

According to [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/pagespec/sorting/)
>age - List pages from the most recently created to the oldest.

>mtime - List pages with the most recently modified first.

The age sort is not supposed to show thread bumps. Only sort by original posting date.
The mtime sort doesn't show thread bumps the way you would expect either. Only sort by when the original posting message was last changed.
Since this forum is actually a blog, the sorting only applies to the original posting message and ignores any comments.

>Apparently it turned out to be an easy DoS attack :). At least that was what I was told by people with access to that information.

Makes sense. I read somewhere in the abyss that it is not easy for git to sort by file creation date, and I believe the age sort is asking exactly that. I thought for a second that this might be remedied by removing the inline archive parameter and using the inline show parameter instead, but that would still require git to sort every post file by creation date only to show the top results.

Sorry for fucking things up, but it's what I do best. :)
