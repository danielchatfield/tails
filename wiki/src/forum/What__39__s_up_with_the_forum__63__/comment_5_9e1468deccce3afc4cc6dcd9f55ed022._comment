I hope you are the only one on this forum who regards the more security/privacy minded folks as pests. Your mentality will only serve to drive away potential users.

If Tails expects more widespread adoption of its software, they should expect to receive more requests for help, especially from newbies and converts such as myself.

If Tails hopes to garner more support (read: donations) from its current and potential users, it will have to be more customer-centric.
