> It did work! It's the current mtime (\"Updated\") data which is at fault... the age (\"Started\") remains correct. Please have another (good) look.

Let me quote from [the commit that reverted this change](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=commit;h=dc0bc791231aa4d967b3d4820e08ec1c92b44d76):

    A quick look at the RecentChanges page is enough to show this \"de-shuffling\"
    does not work.

And that is what I did. I compared the by \"age\" sort to what's seen in [[recentchanges]]. Threads were not always bumped. It all looked very random.

Just bear with this hack of a forum for a little while longer. We're moving to a proper system Soonâ„¢.

> Does sorting by age rather than mtime really make that much of a difference to load?

Apparently it turned out to be an easy DoS attack :). At least that was what I was told by people with access to that information.
