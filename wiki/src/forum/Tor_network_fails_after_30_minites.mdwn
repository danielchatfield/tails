I can run the tor network and tor browser on my win 7 system with no problems.  When I boot the system with the tails live CD, it connects to the network for about 30 minutes and completely fails. I can open the Vidalia control panel and view the network.  It keeps trying but shows empty in the connection field and failed in the status field,  The browser shows "waiting to long message"  Everything else works solid on this computer as far as the OS goes.  Does anyone have a clue what to do about this issue?
