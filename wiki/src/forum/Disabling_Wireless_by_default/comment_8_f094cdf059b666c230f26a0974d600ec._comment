>make a tinfoil tent, in a square shape, inside your computer room. be sure to properly ground it and any ventilation shafts should be properly shielded, too. your whole living space could also work if you want to block wireless everywhere and there is lining walls with tinfoil and special paint and wallpaper to disable wireless. 

Don't be daft. Mesh is much better. It's easier to handle, more durable, you can still breathe when inside and light passes through.

Tinfoil is definitely best reserved for hats.

OTOH, I wonder if I could fashion myself a mesh zentai/catsuit ...something like the gear high-voltage line gimps get to wear. That would stop the rays from reading/controlling my thoughts AND stop their castration beams AND stop the weird signals which make my arm tingle/numb while I sleep AND I bet I'd look snazzy in it too.

Tinfoil is dead. Long live mesh.
