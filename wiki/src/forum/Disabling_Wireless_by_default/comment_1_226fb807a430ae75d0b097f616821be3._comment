Here is an address? 123678

Who's is it? That is why you don't have to worry about MAC address unless someone can connect your IP to it, and then connect you to it. 

Even if it was 123678 Main Street, what city is it? Or what state? Or if it was only Main Street, what is the address.  With a MAC address, of 01:02:03:04:05:06, the first 3 are the manufacturer and that is easy to find, and it may or may not narrow down the type of computer you have because the card may work in various brands. The last numbers 04-06 are unique to your computer, like a finger print, but it would take a lot of work, even if possible, to get the manufacturer to track down who bought it and where, etc. And how could anyone be sure that same card was in the same computer?

Your MAC address does not go out over the Internet, but your router's might, and then then next router will take over and use its MAC. Yours is long forgotten and it goes by your IP now (and that's where Tor/Tails comes in, by hiding your IP). You don't say what kind of system you have but if Windows, type cmd in you start field to start it, then type ipconfig /all, and you can see this information for yourself.
