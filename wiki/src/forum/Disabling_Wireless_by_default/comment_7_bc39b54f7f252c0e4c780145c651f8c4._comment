make a tinfoil tent, in a square shape, inside your computer room. be sure to properly ground it and any ventilation shafts should be properly shielded, too. your whole living space could also work if you want to block wireless everywhere and there is lining walls with tinfoil and special paint and wallpaper to disable wireless.
