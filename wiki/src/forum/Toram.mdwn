Earlier I needed to free up a USB port temporarily, so I decided to try toram command on boot as a one off, and found it to be surprisingly quick and efficient, and seems to me to be a better way to go from here on out. 

Just wondered if there were any security issues with this over and above say booting with DVD or USB? 

Is the fact you are storing much more data on RAM a problem when wiping RAM on shutdown? 

Also, I read on an old post that said Tails could only use 2.5Gb of RAM, so has this changed in the last 6 months? I have 4Gb and would like to think that I can use all of it. 

Thanks.
