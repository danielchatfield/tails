It seems that very few users have this certificate installed, thus the vast majority of users will get such a warning. 

This is surely confusing for the average user and most will no doubt find installing the certificate beyond them.

(Note that the URL you gave has a link,
\"Click here if you want to import the root certificate into Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x/6.x\" but nothing for Firefox or even newer versions of IE (Are 5 and 6 even still supported?) )

Have you considered getting a more standard, widely recognized certificate? 

I see that the https://torproject.org has one. Perhaps they could help you with this somehow?
