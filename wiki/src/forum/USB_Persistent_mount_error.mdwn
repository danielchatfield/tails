Have used a 32GB USB with a persistent volume - all worked well until this week.  Had some important documents saved.  

When enabling persistent volume at login - it hangs.  When I login without persistent I can login fine.  I have tried the Disk Utility as advised elsewhere - I can unlock the persistent drive with my passphrase - but when I then try to mount I get an error.  Also if I use the check file system/repair it tells me the File System is NOT clean - left it running for ages (3 hours) and nothing.

The Mount error tells me: Filesystem drive not installed and the detail is as follows:

Error mounting: mount: block device /dev/mapper/udisks-luks-uuid-(lots of numbers) is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mapper/udisks-luks-uuid-2(more numbers),
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so

I have deleted the numbers as I am sure not required - the wrong fs type???  Have no idea.

I tried to reinstall the Tails 0.14 back onto the USB using the DVD disk and then the USB installer - in order to clone - thinking this may just re-install the missing driver!!!  However, that also did not work - message that TAILS already installed and read only!!!


PLease can somebody help - or is this just hopeless!!

Thanks for any help
