> it so difficult to quickly field these questions?

Not everything easy is a good idea. I think answering many unrelated questions in a single thread would send a signal that this way of asking questions is welcome, which it is not. Such a thread would be hard to read and understand, which would defeat the purpose of answering at all, waste my time, and would be a disservice to other Tails users.
