I'm certainly not one to shy away from being critical of \"TAILS\" when I feel they deserve such. (For example, I've criticized the TAILS devs for not identifying themselves and not even providing any explanation for *why*, etc. Most recently, I made it unequivocally clear that I was nothing short of appalled at how they handled the serious concerns that were raised in the thread \"AdBlock Plus icon missing!\")

But *in this case*, I think the replies from \"TAILS\" are quite reasonable and appropriate. I'm afraid that *here*, at least, the one beng unreasonable is *you*.
