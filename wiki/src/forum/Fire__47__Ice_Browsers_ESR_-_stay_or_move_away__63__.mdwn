"The latest 14.0 release of Webconverger, a browser-only operating system for web kiosks, drops the extended support release (ESR) of Firefox in favour of the current major version of the browser, Firefox 14.0.1. The open source OS had previously used the mainline version of Firefox until Webconverger 11, but later switched to ESR in March with the release of version 12. Speaking to The H, project founder and lead developer Kai Hendry said that <i>the change was the result of feedback from his paying customers <b>and bugs encountered in the 10.x branch</b></i>; his company, Webconverger Limited, sells custom-configured versions of the OS for use by, for example, banks, medical practices and libraries.
