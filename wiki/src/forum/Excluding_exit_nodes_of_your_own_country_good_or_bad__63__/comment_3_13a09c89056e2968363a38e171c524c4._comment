>please, how can be done? This can be very important for me. Is simple way to do?

I exclude the whole axis of evil...

    echo -e \"\nExcludeNodes {us},{gb},{il}\n\" | sudo tee -a /etc/tor/torrc

Be careful though - the Tor docs **explicitly** warn **against** using \"excludenodes\" :-(

I'm also not convinced of either the reliability or value of the geographical data. Especially for inferring the likelihood of governmental influence.
