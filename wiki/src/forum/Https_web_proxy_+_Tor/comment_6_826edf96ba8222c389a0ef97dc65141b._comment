@ comment 5:

Thats why I said https proxy not a transparent one. The connection should look like this:

Me > Relay > exit node > \"encryption\" > Https proxy > \"encryption\" > Destination

Does that make any difference? 

Faking cert is less likely to succeed if you change exit node and https proxy frequently.

Now how do you find that? Should be reasonable
