Alright, I'm not certain exactly what you mean by \"https web proxy\". But what I am certain of is--whatever it is--it can't create an encrypted connection to a site that doesn't support encryption. The only way you'll ever get end-to-end encryption is is if both ends (i.e. your computer and the destination) support it encryption. That's obvious, right?

But perhaps there's some so of misunderstanding here. So just to be clear, end-to-end encryption over Tor is already possible if the destination supports it. Like this one. You can visit <https://tails.boum.org/> with or without Tor and it would be encrypted end-to-end.
