I think the Tails developers know how to chain a socks proxy after a tor exit node safely, but because of some reasons they don't want to share that. Probably they can also implement easily a standard tool in Tails that makes chaining socks proxies after Tor exit nodes very easy and safe without firewall complexities etc., but they don't do it. 

@Tails devs: Tails is very nice and we like it very much but please give us a solution to chain socks after Tor easily and safely without any other dangerous side effects. We need it badly to so circumvent Tor exit node IP blacklisting.

It would be very appreciated!
