Would it be safe or private to email someone as long as you signed up for an email address without having to put your name or anything to it at sign up for it (some provider that doesn't make you)? If not, then what about if I go to like a local library or something like that? Would using tor help in this situation maybe? 

Kind of confused on how to email people being privacy minded but kind of newbish to this stuff. I was going to try a method of encryption to contact him but I just think encryption is too hard for the non-privacy minded people you wish to communicate with to follow through with so I was wondering if the situation above I mentioned would be ok maybe to get around encryption for now because though its readable its not traceable I guess and so I have privacy?


P.S. Is this ok to ask questions like this? Am I at the right place?
