How did you create your USB?

If you still have the .iso for Tails 0.10, try issuing the following command to recreate it (using the root account with the # prompt:

    # dd if=tails-0.10.iso of=/dev/sdx

where sdx is the device name of the USB when plugged in and you need to substitute the actual device letter, e.g. a,b,c,d,e,f,g,...etc. for x.

This means that you do not need create a MBR or a device partition - use the Disk Utility to reformat without a partition.
