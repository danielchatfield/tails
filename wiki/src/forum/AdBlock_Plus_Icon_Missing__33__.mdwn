[ABP Icon is here with 0.16~rc1 !!]

Something very strange with AdBlock Plus in TAILS.

No icon for ABP in add-on bar.

I check ABP preferences and find that the box next-to "Show in add-on bar" is checked.

But no ABP icon to be found.

Then, when I check ABP preferences a little later, I find "show in add-on bar" UNchecked. 

So I try to re-check it but cannot at first. A little later I am able to check the box but doing so does not change anything; no icon for ABP can be found!
