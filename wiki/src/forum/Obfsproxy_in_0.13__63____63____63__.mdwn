I'm delighted to read that Tails 0.13 is to include Tor 0.2.3.x and that the Tor team now consider the 0.2.3 branch to be stable enough for our consumption.

Does this mean that Tails 0.13 will now include Obfsproxy? Obviously Obfsproxy would be tremendous addition, potentially enabling those who need Tails the most (those living under regimes which execute policies of obstruction/persecution against Tor) to connect, communicate and benefit from all that Tails has to offer.

Please say "yes"! :D
