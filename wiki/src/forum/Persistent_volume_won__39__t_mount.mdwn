I have tails installed to a pny usb 2.0 4 GB flash drive with a 2.5 GB persistent volume.  I had it configured to save everything to the persistent volume with the exception of keyring information, which I inadvertantly omitted.  I used it this way with no problem for about a week, then I went to the configure persistent volume utility and made that change.  On reboot, the system would hang when attempting to mount the persistent volume at the login screen, regardless of read-only mode.  Attempts to mount the persistent partition from Mint result in the error: "Stale NFS file handle.."  Any ideas?  I would simply reinstall but I have one document with some information I need on that partition...
