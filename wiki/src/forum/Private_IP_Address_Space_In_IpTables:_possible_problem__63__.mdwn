I notice in Tails testing version iptables includes *private networks*:

Let's suppose my ISP is using one of these blocks for routing, should this cause problems in routing? (as these are assigned to 'lan' via iptables)

This might explain a lot of dropped packets in localhost-to-localhost UDP, TCP, and ICMP messages I'm seeing in dmesg output.
