### Tails 0.10 not booting on Acer TM8215

My Notebook Acer TM8215, intel Centrino Duo, RAM 4GB.

After using Tails 0.7 without problems, I tried V 0.10.1 and after that V 0.10.2, but both would not boot. Booting ends up with a light gray screen, in the left upper corner 2 lines of text, white on black background:

    1st line: Loading blahblah
    2nd line: #.###### firewire_ohci:Failure to set Link Power Status

"#" seems to be a line number. Under these lines a white blinking curser. No keyboard input possible, only way out is turning off the laptop.

The isos are MD5/SHA checked ok. 10.1 on a CD, 10.2 installed on an USB Pendrive using Universal USBInstaller, as had been advised here. 

Any ideas, any cheatcodes? I'd love to continue using  Tails in its neww version, if only it would boot......
