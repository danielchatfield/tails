Hi all,

I need to specify my exit node so that it originates from one area.
For example i am trying to post an ad up on a market place here in Australia but the ad is continually declined as the IP is originating from USA or Europe for example and the site is based off of location based trading.

I have tried messing with Socks5 but that does not seem to have any effect on the Exit Node, also i know it can be done via etc/Tor/Torrc however i can't quite figure out what needs to be changed.

If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated :)

Cheers.
