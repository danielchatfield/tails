Since booting from DVD works, maybe you could use the Tails DVD as a bootdisk for a USB stick (if you have one). Just [install Tails on a USB stick](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html), then reboot. Pop in the Tails DVD and USB stick and boot from DVD. In the boot menu press tab and [change the following in the boot options](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/index.en.html):
    
    live-media=removable 
    
Change that to:
    
    live-media=removable-usb
    
When Tails has started you can remove the DVD and it will continue to run from the USB stick.   
Sorry, I don't know anything about USB-HDD's.
