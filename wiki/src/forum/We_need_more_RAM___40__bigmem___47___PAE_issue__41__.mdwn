Hi,

TAILS is only showin 2 GB of RAM but I have 8 GB installed. Since TAILS is 32bit only, it should show 4 GB?!
Maybe this misbehaviour is caused by the issue with the debian kernel described here:

<http://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/questions/294/Debian+isn%27t+showing+all+my+ram!>

So is there any chance to get a fix with either
- a bigmem kernel
- or even PAE support?

(64bit would be the best, but I read in the discussions below that it is not so easy to get a 64bit-TAILS working.)
