i agree with you, but other problems / other solutions... 
(mac changing / not initializing harddrives in the first place / only installing software out of official repositories, etc, etc..). 

And of course a unique system setup always bears the risk of a unique finger print getting leaked, but there is always situations where the preinstalled software is  just not enough. And those setups differ a lot from user to user. To cope with that, Tails already has a great persistance concept, for example.
