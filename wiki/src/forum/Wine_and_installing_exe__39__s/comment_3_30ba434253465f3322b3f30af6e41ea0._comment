>The reason I want Crapcleaner is that I want to sell an old harddrive, and always felt that CCleaner was the best option for wiping data, and is what I'm familiar with.

There's an abundance of excellent stuff already in Tails to do this. Sort of Tails' niche ;o)

>As for Wine, I install it as part of a package and it takes like 20 seconds to install, so is no biggie. I just wanted to know if it was safe.

Cool. Just be (very) careful what you run with it (obviously)

>As for Winrar, again this is familiarity, because I can't get Unrar to open nearly any of my rar files, and Winrar takes like 10 seconds to install with Wine. I don't know what else to install in Linux.

Fair enough. There are several tools you could try. A plugin for 7zip springs to mind but if you're happy with what you're used to ...including the whole Wine thing ...fine! 

Thanks for the resource recommendations, I will go take a look now. Cheers.

No problem. Good luck. B-)
