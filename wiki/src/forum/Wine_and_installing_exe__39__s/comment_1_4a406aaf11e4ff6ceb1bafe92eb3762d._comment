It's very large! ;o)

Why do you want crapcleaner on tails?

The Debian project's \"squeeze\" package repo is the sensible place to find .deb files. You could try somewhere like getdeb if you feel like chancing your arm (or what ever bit of anatomy you're hoping to protect by using Tails) 

Is all this really necessary for winrar? There are (obscure) rar tools native to Linux.
