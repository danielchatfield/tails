The reason I want Crapcleaner is that I want to sell an old harddrive, and always felt that CCleaner was the best option for wiping data, and is what I'm familiar with.

As for Wine, I install it as part of a package and it takes like 20 seconds to install, so is no biggie. I just wanted to know if it was safe.

As for Winrar, again this is familiarity, because I can't get Unrar to open nearly any of my rar files, and Winrar takes like 10 seconds to install with Wine. I don't know what else to install in Linux.

Thanks for the resource recommendations, I will go take a look now. Cheers.
