>I'd rather not clutter the GUI

A little \"back\" button is \"clutter\"?

>It seems to me rebooting is easy enough.

First of all, unless I've missed something, the only way to reboot at that stage is by holding the power button down until the computer powers itself off or otherwise cutting power, and then powering-on again. 

This is hardly smooth or \"elegant\"-- to say nothing about the risks-to and completely unnecessary wear on hardware that such crude powering-off could involve.

Secondly, powering-off and then booting all over again takes *many* times longer and consumes far more electricity than simply going back one screen; a complete waste of time as well as energy.

I'm beginning to wonder whether you sleep and eat on the floor, in order to avoid \"cluttering\" your home with a table and bed...Or turn lights on and off by resetting the whole circuit/fuse, in order to avoid the \"clutter\" of light-switches...
