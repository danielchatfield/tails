> A little \"back\" button is \"clutter\"?

No, but if we thoughtlessly add every possible button someone
asks for corner-case reasons, then the result will no doubt be
a cluttered GUI. Hence the need for someone to play the not-nice
role and argue why we should not add that one. Today,
that \"someone\" is me. Not that I find it particularly exciting.

Unplugging / ejecting the boot medium should be enough.
(Documented on [[doc/advanced_topics/cold_boot_attacks]], where
most expected users of this feature would look at, I hope.)

I had a good laugh (thank you!), but my sleeping and eating
personal preferences are barely related to the question at hand.

I think you are comparing something that, apparently, looks
necessary to you (table and bed), with something that you are the
first one to ask for since the few months tails-greeter has been
around here.
