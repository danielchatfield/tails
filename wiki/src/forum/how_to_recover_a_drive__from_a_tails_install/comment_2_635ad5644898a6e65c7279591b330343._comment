From what you say it sounds like you already overwritten the FAT tables and root directories, which makes restoring any data very challenging and time consuming.

I am afraid I cannot help you how to do it, but I think DEFT LiveCD have utilities for scanning devices for data files. Maybe give it a go:

Anyway, the real solution should have been to restore the data from any of your backups, because you got backups right, do you?
