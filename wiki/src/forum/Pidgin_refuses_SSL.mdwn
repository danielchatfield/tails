hi

I tried to go into irc with ircs protocol and port 6667 in pidgin which comes with Tails, but it fails saying "SSL handshake failure". I think the reason might be incorrect clock. Does anyone know how to fix this?

N.B. Anyone can test this by trying to go to any irc server that supports SSL and see the result.
