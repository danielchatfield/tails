You're using a mac. If so, however tails is formatting the stick seems to be unusable to mac hardware. 
It's a worry; with Macs accounting for 14% of all pc sales in 2011 and increasing that share by about 1-2% per year you would thing developers would start giving it some serious attention...
Until tails developers hand back control of the formatting process you're stuck with the live USB/CD & that seems to be that.

Or your not using a mac in which case you need to start posting more details. :)
