Patronizing and acting as if our resources were infinite helps in no way. See [[todo/UEFI]].

We get almost no usable bug reports / help / testing results from Apple hardware users, and we don't own such hardware, so no wonder this is badly supported. But you already know all that.

This is a bug. Either in Tails USB Installer, or in the computer's BIOS / firmware.
Please try that USB stick on another / a few other computer(s) and report back.
