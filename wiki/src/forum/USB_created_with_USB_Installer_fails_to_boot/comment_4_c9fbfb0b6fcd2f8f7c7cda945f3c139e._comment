No patronising tone was implied. I'm sorry my comment gave that impression. When I say developers I mean the developer community contributing in general not just Tails developers including (as you rightly mention) users submitting reports.Tails & Debian are most certainly not alone in this respect. 

The fact is more and more people are switching to Apple hardware whether traditional developers like it or not. Hopefully the situation will improve. I will at least do my best personally to support your project and as I learn more, so will the people on these boards.

Apologies once again. I greatly appreciate what Tails developers are doing and I understand resources are limited of course.
