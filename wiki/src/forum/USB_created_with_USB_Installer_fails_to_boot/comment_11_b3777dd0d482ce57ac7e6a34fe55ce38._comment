 Did the following to get samsung to boot:
 Keep usb live stick out of the machine.
 Enter bios  hit f9 and go to advanced section of bios and 
disable \"EDB (execute disable bit)\", and 
disable fast bios. go to boot section and change boot order. Put \"usb 
hdd\" first. could not get live dvd to work.
 Hit f10. Let the machine goto window 7. Then do A complete shutdown not
A restart.  Put the live usb stick in the usb 2.0 port on
the right side of laptop. Then turn on laptop. Good luck.
 Did not need to hit \"ESC\" or f4 at anytime.

 If you do not get grub boot selection after a install reboot with live usb again
and than go to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair. work great for fixing multi-
boots.
