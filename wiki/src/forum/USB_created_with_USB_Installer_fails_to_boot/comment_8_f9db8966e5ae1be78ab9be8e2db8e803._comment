I've found the solution to my problems and most likely the problems of the original poster.

Turns out the Samsung series 5 and 7 are touchy when it comes to booting from usb and the problem has nothing to do with Tails. Booted fine in other pcs and now on this one as well.

You have to make sure to boot from a USB 2.0 slot, not a 3.0 and you may have to change other BIOS settings than boot order. More info here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1935699
