if my ISPs-router is compromised is there a man-in-the middle-attack possible?
i know there are 5 hardcodeed IP-adresses from the developers which are encrypted. but if you know this adresses can you act as them an start am m-i-m-attack? by acting as those adresses and whatever is necessary to do this?

can i chack this somehow if this is ok in case that is possible?

my router is based on linux so its possible to do alot on it...

thanks fot any answers!
