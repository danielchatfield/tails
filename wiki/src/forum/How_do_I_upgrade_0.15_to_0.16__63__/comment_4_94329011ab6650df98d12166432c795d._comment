For your information I have read the documentation. The part I'm having trouble with is loading 0.16 onto the usb which my computer is currently running off (powered by 0.15) I'm not great with computers and was seeking assistance... Not a bullshit responce that says nothing. If you are able to pull your head out of your arse and actually be of some assistance feel free :)
