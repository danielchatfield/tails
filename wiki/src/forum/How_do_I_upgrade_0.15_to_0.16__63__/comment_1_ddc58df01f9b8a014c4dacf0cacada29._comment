Have you [RTFM](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)?

If you're new to the internet, it's usually considered good manners to read the documentation before bothering people for things which the trouble has *already* been taken to explain.

If questions or problems remain, after reading [the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html), it is usually considered good manners to search the forum before bothering people for things which the trouble has *already* been taken to explain.

If, after reading [the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html) and reviewing related threads on the forum, and finding no answer there, *then* it's reasonable to suppose that your question is as yet unanswered. In this (surprisingly unusual) case, it is usually considered good manners to invest the small effort necessary to draft a clear and informative question. For example, looking at OP to this thread, it's conspicuous that so much essential information has been omitted that it's impossible to provide OP with a specific answer. Without carefully describing the specific nature of your \"problem\", it's *impossible* for anyone to offer OP an alternative to bothering to read [the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html) other than by pasting entire pages of [the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html) into this thread. Pasting entire pages of [the documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html) into this forum every time someone failed to find an answer for themselves and write a precise question would quickly render this forum unusable. Then where would you be?
