@ OP:

I think Commentators 6,7 are correct.  I suggest you try this:

* download the Tails 0.16 iso and the accompanying detached signature file from this website (tails.boum.org)
* verify the 0.16 iso using the Tails signing key
* burn the 0.16 iso to a blank DVD
* reboot using the new Tails 0.16 DVD
* plug in a second USB and use the Tails provided script to put an encrypted volume on it
* plug in your old bootable USB and backup your personal files to the second USB
* use another Tails provided script to make a new bootable USB, overwriting your old bootable USB

(If you can't find the two scripts I mentioned on your new Tails DVD, say so and we'll help you find them.)

And of course I echo everyone else in saying to Commentator 1 that gratituous abuse has no place on this forum.  I don't know what is up with that poster, I really don't.
