Probably clicked \"OK\" without reading that your OS was asking you whether it should remember the passphrase... doing it once is enough.

One slightly safer way would be to look how the USB stick partitions / filesystems / encryption layout looks like in the GNOME Disk Utility.

The best, but more involved technically, way would probably be to write a known pattern on the filesystem, and see if you can recover it from the USB stick block device, in Tails without entering the passphrase.

Use GNOME Disk Utility.
