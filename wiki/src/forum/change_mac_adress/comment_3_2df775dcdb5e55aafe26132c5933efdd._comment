>macchanger -a eth0

In the instructions given in the first reply in the thread you linked, the command given is:

    macchanger -a **-e** eth0

\"where eth0 is assumed to be the network interface with the Internet connection.\"

For WiFi its usually **wlan0** (If that doesn't work, try *wlan1* )

The other thread also suggest using **sudo** (before each command).

I have had success following the instructions in the other thread with two of three wireless adapters that I have tried.
