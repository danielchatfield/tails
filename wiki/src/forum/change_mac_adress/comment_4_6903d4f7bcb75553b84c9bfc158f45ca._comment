The asterisks that appear in my previous post above are NOT part of the command!

Following the markdown formatting key (linked just below the text box), I had intended to make \"-e\" appear in bold-text. 

I probably should have realized, however, that this would not work within the code formatting I was using. (By indenting four spaces)
