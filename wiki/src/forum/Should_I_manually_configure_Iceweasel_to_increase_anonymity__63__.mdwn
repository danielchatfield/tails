I've recently found out about Tor and I2p and their hidden services and eepsites respectively. I used to use TBB and its Firefox browser to view hidden services and browse the normal web, and I had looked into guides to configure the browser further by disabling java, javascript, flash, cookies, cache and also by disabling some items in about:config like prefetch-next etc.....

Also I used a separate normal Firefox explicitly for I2p in private mode with flash, javascript, cache and cookies disabled. I also added Noscript, adblockplus, HTTPS everywhere, Betterprivacy and ghostery addons. Is this overkill?

So what I want to know is, is it safe to use Tails on my home Windows 7 PC to browse eepsites and download torrents through I2psnark? What will my ISP see if running Tor and I2p in Tails at the same time?

Should I manually configure Iceweasel in respect of disabling the mentioned options or adding extra addons? Does manually configuring Iceweasel increase or decrease anonymity and traceability?

Surely disabling more things in the browser and checking the results via the Jon Do ip-check.info website to get more green attributes is a good idea?

Thanks!
