If something happend like this,
Shutdown of Power and communication... i hope you can can add this on your project and make something really quick. Otherwise, there are only walkie talkie for communications.

You gonna be Heros if you can add a functional independent commnication tool into tails. In my opinion, something major will happen soon.
