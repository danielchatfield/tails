Firstly I would like to thank Tails for their outstanding software. I have thrown windows in the bin and converted all my encripted drives from TrueCrypt to GNOME . The included NoScript software was an important step forward, it works well. For the first time in years I have confidence that I can use my computer privately without the loss of functionality or months of study on the command line. My whole life feels like reality television on cctv cameras, I now have a place of privacy and peace

I have been waiting for the much anticipated version .10 which has support for html5. When researching online, video can be the quickest way to get relevant, easily understood information. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words but at the moment it involves rebooting and loading Ubuntu. My guess is that this issue will be the biggest obstacle for the average Joe adopting Tails. What is needed more than anything else is for there to be one platform for all tasks

Has anyone had any success using html5 with videos online? 
Youtube has a trial called testtube for html5 but I havent been able to find any which work, any suggestions please?
