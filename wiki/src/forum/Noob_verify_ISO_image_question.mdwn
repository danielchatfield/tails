I have limited technical knowledge but am trying to educate myself as I go so please excuse my ignorance. In Tails Getting Started/Verify the ISO Image Using other operating systems Firefox, it says to select the Checksum on that page starting with 5811 and check it against the ISO image of the tails iso.pgp file using CheckIt which I have. Firstly is that correct, to check the ISO I downloaded against the one listed on that page, and secondly if that is correct, what do I do when it says they do not match? Thanks for any advice!
