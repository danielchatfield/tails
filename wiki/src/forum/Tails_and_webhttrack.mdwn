Hi,

I would like to use webhttrack within Tails, so I installed the last version `apt-get install webhttrack=3.46.1-1`.

A menu entry is added in Applications/Internet. When I click on this, it opens in Iceweasel the following URL : http://amnesia:8080/

Unfortunatelly, the connection fails.

Any clue?

Thanks,  
Tom
