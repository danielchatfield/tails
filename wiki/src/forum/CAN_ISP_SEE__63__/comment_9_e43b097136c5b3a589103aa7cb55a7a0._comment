>The warning in the official Tor documentation states clearly that if an ISP \"REALLY wants to see\" (as the OP put it) what a user is doing, (and if they have the resources), then they can.

It is a near impossible task as far as the tracking by the ISP is concerned. At any given point in time there may be hundreds of users using the same Tor nodes.

How is the ISP able to tell that particular connection coming out of that Tor exit node is yours?
