>if you use bridges, they won't even know you are connecting to a Tor node.

So what will the ISP see then?

I mean, they'll still see:
a) that there *is* traffic on your account, and,
b) that such traffic is not transparent the way ordinary traffic is

So even if one uses a bridge to connect to Tor, one's ISP will still realize that *some* kind of proxy tool is being used, right?

Thus, other than when necessary to even *connect* to the Tor network, I don't quite see what using a bridge actually accomplishes.
