When i try to boot tails from usb,it gets stuck on the first screen for more than 2 minutes,and then dont load totally,showing me these error messages:

Exec:1/bin/login/input/output error

X respawning too fast:disabled for 5 minutes

No more processes left in this runlevel

Then it stays without showing any signs of life for five minutes,when it repeats the messages again:

init:id"x" respawining too fast:disabled for 5 minutes

I tried to reinstall it on my usb drive but nothing happens. how can i boot it?
