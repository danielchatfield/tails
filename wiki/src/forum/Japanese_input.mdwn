As of 0.13 Tails offers very limited support for Japanese. I know that 0.14 will become with Anthy, but until it comes out I was wondering if there's a way to mitigate this problem. 

If I want to send an e-mail (can Tormail handle non-alphabetic input?) in Japanese, would it be possible for me to type my message into an openoffice document using Anthy, copy that file into a USB thumb drive and copy paste it into Tails? Would this lead to Tails or Tormail leaking my IP information in any way?
