usually i start tails with the option "toram". so i can insert an empty media and burn it. but that only works with XFBurn when i download it. brasero doesnt reconize any media. i guess i have to mount it or something.

can anyone explain to me how to use brasero, id really like to use it instead of apt-get XFBurn...

thanks!
