I am planning on making a YouTube video about privacy and will show in it how to download tails and burn it to a DVD of thumb drive. I am not an expert by any means but I like this idea. I as yet have not felt the need to surf anonymously but that day may come. I am sure in some countires it is needed. I will post a link when I get the video done.
