@3: `curl` is also included in Tails and I successfully executed the first script in the second \"comment 1\".

It seemed quite efficient but I have no idea whether or not it could leak any compromising info.

I would appreciate if a Tails dev could clarify this, and whether or not is necessary or even desirable to add the `--socks5-hostname \"127.0.0.1:9050\"` part, as found in the *second* script in the aforementioned post.
