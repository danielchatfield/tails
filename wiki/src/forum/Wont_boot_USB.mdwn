Hi

Installed latest version Tails on two different USB sticks and tried to boot it on my Laptop which is new, after the initial boot screen for Tails shows up, i select English and it goes to mainly black screen with debian 6. something writtin in bottom corner and a white/blue/cyan progress along the bottom of screen.

Now the progress bars starts off by moving along for about 30sec to a minute and then stops. I have left this running now twice for over 30minutes and no chance. Tried different USB ports including a USB3 port, two different sticks one being a crucial stick i recently bought. Reinstalled and downloaded 3-4 times now.

Still never get past the white/blue/cyan progress bar?

Appreciate help guys
