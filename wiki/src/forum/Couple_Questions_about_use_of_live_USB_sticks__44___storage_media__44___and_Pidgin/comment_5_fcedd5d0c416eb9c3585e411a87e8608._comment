1) Is there any way of making a USB stick read-only, or are there specialised USB sticks that are read-only?

Yes. Here:

2) Are write-only CDs the safer option than a read-only USB stick, in the hypothetical situation that there was a software issue causing Tails to write to the boot media?

I sure think so. 

3) Should I be worried about the aforementioned results of the anonymity test? How does it compare to others?

If you like worrying. You're referring to JonDo's site, and remember they are selling a product. It's a little extreme to worry about getting a \"good\" rating on all points.Mouse over the categories on their \"report\" and reconfigure Firefox via the about:config command and you can improve most of those ratings.And use Tor.

4) In the hypothetical situation that a security issue caused Tails to write to the HDD, would there be a way of physically disconnecting the HDD of a laptop, or using the BIOS render it read-only, without it being extremely time-consuming to return it to its original state? I like to use Windows for gaming, and it would be pretty annoying having to take apart my laptop every time I wanted to play Skyrim ;)


Man.....I wish I knew.I will say this. If you don't access your HD when you use Tails, I don't think you are \"mounting\" your HD, which (I think) makes it as if it wasn't there re: exterior threats. So just don't click on the bloody thing, use USB or SDHC for storage etc instead. :)



Good Luck!   :)
