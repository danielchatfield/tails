Many thanks guys. I think I'll set up my system using a CD-R and use it with a seperate computer with the HDD detached I'm sure a friend has an old junk computer lying around, doesn't need to be particularly fancy. It's probably over-the-top and slightly unnecessary, but otherwise I'd just be worrying about 'what-if's all the time :P

Thanks so much, to everyone who helped out uin this thread, and everyone in the Tails development team, you're all doing a great job. You've all converted me to Linux (although I must admit I'm going to keep using Windows 7 on a partition so I can play games!) Slowly learning all the technical stuff, once I get good at programming etc, I'll do my best to help out with the development :)
