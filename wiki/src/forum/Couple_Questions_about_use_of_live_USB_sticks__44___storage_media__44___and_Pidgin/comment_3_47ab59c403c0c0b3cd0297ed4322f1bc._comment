Thanks for the replies guys, much appreciated. I have a few follow-up questions, just to clarify.

1) Is there any way of making a USB stick read-only, or are there specialised USB sticks that are read-only?

2) Are write-only CDs the safer option than a read-only USB stick, in the hypothetical situation that there was a software issue causing Tails to write to the boot media?

3) Should I be worried about the aforementioned results of the anonymity test? How does it compare to others?

4) In the hypothetical situation that a security issue caused Tails to write to the HDD, would there be a way of physically disconnecting the HDD of a laptop, or using the BIOS render it read-only, without it being extremely time-consuming to return it to its original state? I like to use Windows for gaming, and it would be pretty annoying having to take apart my laptop every time I wanted to play Skyrim ;)

p.s. Tails, thanks for the info about getting onto Pidgin, works fine now, much appreciated :)
