I use a usb sd card which has a read only tab on it. If your dealing with information which is ultra sensitive I would simply remove the hard disk (and probably physically remove other wireless ports, microphone ect, anything which could leak information + buy the highest grade tempest computer. Some ppl might tell you its software secure, but hey when a hard drive doen't exist, that's security I can see
