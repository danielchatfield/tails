@1:

An approximate of 3000 is a ridiculously small number of nodes for anonymity  purposes. One medium size company could have as much number of distributed network nodes on its own. Monitoring said network can be done blindfolded by a resourceful adversary.

And yeah, I ironically agree with you with the emphasis that the Tor network is 2500 years backward in strategy having such a size; yet it comes with inflated 'top notch anonymity' claims, and so are all the projects that are Tor dependent.
