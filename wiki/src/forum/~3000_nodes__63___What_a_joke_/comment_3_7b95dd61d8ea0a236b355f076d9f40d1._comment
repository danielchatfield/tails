>And yeah, I ironically agree with you with the emphasis that the Tor network is 2500 years backward in strategy

You despise Chinese military strategies but did you know China's economy is now the second largest in the world thanks in part due to her application of some of the 2500-year old strategies.

While many countries in the Middle East succumbed to the Arab Spring, China manages to stave off a similar uprising thanks also to the 2500-year old strategies.

With an army of 50 thousand strong internet brigade, China is able to censor or block unsavory posts of about 2 million every day.

China is now able to block her people from accessing Tor from within the country. Very soon her software programmers and hackers will be able to break Tails or Tor's anonymity.
