Hello   :)

I am having a problem getting HTTrack to save websites through Tor

I change the proxy server settings in the HTTrack program to 127.0.0.1 and port 9051 because I see the Tor software is using this port. Maybe I make mistake I don't know. Maybe it is a different port?

I have forum thread here

http://forum.httrack.com/readmsg/29372/index.html

Help is appreciated :) 

Thank you
