> If there was a website downloader program in Tails it would be a very nice feature.

httrack is part of Debian, so technically, you can install it in Tails. No idea which nice ways it may have to break your anonymity, though. I agree this would be a welcome feature. I'm not sure we'll put time into auditing httrack vs. Tor + anonymity any time soon. Help is welcome!

I think this falls into the \"persistent user data store\" usecase, doesn't it?
