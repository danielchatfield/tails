>I think this falls into the \"persistent user data store\" usecase, doesn't it?

Ok, maybe not a persistence feature, because if the program installed default on Tails it has a shortcut to Mirrored Websites.

So here are my experiences. It creates 4 shortcuts. One to open the program, one to browse the mirrored websites. The other two are duplicates.

The usage is based on browser. It tries to connect amnesia:8080 so it cannot. Changing it to localhost:8080 works. The options are at the page where you enter the website links. You must enter the options and set the proxy to 127.0.0.1 with port 8118

Each time you open it, the port number goes 1 up: 8081, 8082, 8083...

The settings, so the proxy settings are not saved. You must enter it each time. Maybe it can be edited?

Is there any need to add some filters here?

    +*.png +*.gif +*.jpg +*.css +*.js -ad.doubleclick.net/*

In my opinion, the program must download minimum number of files, should we add some filters from Adblock Plus, Ghostery, etc. to block some known unnecessary trackers/scripts. Also the user agent, cookie settings.. should be edited?

I can go no further cause I'm not a security expert, this should be added as todo so people could help?
