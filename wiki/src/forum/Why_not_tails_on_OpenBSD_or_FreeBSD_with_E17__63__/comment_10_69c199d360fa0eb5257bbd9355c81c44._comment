Bsd system depends PBI port software installation this are design to port Linux software to work on BSD FreeBsd PC-Bsd OpenBsd NetBsd are Unix Like \"not Linux\" then the security of the system depends on User Configuration and Use. so it's no unsafe Linux or Safe BSD they are different OS.
About Virus or Mal ware. they are software created to damage others systems people for competition issues \"business\" ( See Microsoft Apple Saga ) and not never forget Criminals who use this software code to still or clone data to commit crime. so it's only about victim pool to those people target Unix/Linux.
Then about Desktop BSD use KDE and offer compatibility for others environments with limited performance Gnome include.
If you are developer you are need to develop for the whole Gnu/Linux/Unix community then the center of this activities are the \"Linux Kernel\" only free base to make whole thing works.
Saying that if you are newbie you are in the right choice to embrace PC-BSD 9 or the latest 9.1 because this environment are more restricted to changes or user mistakes like Osx or infamous Windows 7 / 8 that is the maximum target for criminals.
Why Gnome are the center of the desktop choice? it's because the age of experience and easy to comprehend code design like \"Linux Kernel\" is a universal to whole community. Note the Ubuntu distribution use its own desktop Unity like Microsoft Metro, and Red Hat, Solaris uses its own Desktop based on Gnome2 code, May personal choose its PC-BSD 9 with Gnome 2 since 2 years at now. and not say i am a newbie, in fact i try 7 distributions 5 on Linux world and OSX/Windows. for years and the experience bugs and others Hi End Hardware compatibilities. goes me to adopt the best for my personal needs.
So i hope help you and others to clarify always think in your needs and capabilities to choose the right for you.
And i am a NASA Engineer with 32 years of experience.
