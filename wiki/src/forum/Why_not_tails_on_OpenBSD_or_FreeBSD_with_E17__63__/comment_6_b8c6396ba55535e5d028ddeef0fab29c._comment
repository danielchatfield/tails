Thank that was a really helpful answer #3 :) I did some reserch and I will go with FreeBSD like you said. I didn't know it had such good documentation for newbies like me. Thanks! :) Oh and I think the 2 gay dudes (4 & 5) are trying to pick a fight with you :) Becareful with them if you get too close to them 3 letters will take you to your final resting place lol. Do what I do just ignore the dumb people... :) Thanks again number 3! :)
