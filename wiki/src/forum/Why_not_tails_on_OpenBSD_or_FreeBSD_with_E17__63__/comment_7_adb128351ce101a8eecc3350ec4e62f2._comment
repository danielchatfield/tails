Number 6 I just read this question and I would use PC-BSD. It be easier and it more stable, with more usability and compatibility than Tails without all the issues you see in this forum...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4q-Y-byTl8 Check that out those guys know what they are taking about...You will not go wrong with any BSD anyway. :) Good luck to you!
