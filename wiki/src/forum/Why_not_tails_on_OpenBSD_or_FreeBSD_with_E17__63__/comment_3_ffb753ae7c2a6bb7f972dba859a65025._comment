Answer 1 Maybe you need to look at this http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/kFreeBSD and not give dumb answers? Tahe...I think he was asking if debian is with FreeBSD why not make Tails more secure by doing the SAME THING Debian is doing! Answer 2 Qubes lol really? More secure than FreeBSD or OpenBSD? lol To answer your question why Taiks does not use OpenBSD or FreeBSD with LXDE, XFCE or E17 is simple Tails has from a friendship with Debian and its another testing source for Debian like Ubuntu, Mint, Zorin and so on...With projects like Tails where friendships are more important than the task itself \"security\" you are not going to get quality. Is like using a product or a service from a company that hires people not because they are qualify or good but because they are just friends. If you want better than Tails and wish to stay with linux use Fedora (check this link--- http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major ) \"Fedora Pros: Highly innovative; outstanding security features...\" Or if you do not care to stay with linux use OpenBSD or FreeBSD with Firefox with the same addons Tails uses on Firefox with the browser's settings on constant private browsing with AnonimoX 1.0 and you do not need tails at all. And when installing Fedora, OpenBSD or FreeBSD do it with an Emcrypt installation. And stick with \"Independent\" distros not with those who are base on another distro...Like Qubes that is base on Fedora! But if I were you I would use FreeBSD it is ast and stable; availability of over 21,000 software applications (or \"ports\") for installation; very good documentation and no dependencies issues like linux. Hope that helps...:)
