As you spend so much of your time trolling around this forum, could you invest a tiny bit of effort into introducing a modicum of challenge to the game?

Some tips:

* Resist your compulsion to misuse the words \"dumb\" and \"gay\" - in *some* of your posts at least.
* Your keyboard has a key called \"return\" or \"enter\" - try it!
* You have the writing style of an infant. Try writing some of your posts as you think your teacher would word them.
* Try to resist your compulsion to constantly congratulate yourself for your previous (patently moronic) posts. You probably think they affirm your message but in fact they just make it far too obvious you're talking to yourself.

There's much more of course but that'll do for now. I don't want to overload you in one go. Perhaps for homework you'd like to look through your posts and identify some more of your tells for yourself?
