When I first installed tails on my USB with PenDrive I was still able to read and write on it from windows. After using the tails installer I can no longer do this as it only reads it on tails now. I only installed it with the official installer to be able to use persistence.

sorry if this is an easy fix or the way its supposed to work but I'm new to linux :)
