First, around 1-2 hours ago, and then again just now, I have encountered a bizarre experience while running Tails 0.16.

All of a sudden, a whole bunch of web sites become unreachable; get the generic "Unable to connect to..." message from Iceweasel. I'm talking like well over half of the sites I try-- sites that had been perfectly reachable and functional even mere seconds before.

Clicking "New Identity" in TorButton seems to solve the problem, so it would appear to be due to one or more nodes.

Perhaps instructive: news.google.com, remained reachable, and would display in what appeared to be Russian or another Slavic language. So that may provide a clue as to which node(s) are the culprit here.

Anyone else experience anything similar?
