After getting the Boot error, try Ctrl-Alt-F7 to continue booting.

This worked for me, however, I had a plop boot manager CD in the system at the time and selected USB to get it to boot - i.e. my system is a circa 2005 P4 Intel MB system and I always need to have a CD in the system to boot from a USB.
