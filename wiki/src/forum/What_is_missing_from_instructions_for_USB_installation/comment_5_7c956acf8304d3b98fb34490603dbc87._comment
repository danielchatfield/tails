Thanks for proposing improvements to the documentation.

There are some bits I didn't get from what you've written. You are talking about the page \"Installing onto a USB Stick\" but you NB2 says that this is only required for the option \"Upgrade from ISO\" which is not documented in the page since it has a separate page [[here|/doc/first_steps/usb_upgrade]].

Could you tell me in which use case the current instruction fails to install properly?
