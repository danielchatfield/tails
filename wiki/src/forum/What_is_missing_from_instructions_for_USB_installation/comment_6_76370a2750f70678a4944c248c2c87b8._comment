I previously dd'd tails-i386-0.11.iso to an unformatted USB and it subsequently booted properly with the plopbootmgr which had been burned onto a CD-RW with cdrecord.

When I tried to use the 0.11 tails USB to create an upgraded version of 0.12 to another USB it failed with several warnings:

Warning: The MBR on your device does not match your system's syslinux MBR.  If you have trouble booting this stick, try running the liveusb-creator --reset-mbr option
Unknown filesystem: Your device may need to be reformatted  (To what format???)

and subsequently, trying to use the tails-i386-0.12.iso on the TAILS 0.11 Desktop:
i.e tails-i386-0.12.iso selected on /home/amnesia/Desktop

The Master Boot Record on your device is blank.  Pressing  \"Create Live USB' again will reset the MBR on this device
Resetting Master Boot Record of /dev/sdx (where x was identified with Disk Utility)
<Press Create Live USB>
Unknown filesystem: Your device may need to be reformatted
Unsupported filesystem: Ext4

Repeat Warning msg above...

Note: The warning relates to the already booted TAILS 0.11 which was created via dd if=tails-i386-0.11.iso of=/dev/sdx (where x was identified with Disk Utility)

Finally, I figured out that setting the format on the to be burned USB for 0.12 to FAT, setting the bootable flag, and insuring that an MBR was formatted (all via Disk Utility) allowed the use of the the tails-i386-0.12.iso file in ~amnesia/Desktop to use the USB Installer with the ISO option successfully from the booted tails-i386-0.11.iso (albeit with an unformatted USB via dd command).
