If you followed this thread carefully, in order to get a bootable partition on  your USB stick - do the following:

From a successfully booted 0.11 or 0.12 TAILS or any Linux Live CD, DVD or USB with System>Administration>Disk Utility:

1. Run Disk Utility with the USB plugged in to which you want to burn the latest Tails ISO file, and select it from the left-hand-side of the Disk Utility window.  Starting from the top part of Disk Utility format the USB to have a Master Boot Record (MBR), and then from the bottom part of Disk Utility select format a partition, select FAT as the format, and check the bootable box to mart the partition as bootable.  Don't forget to identify the /dev/sdx device name and name the partition as /dev/sdx1 where x is an alpha character that identifies the USB port name where the to be burned USB stick is plugged in for your system.

Note: This should cure the \"no bootable partition found\" problem.

2. If you have downloaded the latest Tails ISO file and assuming it is located on your Desktop, the proceed to run the USB installer from the Applications>Tails selection box - and then select the 3rd method to use the Tails ISO file on your Desktop.

3. After the Tails ISO file is burned and verified, then shutdown your system and boot from the newly burned USB stick.
