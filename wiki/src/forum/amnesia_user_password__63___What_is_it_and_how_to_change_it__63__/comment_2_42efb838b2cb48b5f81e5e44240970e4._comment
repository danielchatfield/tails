The previous post by me (Tails) is confused. I got fooled by some incorrect assumtions in the OP's question:

> To use sudo, I use the password I created on boot, but I want the amnesia account to have a password, too.

The password you set in Tails greeter *is* the password for the `amnesia` user. When a password is set, the `amnesia` user is also allowed to issue any command via `sudo` using its password (this is how `sudo` is designed). The `root` user's password is always completely disabled in Tails (unless you set it via `rootpw=...` on the kernel cmdline, but that is for debugging purposes only as it is *complete insecure*).

So, what is it that you really want to achieve?
