Guys, everyone, in the comments section, writes that he has checked this or that addon through wireshark and found that to be completely safe and there was no packet leakage without proxy settings.

Every non-developer will be grateful to you forever if you kind explain (with video or image tutorial) how we can check whether a particular addon is leaking our privacy and bypassing anonymity.,

I could not find any tutorial on google and youtube. Kindly teach us the method once and for all keeping in view the security of all the Tails Users.

With Regards,
G.Rodrigues.
