>Moreover, anal penetration is not unique to gay men; it's found among heterosexuals as well.

>Nevertheless, anal penetration continues to play the central sexual role in gay male sexual life, with most gay men believing that an encounter which does not culminate in anal is deficient or lacking; and that true intimacy between men can only be achieved through the penetration of one partner by the other.

>Thus the act is incessantly romanticized, elevated above all others, and marketed: presented as the highest and truest form of gay \"sex,\" anal is discussed endlessly in newspaper and magazine articles, both in print and online; in sex manuals and other self-help books; and in low-, middle-, and high-brow gay male art, including novels, plays, television shows, legitimate cinema, and autobiography; and it is omnipresent, usually in sanitized and often romanticized form, in gay male graphic arts such as painting, in video pornography, and in literally millions of jpeg, gif, and bitmap images now available on the world wide web.

>In addition, anal penetration is pushed incessantly by AIDS Service Organizations, other \"Non-Governmental Organizations,\" and by their safer-sex educators through the social marketing of condoms -- known as \"condom campaigns\" -- which instruct MSM to \"Use a condom every time, every time,\" they have sex, and which cost donors and taxpayers literally tens of millions of dollars per year.

>And women overwhelmingly choose vaginal intercourse.

>Even though there's a great risk of pregnancy, which, given that most heterosex is not reproductive in intent, most women want to avoid most of the time they're having sex.

>Women nevertheless choose genital sex -- because it feels great, wonderful, ecstatic, blissful -- rather than anal penetration -- which is degrading and painful.

>When heterosexual couples do anal, it's virtually always at the urging of the male partner, and that urging is *cultural* in origin.

>For example, UCSF epidemiologist Daniel Halperin, in his study of anal transmission of HIV among heterosexuals, which is most common in Latin America and the Caribbean, notes that in some Latin cultures, it's said that a man has not truly had a woman until he's penetrated her three ways: vaginally, orally, and anally.

>This is about dominance, control, power, subjugation, and degradation.

>It's an act which at its core is sadistic.

>Indeed, studies of serodiscordant /heteroseuxal/ couples, in which the man is HIV+ and the woman HIV negative, have demonstrated that a woman is 10 to 20 times more likely to seroconvert -- that is, acquire HIV -- through anal penetration than she is through vaginal intercourse. [40]

>Which means that in terms of disease, and compared to vaginal or any other form of sex, anal penetration is uniquely dangerous. [39]
