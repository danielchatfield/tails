Are you're planning to stick something up your arse in order to carry Tails through two airports and from some sort of Fascist realm in which it's presumably illegal and impossible to obtain a copy, into another such dictatorship? If so it might be wise to avoid triggering any airport detectors - so the medium with the smallest possible metallic area would probably be the best choice?

Might be a good idea to find somewhere with similar security screening and use it to test various blank media before risking the Tails run. Perhaps visit some gov. building while carrying a candidate medium in your shirt pocket and see if you get your tit felt?
