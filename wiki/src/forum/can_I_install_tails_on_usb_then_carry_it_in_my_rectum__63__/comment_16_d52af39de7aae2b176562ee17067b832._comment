>i wonder if its portable enough to install tails on usb then slide it into my anus for carrying in my rectum through long road trips and travel flights?

I once slipped an orange into my anus. It's surprising what you can shove up there. I'm sure you could manage a USB stick. As mentioned previously **DON'T FORGET TO BAG IT** first. You wouldn't want to catch one of those nasty worms or viruses going around.
