>>why rectum?

>it feels good and it's more covert than other methods

It seems many of the previous respondents may have failed to grasp the full timbre of this delicate enquiry.

I too used to carry sensitive code on a nice curvaceous thumbdrive inserted into my rectum. One must, of course, insert it into a condom and knot the end before performing the technophilic autosodomy. Thus one may avoid buggering ones device, rather than the desired converse.

Alas, you'll find that the sensation quickly fades and you'll soon be drawn to altogether more grand equipment. These days I carry my data on a 3.5\" HDD mounted in a waterproof enclosure. I derive immense gratification from both having two full terabytes of encrypted storage about my person at all times, and from the means by which I achieve this.
