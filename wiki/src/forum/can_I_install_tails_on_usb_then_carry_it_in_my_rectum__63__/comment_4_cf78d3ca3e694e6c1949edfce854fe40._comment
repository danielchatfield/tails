Ok, I take the chance of being troll napped, but I give it a go :D

Why on Earth would you carry it inside your rectum? There are a zillion ways to get Tails over the internet. On your destination you must have internet or Tails will be useless for you.

You can also store tails on - say - a microSD card and use an usb card reader to boot up your pc (to Tails). Why not store a tails image file on your smartphone, an usb watch, an usb writing pen, a kids toy, a camera...

AFAIK microSD is the tiniest storage card available. If you buy at least a 4 Gigabyte card you have plenty of space for tails + plenty of data. It's small enough for your need (I suppose, never tried it...)
