>Your colon makes a sharp bend to the left, approximately eight inches up. A penis can bang against this turn and you might notice a sharp pain in the pit of your stomach. It usually won't push through. *A hard toy can push through and when it does, you are in a life and death situation.* You feel intense pain and must get right to a hospital. Delay and the bacteria can spread throughout your abdomen. This type of infection (peritonitis) can take your life.

>And the use of \"personal lubricants,\" a necessity during anal penetration, means that afterwards these leak through the anal sphincter, carrying with them fecal matter.

>Moreover, over time, the anal sphincter stretches, and leakage of rectal secretions and other fluids from the ano-rectal area is the result. [53]

>The Man2Man Alliance is a coalition of Men -- some of whom self-identify as \"gay,\" others as \"straight,\" and others as \"bi\" -- but most of whom today have rejected those out-dated labels and now simply identify as Men -- Men who are determined to win recognition from society of the genuineness of their feelings for one another; and of the validity of the expression of that affection through Frot, phallus-on-phallus sex, which is not only life-affirming and masculine but mindful of both participants' shared and mutual enjoyment.
.......
>In summary:

>1. Phallus-to-Phallus Sex, in the past commonly called \"frottage,\" and today most often termed \"Frot,\" is an inherently equal, natural, and masculine form of genital-to-genital sexual expression.

>2. Anal penetration, which at present is extolled by the mainstream gay male community, is by contrast inherently unequal, unnatural, and effeminizing, and is a vector for a host of physical ills, including some which are among the most terrifying known to humankind.
