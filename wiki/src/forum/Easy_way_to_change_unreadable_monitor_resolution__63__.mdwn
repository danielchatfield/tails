When I start Tails 0.11 it sets a very high monitor resolution on a high end computer.

Very hard for me to read the greeter, same when I try to change the resolution to - say - 1024 x 768 in the preferences menu. Changing the resolution does work in the end.

Is there an easy way to pre set my favorite resolution?
