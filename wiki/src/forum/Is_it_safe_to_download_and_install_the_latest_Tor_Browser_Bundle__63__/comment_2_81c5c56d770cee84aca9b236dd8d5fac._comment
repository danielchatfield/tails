I'd like to add that I had also tried running TBB from a number of number of other live GNU/Linux distros and it only worked with one of them (can't recall which). 

And at least two of these were the same distros that I had no problem running TBB from *installations* of. So it seems that there is some incompatibility between TBB and live environments. (or at least *was*; I have not tried running TBB from a live environment for some time)
