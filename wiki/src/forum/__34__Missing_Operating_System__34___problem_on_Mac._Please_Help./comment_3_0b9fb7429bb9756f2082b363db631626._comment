on linux if the filesystem is vfat you can use isolinux. If it's ext then syslinux works. The only difference is the filesystem that's supported.

personally I have my usb formatted to ext. vfat is more standard though.

you should use the fs that's supported by your aplication (the one that's equivalent to syslinux). Read up on it... sorry but I have no more info for you. 

If not look for alternatives and try them out.
