Thanks for bringing up this topic.

Do you think that adding the following to the current documentation would correct that mistake:

<em>This technique also works for SD cards. Some SD cards have a read-only switch that can prevent your Tails from being altered. **But be aware that this protection is most probably not ensured by the SD card itself. Do not rely on untrusted computers to respect this feature.**</em>
