Install a second router.
 Have that router run your VPN settings, Linksys if i recall was able to connect to a VPN.
Have your TAILS HOST connect to the second router. 
Your MIND ((( VPN ))) TAILS (TOR) (((VPN)))) --- TAILS (TOR) -> HTTP/SOCKS/IRC 

Concept also applies to a HOST/Guest VM setup.
 Host pc runs the vpn while the guest is Tails.
