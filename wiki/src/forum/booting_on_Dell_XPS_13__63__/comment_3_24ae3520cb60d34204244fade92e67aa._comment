Thanks TAILS,

I checked the \"doesn't start\" info before - was hoping that SOMEONE had an idea of how to fudge the bootloader/etc to make it work with these DELL units (going to be a problem more and more I'll bet).

Good old crufty non-standard hacks.  I know the dangers.  Just that Linux is not my flavor of *nix

I'll file a bug, but it won't fix the issue. 

It does boot from DVD, so I might break ALL the rules and simply kludge up a full disk install.

I bought this machine specifically for Tor/TAILS.

My other choice is to load Ubuntu 12.04LTS or 12.10 and hope I can \"fix\" all the leaks to make it work properly with Tor (aka like TAILS)
