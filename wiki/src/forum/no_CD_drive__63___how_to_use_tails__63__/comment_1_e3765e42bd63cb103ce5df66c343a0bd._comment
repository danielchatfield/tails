USB stick also is not possible!

I have really big hard disk on my computer but nothing else.

I generally start live systems directly from the hard disk using a «test entry» in menu.lst from grub:

[quote]
title 		Test
rootnoverify 	(hd0,nn) 
kernel	 	/test/vmlinuz pmedia=atahd psubdir=test
initrd 		/test/initrd.img
[/quote]

where nn is my partition where the files from the iso are in /sdann/test.

I can so start for example the setup CD-ISO from Debian and it goes.
