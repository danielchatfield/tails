>> If that's the adversary's goal, they can probably achieve it somehow.

What if an adversary with root access wants to set a backdoor for future access. From what I gather this often (always?) involves the opening of one or more ports. Would this action compromise the user's anonymity? That is, even if finding out the user's real IP isn't the adversary's goal, would the process of setting up a backdoor mess up iptables?
