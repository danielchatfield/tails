Thanks for the prompt reply!

Final newbie question: 
a)I've read several Debian security advisories pertaining to iceweasel and it usually says something like \"might allow for arbitrary code execution\". With what permissions? In the case of a Tails user with a fairly lengthy/strong password. Also, assuming said user is not running as root.
b)assuming an attacker has regular user access. Would (in broad terms) a privilege escalation attack meant for the Android OS work in Tails? I'm asking because Android is based on the Linux kernel.
