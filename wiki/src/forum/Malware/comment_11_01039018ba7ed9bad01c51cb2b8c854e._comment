Whonix sounds interesting, but you should know that simply running Tails or another OS inside a virtual machine (VM) is no guarantee of security.  Virtual Machines are also subject to serious security vulnerabilities which can be hard to find and fix, so simply introducing a VM may only increase the height of your attack profile.
