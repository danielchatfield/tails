I think running Tails from a Virtual machine is really the only way to go. I mean, what if you're the target of a zero-day attack?

I tried running Tails on Virtual Box, but in the 'create virtual HDD' section of the Wizard it says that you need at least 8 GB. Should I just set the size to 0? Also, when it asks me to ask which distro I'm using should I choose 'Debian' or 'Other'? Finally, should I configure my internet connection on the host OS and turn it on whenever I want to browse the internet, or should I do that in Tails, like when I'm running from the Live CD(I'm using DSL, so I have to configure it manually at boot time).
