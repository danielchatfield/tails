It might(?) depend on the router type but malware could query your router to return your external IP address.  There are utilities to do this. I am hoping the specific protocol that can do it are blocked in Tails.  

The good news: Linux in general is still far less affected by viruses and trojans than Win or Mac. In nine years of linux use I have never had a single virus than I know of.  

My guess is that the biggest threat to anonymity on Tails (and indeed elsewhere) are probably: 

1. Social engineering attacks which trick the user into revealing their identity or installing a trojan/malware which then either breaks firewall rules or queries your router to determine your ext IP address.

2. Browser fingerprinting attacks.  

3. Attacks on the tor network such as a malicious site that takes advantage of a browser vulnerability to circumvent tor or end-to-end timing attacks.
