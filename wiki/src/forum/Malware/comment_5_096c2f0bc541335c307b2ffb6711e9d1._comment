I feel that a broad background in privacy and surveillance issues generally is prerequisite for anyone who wants to try to use Tor \"safely\".  Providing such background inevitably involves discussing legal and political issues as well as technological points.

I mostly agree with the preceding post, but I think Tor users everywhere should also be cognizant of a threat which until recently went largely unrecognized by the privacy community: malware attacks, even APT (advanced persistent threat) attacks, by intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies worldwide which are acting under the presumption that (to paraphrase the way one Russian official recently put it) \"99% of Tor users are engaged in serious criminal activity\".

We here know that this is an absurdly mistaken presumption, but given the international boundary-crossing nature of Tor circuits, you can see how under this false presumption, Tor users are subject to attention from the intelligence and law enforement agencies of

* the nations where most Tor nodes are located (USA, UK, Germany, Netherlands were among the top ten last time I checked)

* certain nations through which most internet traffic with an endpoint in certain regions flows; for example, if you live in Latin America, there is a good chance that most of your traffic funnels through Miami; if you live in South Asia, through Mumbai; if you live in Africa, all your traffic is likely to traverse the USA; these statements apply even to data streams whose starting and ending points both lie within the same region, even the same African city

* the intelligence agencies of certain \"global players\", nations which attempt to access any data stream anywhere in the world; the \"Five Eyes\" (USA, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada) share interceptions snagged by the NSA's vastly ambitious (and vastly expensive) global collection programs with each other and with EU agencies such as German and Swiss agencies, sometimes even with Russian and Asian agencies; everyone should know that the NSA operates a global interception network which in the past decade has been greatly retooled to focus on fiber-optic cables; the NSA operates a submarine specially kitted out to tap into undersea cables, and its Special Collection Service (SCS) regularly deploys agents who can secretly tap into buried cables in non-US territories; its data snarfing operations appear to snag a large fraction of the worlds voice communications, text messages, emails, websurfing, as well as faxes and other kinds of file transfers, including personal financial transactions and medical records

These adversaries are of course in addition to the police and intelligence agencies of your country of residence.

It doesn't matter that most of us are very far from being criminals or espionage agents; what matters is that these agencies view us all as eternal suspects in the global fight to preserve whatever the haves have.

These intelligence agencies know very well that the presumption of universal guilt is absurdly incorrect, but for the purpose of extending their budgets and political power they are all attempting to redefine political and social activism as \"potential criminal activity\" and \"potential terrorism activity\", so that they can more effectively protect the ruling classes from social chaos as the global depression worsens.

It has long been known that a US federal police agency with a global reach, the FBI, routinely employs malware including:

* CIPAV: provides the FBI with a \"weblog\" of urls visited plus other metadata from the targeted PC, laptop, or smartphone, see

> https://www.eff.org/foia/foia-endpoint-surveillance-tools-cipav

* Magic Lantern: a keylogger, so even more intrusive malware, typically installed via a phishing email sent to the victim

among others.  These malwares have been developed under contract for exclusive use by the FBI.  The data they collect from targeted devices (phone, laptop, PC, webmail server) is sent by a circuitous route to the FBI surveillance center in Sterling, VA (near its Quantico headquarters).  This facility also receives data furnished by high volume DPI (deep packet inspection) sniffers such as the DCS-1000 and DCS-5000, which are typically installed in facilities operated by major ISPs and Telecoms, or in \"carrier hotels\".  Ironically, the path taken by such data is said to include onion routers.

For example, it appears that Verizon operates at least two facilities which are entirely devoted to \"teeing\" the data streams of all Verizon customers to US government collection and processing facilities: a facility in Houston, TX is said to handle non-voice data streams, while another in Irving, TX handles voice communications.

There is much evidence that the FBI and similar agencies in the UK and EU have used these tools in addition to the usual miasma of paid informants and undercover police officers to target a wide variety of legal organizations, ranging unions through opponents of fracking or airport extensions.  See

> http://www.aclu.org/maps/spying-first-amendment-activity-state-state

for a list the ACLU compiled a few years ago of abuses inside the USA, and search for the recent \"Mark Kennedy\" scandal in the UK/EU.

Police and intelligence agencies in other nations often purchase malware which is functionally equivalent to CIPAV, Magic Lantern, and Talon from malware-as-a-service companies, most of which are located in the US, Germany, and Israel, but they have also appeared in India, South Africa, and other locales.

Last year the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) in Berlin revealed that they had captured and partially reverse engineered similar malware used by police agencies in several German states (some of which admitted that the CCC's allegations were correct).  After the disclosure that they had purchased commercial malware, these agencies resolved to follow the FBI model by designing in-house malware, and they are currently advertising for software developers who possess the requisite criminal skills.

In addition, anyone who has posted supporting the Syrian opposition (or Tibetan dissidents or...) is likely to come to the attention of smaller agencies which also believe they are locked in an existential global conflict; see

> https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/iinternet-back-in-syria-so-is-malware

Bloomberg News and other media outlets have extensively documented evidence that Syrian secret police has been using surveillance and electronic attack systems obtained from Western companies, although the companies involved mostly claim their \"products\" where diverted or stolen, some admit to at least a past relationship with the brutal Assad regime.  In an illustration of the global nature of the Syrian conflict, last year the FBI (how ironic!) arrested someone in the Washington area, who they claimed had been following and videotaping local activists allied with the Syrian opposition.

It is obvious why the Syrian secret police regard themselves as engaged in a civil war which is being carried out on a global scale, but never forget that the largest and most lethal \"intelligence agencies\" in the history of the planet are operated by nation which also regards itself as engaged in a global existential conflict, a \"war\" in which \"the enemy\" has never been precisely defined, but which in practice appears to have morphed from \"anyone who assists anyone who opposes any policies of the USA\" to \"any enemy of our current allies in our global war\".  This is a definition which obviously embraces the Tor community (notwithstanding the fact that the US secret police also use Tor).
