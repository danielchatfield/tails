Thanks, those are all good reasons too!

Unfortunately I apparently lack some requirements to use Tails with VirtualBox.  Any chance of some suggestions on how to use Tails for those who can download and burn Tails to a bootable DVD, and can then boot from the DVD, and can then use the installer to make a bootable USB stick (I presume),but then can't boot from that bootable USB stick?  This creates problems with persistence.  Any suggestions for how to safely transfer to/from Tails running on a laptop off the DVD things such as

* bridge descriptors (any use in helping with the Entry Guard problem?)
* IW json bookmarks
* sensitive files

If someone doesn't write a tutorial on what Tails users should know about USB sticks, I will try to write my own, which might be unintentionally misleading because there are some crucial points I don't think I understand sufficiently well yet.
