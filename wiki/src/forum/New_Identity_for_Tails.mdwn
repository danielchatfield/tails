From the warning page:
>The solution to both threats is to shutdown and restart Tails every time you're using a new identity, if you really want to isolate them better.

It would be nice if there was a "New Identity" option for "Tails". Or you can call it a "quick reset-restart"/"fresh start" option.

Whenever I want a fresh start, I will just click the button so instead of closing the computer it will clean the memory and will quickly start again. As a different option, it could also be useful for people who configures Tails using "Tab" at the beginning; it will start Tails using the previous settings. You can also implement this feature with persistence in the future, so we can quickly reset Tails using the same read-only persistent data.
