Are there any plans for a special version of Tails to be installed in virtual machine?

I understand, this is a security risk and violates "amnesic" features of Tails. However, if VM is located on a (Linux) computer with encrypted hard disk... and if this special version will allow to copy paste between host na VM and it will enable persistence of settings (for instance keyboard laayout) and installation of let's say Flash (with BetterPrivacy Firefox plugin) - that would make Tails more useful while not loosing too much security.

Coments?
