I have four questions about features in Tails. People who know about them please answer.

- How to disable 'recent documents' feature?

- How to stop and/or delete terminal command history?

- Is there 'Last visited URLs' log similar to the one in windows registry?

- Can Tails be made to use fake hardware identifiers, if so, how?

Thanks in advance!
