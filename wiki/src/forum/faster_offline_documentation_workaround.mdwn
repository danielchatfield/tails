Offline documentation is in some cases [[unusable|todo/faster_offline_documentation_browsing/]].

If we open the documentation directly in Iceweasel, we are redirected to check.torproject.org. 

The plan was: first open Iceweasel and then open the documentation in a new tab.

Unfortunatelly, I don't know enough about bash, so I paste here my search results, hoping somebody can succeed:

    #!/bin/bash
    iceweasel
    wait 5
    iceweasel --new-tab 'file:///usr/share/doc/tails/website/index.fr.html'


If this is not possible to fix this bug that way, is it possible to, at least, include a link to the offline documentation in Iceweasel's bookmarks? This could be a precious time-saver.

Hoping to browse confortably the documentation in Tails 0.12,

Greetings
