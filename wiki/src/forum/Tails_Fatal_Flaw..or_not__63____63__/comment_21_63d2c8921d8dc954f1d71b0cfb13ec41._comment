I once asked tails about a problem and got a polite answer. Reading these pages seems to confirm the politeness still exists. In addition the willingness to accept a correction once well clarified.
It strikes me Liberte is a bit like those people at the French Revolution who charged about killing the innocents with the guilty just because no one would stop them. Or maybe one of those women knitting at the foot of the guillotine waiting for the next head to roll.

You don't get a good reputation behaving like this and with reputation goes trust. Religious Zealots have ruined everything for everyone throughout history.

Just get together, agree on what's the best for the user's in both security and anonymity and remember the end product has to just work first time out of the box without us having to tweak.

Just look at Mint vs Ubuntu vs Gnome 3. One party keeps with the principle of making sure the user not only gets what he wants but that it works. The other 2 parties just decided that if they shout loud and long enough the people will just follow.

Look at Apple. They made stuff that the user wanted and it worked. It's simple really.

And in case someone wants to launch an attack on this I should point out I do not own anything Apple and my choice of Mint is solely based on .deb and it works. Ubuntu 6.0.6 was great with one wi-fi tweak which was at least one less than anyone else's at the time (sorry PCLinuxOS worked out of the box but was .rpm)

It sounds as if I've been teaching Unix/Linux since before at least one of you boys was born. 

Kiss, make-up and give us something even more outstanding.
