Indeed. If I recall correctly, a notable example of this *was* Mozilla Thunderbird/Icedove. Unless you set mail.smtpserver.default.hello_argument to something, Icedove would set the HELO/EHLO argument to the IP address of the NIC even if you had a SOCKS proxy set. I believe this was fixed sometime during the 3.x series.
