this is a very interesting thread. I had been looking at liberte too, and I see that the liberte website has not been modified with the information provided by the tails dev here(as was requested).

It seems to me that the author of the posts above (not the OP though) is actually the lead dev behind liberte from the similar language used and his in depth knowledge of the projects (not to mention the passion!!). While I find that it is good that he provides a list of other anonymity projects on his website I see it as a little dishonest that he does not update his site with regards to the information in this thread, specifically as tails is particularly singled out there in some negative light.

I really appreciate this little clash though, I hope it will go to make both distros better. I do hope that the competition or shared space can remain friendly and constructive though as both parties obviously have a lot to offer.

That said, liberte does have a few extra bells and whistles ;p
