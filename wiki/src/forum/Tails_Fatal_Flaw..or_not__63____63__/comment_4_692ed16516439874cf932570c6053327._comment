Thank you for bringing this to our attention. It for sure is sane to
confront the Tails design and implementation (and ourselves!) with
assertions of possible flaws.

Short version of the answer: the quoted text is sometimes wrong, often
exagerating a lot, and there's nothing that serious to worry about as
far as I understand it.

\"One of the most notable Liberté Linux design differences from PELD is
the issue of explicit vs. transparent proxying of network connections
of applications. In Tails, any application that creates a network
connection is transparently routed through Tor (including DNS
requests).\"

\"This approach to Torification of network activity is fundamentally
flawed [...]\" and later \"Liberté avoids this serious design flaw\"

> Using big, strong words such as *fundamentally flawed* and *serious
> design flaw* does not make wrong arguments right.

\"As a result, there is explicit reliance on the application not
inadvertently leaking this address to its communication peer due to
a bug, a wrongly implemented feature, or a design flaw.\"

\"In addition, many applications leak unnecessary DNS requests that,
too, are automatically routed through Tor in this approach.\"
