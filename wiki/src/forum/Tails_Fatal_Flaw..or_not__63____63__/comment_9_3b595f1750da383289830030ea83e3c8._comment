thanks tails for your answers.i started the original thread. i did download liberte and have been running it for a little while and i must say i much prefer tails....using the web sucks on liberte...the only good thing is the password at startup and persistance..nothing else...so if you get those in one day it would be fantastic...keep up the good work:)
