\"If I recall correctly, a notable example of this was Mozilla Thunderbird/Icedove.\"

Another troubling example was/is a bug in Opera that allows the response to a certain malformed request to bypass proxy settings altogether.  A warning should have been emblazoned in six-foot high letters across the Tor website since this allows an obvious anonymity compromise  (it was never even mentioned!).  This is a very old known bug that Opera simply ignored.  I am not sure if it has been fixed or not but I will never use Opera for anyway since this indicates a poor attitude to all security bugs in general.
