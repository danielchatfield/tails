I did not answer your question yesterday, at the same time I answered the others, because your question is more complicated that the others to answer seriously.

Also, we're preparing a point-release. Takes time. And nobody commited themselves to answer any questions the same day someone asks them, you know?

To end with, we're not part of any competition with Liberté Linux, and not trying to earn or keep \"market shares\". If you think Liberté is the right tool for you, I'm very happy to see you use it instead of Tails.

On the other hand, we indeed need to think about this set of statements propagated online, and answer it soon.
