How is allowing transparent proxyfication for applications, that should be otherwise using an explicit proxy, an additional level of protection? That's an additional potential security vulnerability, not protection. Sounds like a design flaw, unless you don't need transparent proxying, then why it's on? You didn't refute anything in that quote if you ask me.
