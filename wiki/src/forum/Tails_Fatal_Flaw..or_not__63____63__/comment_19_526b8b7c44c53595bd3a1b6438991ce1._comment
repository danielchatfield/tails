> Then again, Liberte appears to have a total absence of any support forum/list which is incredibly annoying, at least Tails devs are good enough to have this forum.

There is a new [support forum](https://forum.dee.su/) at present, and previously the forums at SourceForge were rather active, too.

> I also wonder at the annoying time-limited root access in Liberte which is a major pain in the ass for relatively skilled Linux users - does that really achieve anything?

I beg your pardon, a “skilled Linux user” who is unable to find SourceForge forums linked from the [main page](http://dee.su/liberte)?

> And Liberte's use of the Anonymous group's logo whilst (ironically?) disclaiming any association gives pause for thought.

Please, share your insight.
