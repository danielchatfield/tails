Several programs/plugins I use don't simply don't connect anymore since V 0.10. Like pidgin with msn/msn-pecan doesn't connect. And most web-chats (all bigger web-chats and all flash enhanced) simply say 'connection error'

All that stuff still works before V 0.10 and I wonder if the reasons for that errors could be stricter policies for the tor proxy. 

Could someone tell me if anything and what has been changed? Or maybe you could give me a hint me how I can check by myself. 

Thanks for TAILS
And Thanks for your help

Roger
