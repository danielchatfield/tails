Could someone please help to explain this behaviour. 


I have noticed this only with 0.16.

When tails is booted and java is disabled via iceweasel - preferences - content - enable java checkbox prior to connecting a network cable, noscript is disabled via the icon next to the url field. 

If i allow tails to boot with a network cabled attached and do not change the java settings, then Noscript is enabled by default. 

Why is there a difference and how does this occur ? 


Thanks in advance for anyone who puts in time to read and respond.
