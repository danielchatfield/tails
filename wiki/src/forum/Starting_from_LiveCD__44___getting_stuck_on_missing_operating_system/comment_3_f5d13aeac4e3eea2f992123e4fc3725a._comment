I also tried on a DVD, I get the same problem. Do need anything else than the tails.iso to burn the DVD. When I open the burned DVD i have isolinux and live folder, it seems ok. Checked the live folder and a large file (which I assume is the system) filesystem.squashfs is in there.

>/dev/disk0

0: GUID_partition_svheme 200GB disk0

1: EFI 209MB disk0s1

2: Apple_HFS Macintosh HD 179GB disk0s2

3: Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP 20.7GB disk0s3


>/dev/disk1

0: Apple_partition_scheme 807.1 MB disk1

1: Apple_partition_map 32.3 KB disk1s1

2: Apple_HFS TAILS 0.13 - 201 1 806.5 MB disk1s2

Still getting stuck. I hope this info is clear enough.
