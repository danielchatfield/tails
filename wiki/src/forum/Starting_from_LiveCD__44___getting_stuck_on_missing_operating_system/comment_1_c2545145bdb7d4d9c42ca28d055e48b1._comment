Someone else reported something very similar in the past few days.

Did you possibly try to burn a 850 MB iso image on a CD instead of a DVD?  Because it would be a little too large to fit on a CD, and while I haven't tried it, I suppose the result might be a CD which is readable but missing essential boot and OS files.
