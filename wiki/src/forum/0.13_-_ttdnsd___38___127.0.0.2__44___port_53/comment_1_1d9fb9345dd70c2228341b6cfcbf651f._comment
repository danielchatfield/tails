Tails runs three DNS servers (please see our [[docs|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/DNS]]): ttdnsd, pdnsd and Tor (via `DNSPort`). They cannot run on the same listen address and port combination, so we happened to pick 127.0.0.2 instead of 127.0.0.1 for ttdnsd (which is useful if you want to do arbitrary DNS queries like `host -t mx boum.org 127.0.0.2`). Note that 127.0.0.2 is part of the 127.0/8 prefix, i.e. it points to localhost.
