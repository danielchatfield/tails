I typically save content from the Internet using TAILS (w/Lice CD or USB):
Assuming you have saved an image, text file, or document on your TAILS Desktop:
1) Become root:
   $ sudo -i
2) Run following command to find the hard drive device name you want to mount
   # fdisk -l
3) Assuming your hard drive partition is /dev/sdbx, create a mount point directory
   # mkdir /mnt/sdbx
4) Mount the hard drive (assumes it is an ext3 file system of a Linux hard drive)
   # mount -v -t ext3 /dev/sdbx /mnt/sdbx
5) Change directory from ~amnesia/Desktop to save directory
   # pushd /mnt/sdbx/root/save
6) Save downloaded document on hard drive
   # mv ~amnesia/Desktop/ms.doc /mnt/sdbx/root/save
7) Pop the hard drive directory path
   # popd
8) Exit root account
   # exit
