Please see \"Why doesn't Tails ship software XYZ?\" section on [[contribute/faq]] for the long list of reasons why we might *not* add this or that download manager you like to Tails.

What needs to be done if you really want this in Tails:

* convince us the usecase covered by this software is not well supported in Tails yet
* see how it works with Tor / anonymity. Do we really want an additionnal HTTP client, that has a different network/HTTP fingerprint than the ones we already ship?
* check how much additionnal size it would add to the ISO
