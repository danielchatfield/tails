ok it depends on system performance how long the RAM cleaning takes. in my case it takes about 5 seconds if i reboot from tails to tails again. 
i have 8 GB DDR3 RAM and the rest of my system is also quite good.

how long should it take and where can i check if it's correctly done? 

thank you and good buy
