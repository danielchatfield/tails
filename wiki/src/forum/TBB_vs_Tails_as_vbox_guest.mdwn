the majority of use I get out of tails is from its anonymous web browsing capabilities (the other features such as wiping and securing files rarely get used).

I'm interested in the pros and cons of running tails in virtual box compared to just running the TBB natively. I'm not a political activist or anything, the main use will be anonymous browsing with an occasional comment.

any ideas?

I will give some more details - 

the tails vbox has no hardrive and its vbox folder is located on a dedicated encrypted file system. The ISO is also located on this encrypted filesystem.

the host is linux with encrypted storage but no full disk encryption or encryption of home directory.

TBB can be run also from the same dedicated encrypted filesystem but I'm not sure if there's much of a benefit for doing so.



I cannot decide which I prefer so I would appreciate any pros and cons to consider. The only difference so far appears to be the time it takes to load tails which is obviously much longer (though with hardware vt support it is very snappy once loaded). Also switching between the host and the guest is quite clunky compared to just switching windows over to the TBB in the linux host.

thank you for your opinions
