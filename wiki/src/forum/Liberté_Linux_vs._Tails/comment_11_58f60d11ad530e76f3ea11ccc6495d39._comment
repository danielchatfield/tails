I'm glad Tails moderators appear to have lightened their stance on liberte vs tails discussions. I believe that discussion about other programs (similar to Tails) is important in allowing the end user to decide if TAILS is the right mix. Ultimately when a decision is made it will be made with more confidence knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each. 

I have been asking this question for some time now, and for me the answer is i like them both. Find what you like in each. Thank you to all the hard working developers for giving us such good programs to choose from!
