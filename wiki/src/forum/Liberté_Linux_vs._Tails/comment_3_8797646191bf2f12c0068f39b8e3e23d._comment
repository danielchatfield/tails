My own Quick and Dirty comparison, based on personal experiences.

Operational differences between Tails 0.12.1 and Liberte Linux 2012.2

Emergency Exit

If you unplug the pendrive, the PC shuts down, after wiping RAM, within 30 seconds. Tails is slightly faster on my PC, and blacks out the screen faster (Liberte Linux shows it's logo for a short time). Emergency Exit mode might hang in some cases if you use a PLPBT iso (booting from a pendrive if your pc does not support usb booting).

Installation

Liberte Linux is easier to install on a pendrive. Unzip to pendrive, run [setup.bat], follow the instructions on the screen. Tails offer better security installing itself on a pendrive. For example if you install from a verified Tails live cd, viruses have hardly any chance.

Persistence

Liberte Linux offers broader persistence options, e.g. installing applications. Both use an encrypted container to store the sensitive data.

TrueCrypt

Tails is abandoning TrueCrypt, can be enabled with a startup parameter for now.

Root commands

You likely can not enter root commands by accident on Liberty Linux. You have to read the documentation. There is an awkward procedure to enable root access, or you must enter a boot startup parameter.

Document production

Tails has a more complete, thus slower, OpenOffice V3 suite..Liberte Linux offers a English spellchecker by default for it's Abiword V2.8.6 word processor. Tails has a \"metadata\" removal tool, Liberty Linux inserts generic metadata, backdates created documents (1969 iirc).

Cloaking / hiding

Tails looks more innocent. In default configuration Liberte Linux displays their logo, which might draw attention on a public pc. If you plug a Tails pendrive in a Windows computer, it does not display the individual files (you might get a \"do you want to format this drive\" message). If you lose your Tails pendrive, someone might just reformat it and use it afterwards. If someone finds a lost Liberte Linux pendrive, he might get curious.

Cables

Liberte Linux offers a serverless \"cables\" message system, which is basically a p2p message system on a Claws email GUI. Both sender and receiver need to \"see\" each other to exchange \"emails\". Initially can cost you half an hour before your Cables node is discoverable by the other party.

Mac Changer

Liberte Linux tries to perform a mac address change at startup.

Surfing

Tails uses Iceweasel, Liberte Linux uses Epiphany. Both perform well over the Tor network, both have script blocking, prefer HTTPS traffic. Tails opening website is \"check.torproject.org\", so you instantly know your Tor is working. Liberte Linux opens a menu website. Liberte Linux also has uGET download manager, and a gFTP client.

Email

Both use the claws client. Liberte Linux claws client is pre-configured with a \"cables\" account (on pendrive only!). Tails client installs \"empty\".

IM

Both use the Pidgin client, Tails comes pre-configured with an OFTC account over SSL and a nickserv. Liberty Linux Pidgin is \"empty\" by default.

Password Manager

Liberty Linux offers Figaro's Password Manager for password needs.

Different Languages

Liberte Linux can easy handle \"exotic languages\" e.g. Mongolian, Arabic.
