From [Liberté Linux FAQ](http://dee.su/liberte-faq):

**Q**: How does Liberté Linux differ from other anonymity distributions?

**A**: Liberté is a [specialized](http://dee.su/liberte-motivation) and lightweight live distribution with [deep system integration](http://dee.su/liberte-security) and [rapid development cycle](https://github.com/mkdesu); it is not a thin configuration wrapper for a major distribution. The focus is on adding innovative features, some of which require in-house research and development. A few of the capabilities that (to the best of my knowledge) were pioneered in Liberté Linux are:

* [Cables communication](http://dee.su/cables) for transparent and reliable anonymous email-like message exchange
* Immediate shutdown with anti-forensic memory erasure on boot media extraction
* Encrypted persistence of user data and settings on resizable [LUKS](http://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/)/[OTFE](http://www.freeotfe.org/) volume
* Initial clock setting from Tor consensus, entirely dropping the requirement for non-Tor communication (including DNS)
* Separate Unsafe Browser for registration in public Wi-Fi hotspots
I2P communication over Tor means better firewall traversal and no need to rely on another anonymity framework

The purpose of Liberté is not to popularize Tor or I2P with computer-illiterate users — this distribution assumes willingness and capability to study operation of non-mainstream operating systems and software. It is entirely possible that you do not belong to the target userbase, and that using Liberté (if found) will result in stronger negative bias from the authorities.
