My guess is that any question regarding the security of truecrypt and the CIA would be overshadowed for most people, by the likely jail time for not presenting the key to authorities. I am reluctant to switch operating systems ie from tails, just to implement secure encription. Is there an interum solution until tails implements an alternative? I dont like to have to choose between CIA and my local govermental mafia
