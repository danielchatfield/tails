> Wouldn't anyone downloading Tails under a regime which has forbidden it or which might persecute its users already be taking reasonable precautions when downloading?

Like downloading Tails through a proxy server or VPN? VPNs are probably out of the question, and proxies are inherently unreliable (who runs these proxies?) and prone to leaks.

I would like to hear from Tails about the number of mirrors available.
