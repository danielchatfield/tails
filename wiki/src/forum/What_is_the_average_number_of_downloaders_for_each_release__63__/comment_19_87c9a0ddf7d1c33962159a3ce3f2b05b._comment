> Comment 17, what sort of crap is that? 

It's not crap. Downloading large files with Tor is ALWAYS dangerous. Also, what happens if you downloaded Tails using a direct connection to the download page and you happen to be one of the few people from your country to have downloaded it? 

I think this threat is real.
