I see! You don't know them in the sense that there isn't a publically available list of them, or in the sense that you don't know their names?

I would like to read your opinion on the dangers of using Tails by political dissidents in politically repressive regimes. I think the risk is lower in say, China or Iran, because of the number of people using Tor and Tails, but what about people in countries where few people use Tor? Or even if they use Tor but not Tails?

Also, and sorry for the barrage of questions, what about expats? Like an American expat using Tails in South Korea. As of 0.14, Tails does not support Korean language support, so I doubt many native South Koreans are using it. So, in this scenario, all the South Korean goverment has to do is to subpoena the mirrors (not tails.boum.org as this would be a futile endevor since you guys don't keep loga) and compile a list of everyone who downloaded the software from a South Korean ISP. This example applies to expats not only in South Korea, but other countries like Thailand, Malaysia, etc.
