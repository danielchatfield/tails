>Like downloading Tails through a proxy server or VPN? VPNs are probably out of the question, and proxies are inherently unreliable (who runs these proxies?) and prone to leaks.

Like... [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/download)?

Otherwise, if Tails is illegal they'll watch you download it wherever the mirror happens to be and then smash your door in. No silly games with mirrors required.
