> It seems to me that the concern about mirrors may be analogous to a concern about Tor nodes: anyone can run a Tor node or a Tails mirror, with motivations ranging from desire to help dissidents to desire to murder dissidents.

It really comes down to the numbers and geographical dispersion. If you have 100 mirrors in 20 jurisdictions, then I think it's fair to say you have little to worry about. But what about 5 mirrors in 3 jurisdictions?
