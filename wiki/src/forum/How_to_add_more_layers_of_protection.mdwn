right now i use tor on a network not linked to me can i add anymore layers of protection in between tor and my netowrk so if someone breaks tor they would get another ip instead of the network. i hear vpns are not that good of a idea so is there any other way to add another layer of protection. and any other thing i can do to make tor harder to trace. thanks
