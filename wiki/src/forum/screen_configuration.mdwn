Is it possible to include a screen configuration tool like arandr? Sometimes I need to switch from cloned monitors (wich is the default) to extended desktop, so I have to:

-setup a root password
-open a terminal
-launch synaptic
-download package lists
-install arandr
-finally, I can setup monitors correctly

It's quite uncomfortable. arandr takes less than 300kb, if it can be included it will make things a little faster for me :-)
