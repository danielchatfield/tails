I don't see why it shouldn't be possible. It has matured quite nicely over the last few years, I'd also like to see it added. There's an (unfortunately horribly infantile) [todo page for Freenet](https://tails.boum.org/todo/freenet_project/) which would also be an excellent addition. As a good start, perhaps, if you have the time, you'd like to investigate what would be required to implement this idea, compose a nice rationale, then formulate this suggestion into a compelling and informative todo page for GnuNet?
