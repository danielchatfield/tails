I doubt the printing timestamps can be configured independently from the timezone set by Torbutton for iceweasel as a whole.

I believe the variable that sets iceweasel timezone is `extensions.torbutton.tz_string`. Beware: if you change its value, you're singling you out of the Tails anonymity set.
