Can someone confirm whether a netstat -ano should show an ip address connected from an exit relay. I don't have the netstat log anymore but can confirm this ip had an established connection to 80.237.226.73.

Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor.
Your IP address appears to be: 80.237.226.73


Also, I have noticed recently running a netstat -ano that ip addresses: 

31.172.30.2:443         ESTABLISHED 
31.172.30.3:443         ESTABLISHED 

or 

31.172.30.1 
31.172.30.4

or usually one of the .1-4 addresses in this subnnet are established at the beginning of a session. My understanding was that exit and entry relays are seperate and this should not occur>???
