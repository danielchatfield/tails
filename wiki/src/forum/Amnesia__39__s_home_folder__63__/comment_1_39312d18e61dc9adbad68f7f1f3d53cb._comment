Tails is designed to be a [[live distribution|about/#index2h1]], so everything is stored in the RAM. 

Except if you choose to [[save your datas on a external device|doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]] or use [[the persistence|doc/first_steps/persistence]], 
keep in mind that [[nothing you download will be saved|doc/encryption_and_privacy/your_data_wont_be_saved_unless_explicitely_asked]] !

Good luck,
