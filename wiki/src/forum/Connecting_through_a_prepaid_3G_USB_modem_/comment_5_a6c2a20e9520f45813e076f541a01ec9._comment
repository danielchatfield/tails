Thank you for the replies!
The question really isn't whether or not it is safe to connect to Tails or not. I might just use a VPN. 
But the question is - if that layer if bypassed, would it be possible to pinpoint my location, when I'm using a 3G usb modem. 

Where I live at, these little USB 3G devices are sold in hundred of shops. No cameras, paid by cash. 3G is all over the country and these devices are very popular.
