It's dead simple on my laptop. I just type...

    sudo macchanger -a eth1

...into a terminal and hit [enter] before connecting to any networks.

I believe some other WiFi adapters get different names - \"wlan0\" \"ath0\", etc instead of \"eth1\". To find the name of your adapter, right click on the sicnal strength indicator and choose \"Connection Information\"... it's at the end of the first line of information you're given. Mine looks like this:

    Interface:          802.11 WiFi (eth1)
