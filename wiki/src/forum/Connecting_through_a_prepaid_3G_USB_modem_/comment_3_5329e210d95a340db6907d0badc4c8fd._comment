Might you have been caught on CCTV? If you live under a particularly opressive and brutal regime, somewhere like China/Myanmar/Syria/UK/US/Yemen/etc, then that could be all that's necessary for you to nip off in the wee small hours of the night for a spot of torture.

It could be a sensible precaution to make such purchases by proxy in a distant town... Some sort of reciprocal arrangement with a group of street urchins perhaps - never too hard to ind at short notice. If they'll buy you your modem, you'll score them some alcopops/cigs/smack/whatever.
