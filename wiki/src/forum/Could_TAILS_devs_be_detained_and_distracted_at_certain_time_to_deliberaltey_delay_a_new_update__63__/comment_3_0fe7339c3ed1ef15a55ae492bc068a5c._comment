@ OP:

\"Detained\" and \"distracted\" are very different things; the first may be harder to resolve than the second.

I assume you were thinking of the recent thread here on a worrisome legal strategy apparently being pursued by U.S. agencies hostile to anonymity.  That is so far a theoretical concern.  A strong reaction from constituencies in the US (and elsewhere) could help prevent a dangerous legal prededent from being established which could later be used to harrass developers of tools like Tails.  Judges do pay attention to popular opinion in making decisions.
