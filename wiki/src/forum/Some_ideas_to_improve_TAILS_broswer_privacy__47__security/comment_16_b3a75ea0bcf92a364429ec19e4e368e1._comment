So, can you tell in what way the MAC address is not anonymous?
Who sees it, why, and why is that bad?

In my world it is anonymized just as well as IP address is:

The servers you are contacting cannot see your MAC address,
they cannot figure it out without compromising your computer.
Same goes for IP address.

At the worst case only the first hop in the Tor network
knows your IP and MAC address. In fact your MAC address
usually do not go further than to your ISP, if even that.
