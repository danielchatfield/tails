Actually making these options DEFAULT will help when you can't change the options because you are running a LiveDVD. Also... yes, cookies are deleted but only when you close the browser. And Javascript is always dangerous. So... I guess even in a LIveDVD is not a good idea to just go with the flow and not look at things... I go to the deep web and I like the text only websites, but I don't risk some hidden script messing with me. So... I believe making some changes to the default opions would be a good thing to do.
