coment 3. I think its smething we should consider.

As for the Ip Check test. When using:

browser.cache.disk.enable:false
broswer.cache.memory.enable:true

The test could get an unique ID of my browser (don't know if it will be the same when I reboot the system, but while the system is on, it will be an unique and identifiable ID)


If we use:

browser.cache.disk.enable:false
broswer.cache.memory.enable:false

The test can't get taht ID. They call it an ''e-tag''. No idea why such a name, but that's ok.

TAILS, can you please consider it? I am not saying I am 100% right and sure about this, I am just saying that its something to be evaluated.
