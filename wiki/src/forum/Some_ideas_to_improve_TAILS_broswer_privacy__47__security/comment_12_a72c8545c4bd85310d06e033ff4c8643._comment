hum... sorry, but I have no idea of such websites... Really, I have been using Noscript for a loooong time and in most websites, I only needed to allow the main website scripts, not anything else. Ocasionally a website would show up that was using actual stuff from other site in their page, that required me to actually DO SOME THINKING about which script to allow, but for the most part... It was just necessary the mais website.
Look, the truth is that using online browser tests, TAILS browser performed.... ok. But it showed some weaknesses that I am trying to suggest solutions for. Ok? So... Maybe we could at least try some of these.
It's just a configuration, some different options, you could have it beta tested ;)
