> The test could get an unique ID of my browser (don't know if it will be the same when I reboot the system, but while the system is on, it will be an unique and identifiable ID)

Is this unique ID preserved after using the Torbrowser \"New identity\" feature?

I'm sorry, but most of these suggestions have been made and discussed many times already, generally without any serious arguments in their favour but something along the lines of \"OMG ip-check is not entirely green\". We're not going to revisit our configuration choices every time Yet Another Someone comes up with \"hey, did you know preference X does exist, and ip-check is not all green\". We'll be happy to revisit it when good reasons are provided to do so, that take into account usability and previous discussions.
