No, actually I tested it and if I use new identity the etag is also changed. HOWEVER it remains the same while you keep the same ''session''. So I would guess you are right in not paying a lot of attention to this one point (though I fail to see why keep that string in ''true'').

As for the rest, it's not about ''OMG ip check is not all green''. It's about ME personally believing that TAILS would have a better security with javascript handled differently (cookies would be too much work for a non-geek person to handle correctly, so I will let that one slide, even because cookies are cleared when you use NEW IDENTITY just like in previous point).

So, I have made my sugestions, now you do whatever you want with them. Case closed, I am here to help, not to waste my time or your time with discussion.
Keep up the good work.
