I agree with some of what you say, but object to this:

> Mark the two ''block bad websites'' in the security page in iceweasel preferences. Why would we not want to block those???

We would, all other things being equal, but to find out whether the \"central authority\" thinks a url to which we are surfing is bad, our browser has to ask the \"central authority\".  Which gives that no doubt trustworthy organization a log of our web-browsing.  Which might be fine, except that some Bad Guy might break in and snarf it.  All in all, too many things not under our control for privacy/anonymity-promoting tool, I think.
