[Everyone is wasting time here. You lack skill to make suggestions.](https://tails.boum.org/forum/dont_be_too_happy_about_the_new_forum_to_come.../)

correct work flow

* search the Torbrowser bug tracker for what you suggest
* read the previous discussion
* if not already suggested then open a new ticket
* if accepted provide a patch

People reading the bug tracker and fixing such things are usually not people reading this forum.
