See [[todo/Add_Gnome_PPP_for_Dial-Up_Users]] for more information on tentative dial-up support. To sum it up: it's unlikely that it will work if NetworkManager does not get support for old style serial modem.

Mobile broadband works fine and DSL or other PPPoE connections should work fine as well. All of them can be configured through *System* → *Preferences* → *Network Connections*.
