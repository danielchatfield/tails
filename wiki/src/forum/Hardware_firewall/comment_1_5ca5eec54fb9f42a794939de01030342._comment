>Is it safe to run Tor from your home computer without a hardware firewall?

Yup

>I'm assuming having a firewall isn't a major requisite, since people are using Tails on public wi-fi networks, but just checking.

The software firewall in Tails is brutally harsh. Only allowing Tor & I2P traffic to see out (normally - I'm ignoring the \"unsafe\" browser shenanigans for simplicity). It almost certainly affords better protection than a hardware device would!.. unless you'd spent considerable effort setting it up just like Tails'! :D

>Also, is there any correlation between the way you connect to the internet (dial-up, DSL, T1, etc) and security?

Might be worth thinking about NAT, etc if your connection is indirect... but nothing significant springs to mind.

>Actually, I think Tails doesn't even support Dial-up, but you get the point.

Sadly not

>Does Tails support pppoeconfig?

Can't help at all there.  Never tried, never looked.
