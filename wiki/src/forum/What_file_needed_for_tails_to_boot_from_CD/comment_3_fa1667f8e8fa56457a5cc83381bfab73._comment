Lots of spare room because it's a 4gb DVD (Not CD but you knew what i ment)

I know how to make a windows DVD bootable but would not know how to merge the .iso image with any other OS to make the disk boot up and just exspected to burn the .iso job done.

On the usb stick i used the tool and it completed witout error after following the instructions and that copied and unpacked the ISO image and added an extra file to the root.
