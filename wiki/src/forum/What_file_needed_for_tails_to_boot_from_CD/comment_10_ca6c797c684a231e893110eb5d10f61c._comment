OK i can admit when i was wrong

my machine is very new had has some new BIOS disk options and it will boot OK from a windows 7 disk but would not work with the taills disk but i pressed f9 (boot options on HP) and selected dvd-rom and bingo

Tails loaded, everything worked and i was on the tinternet in seconds once i worked out where my wifi web-key went so then I made a usb-boot disk for tails & booted from my USB no trouble, set persistant storage but not worked out how to get it to save my web-key.

this thing is the dogs balls (compliment in english) and i love the xp-mode that helped to get me started.

>>>>>>>>>>>> WELL IMPRESSED INDEED, Thanks for the help <<<<<<<<<<<
