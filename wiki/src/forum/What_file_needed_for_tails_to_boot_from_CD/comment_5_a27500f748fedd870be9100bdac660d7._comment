I read the help for tails does not boot and i have also described what i have done to write the .iso image to a DVD-Rom and i simply used windows 7 Iso burner to write the image so i am not sure what else i can say.

Right click, Burn , insert DVD, Does not boot, think files are missing for OS so what files should i see in the root of the newly burnt DVD or does no one here know that answer.

Think i will call it quits and wait until Tor comes up with something that work as it says on the box
