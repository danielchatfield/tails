Answer1:
comment 1
There are issues with the clock not synchronising which results in Tor not connecting - set the date/time manually with, e.g.:
date -s '2011-09-28 10:23'
Not sure which key you are referring to otherwise.

Question2:
doesnt work too
the system says: you are not authorized to do that. its a wep 64/128 bit key connection and the therefore required key is not accepted and not stored from talis. trying to connect to the internet the key is asked and asked again and again from talis. on other software plattforms and computers the connection works very well!!!!! its unbelievable.
