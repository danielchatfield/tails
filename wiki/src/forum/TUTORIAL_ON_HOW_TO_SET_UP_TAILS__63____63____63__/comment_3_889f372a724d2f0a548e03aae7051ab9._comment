whatever you need to know to start is here:

https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html

follow this steps:

- download Tails image (using bittorrent if you can)
- verify it (look for the \"using the criptographic signature\" paragraph)
- burn it with whatever program you have
- start your PC using the DVD you just created (read the \"start Tails\" paragraph)

Tails includes Tor and it really doesn't matter if you already have it installed or not
