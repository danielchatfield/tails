>I appreciate the help but I need something much more detailed 

Which part of comment 3 do you not understand please?

Would you know how to:

- download the Tails ISO using BitTorrent?
- burn the ISO on to a DVD?
- configure your PC or laptop computer to boot from a DVD?

I need to know your answers to the above questions so that I can help you better.
