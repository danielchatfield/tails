yeah I saw that but it was unsure about the recorder program for xp. I just need a full blown walkthrough for everything or a link to one if it exists. Also which version should I download? the bitorrent or the other one. Another question I have is wheather or not Tor is included in the download or what happens if you already have Tor but tails and what happens and how to uninstall the other version of tor once I have tails
