>Including what materials (brand) etc.

Any reputable DVD-R should do you fine... slightly depends on *your* drive though (brand, model *and* firmware version)... try one and see.

>Including what downloads are needed like pgp, dvd burning downloads etc. for windows xp and 7.

You'll need PGP or GnuPG along with the signing key for download verification. I believe [InfraRecorder](http://infrarecorder.org/) and [ISOBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) are often recommended to <strike>hapless victims of the black prince</strike> satisfied microsoft customers.

>I'm assuming the dvd is the safest way to go.

Indeed, WORM media have obvious advantages in this context.
