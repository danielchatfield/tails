As a native English speaker Ii often relie on a spellin checker to catch meye frequent misspellins. Since Ii often misspell the same words in the same ways, Ii am afraid that my particular pattern of misspellin could become part of meye traceable digital footprint. Ii am using Tails to try to be anonymous and I could face serious repercussions if my identity...

An English spellin checker for both the OpenOffice.org Writer or Iceweasel would be a major privacy enhancement for everypne.

I think this is definitely [a bug](https://tails.boum.org/bugs/) rather than a topic for discussion. Ii'm sure Ii remember seein this discussed and that the conclusion wos \"fix once Tails.iso > 700mb\" and the size pressure is gone. Well Tails has been larger than a CD for a couple of iterations now... perhaps this has been forgotten. Couldn't find that discussion anywhere either. Care to report the bug OP?
