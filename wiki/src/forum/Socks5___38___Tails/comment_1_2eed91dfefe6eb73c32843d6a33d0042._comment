Unless I'M totlally misunderstanding, the purpose of that option is to make it connect to the Tor network trough that proxy, not the other way around. In other words:
(you) <---> (Socks5) <---> (Tor Node) <---> (Tor Node) <---> (Exit Node) <---> (Website)
 
The only use I can think off off hand would be when you're behind some kind of firewall and all outside connections have to go through the proxy.
