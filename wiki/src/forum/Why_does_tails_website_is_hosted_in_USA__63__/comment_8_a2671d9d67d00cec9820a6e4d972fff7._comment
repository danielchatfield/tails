> I do think the USA is a country to stay out of, if possible. Along with China, the middle east, and some others. They are just more intrusive into the lives of their citizens than they should be. I would rather not even give them a foothold by hosting in them. 

Correct my friend. Lets continue to spread the word. US is unfree country just as China.

Maybe many years ago US was a free country.

Dear American friends, \"Land of the Unlimited Possibilities\" - \"The American **Dream**\" - \"From dishwasher to millionaire\" - that was your glory past. Get over with it. You are now a unfree fascist Draconian country committing making a nuisance of yourself bringing the world your so called democracy with war crimes. Accept it. It hurts. Sorry. Now do something about it. I love your all just do something about your fascist system, thanks.

I tell that everyone. Every American I meet. It's so easy I can make up my point using their own main stream media and official governmental statements. Maybe if they finally realize they do something about it.
