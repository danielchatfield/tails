(irony) What a nice way to speak of people volunteering their free-time to make a difference toward a better world... May I inquire about your usefulness? 

I have no doubt you are useful but to other kinds of people entirely, troll/adversary. I would say to stop from attempting to lower tails dev morale but it would be foolish to expect you to comply.

Then again do not bother answering. You are unworthy of my time or attention and I refuse to be baited to a flame.

@ Tails devs: Thank you all for your work :) it is very much appreciated by many :) please try not to be discouraged by comments such as #12.
