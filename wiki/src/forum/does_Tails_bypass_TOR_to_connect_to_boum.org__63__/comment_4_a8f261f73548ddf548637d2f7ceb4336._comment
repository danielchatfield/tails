Thanks for the response.

I wasn't aware that a snapshot of the forum was included - all makes sense now. My computer can't handle the offline forum though (slows down to a motionless crawl - so not sure how helpful it is but I like the idea nonetheless).

I did a little research, it was that *Anonymous* callsign was appearing as *Anonyme* and that the date of the posts were appearing *en francais*.

There is no way to reproduce as it seems to happen intermittently (one forum post has it but then the next doesn't). I checked out Boum.org and realized that its a French service so perhaps it's just a glitch?
