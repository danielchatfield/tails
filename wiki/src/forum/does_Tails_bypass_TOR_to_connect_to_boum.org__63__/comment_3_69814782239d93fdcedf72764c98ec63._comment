In Tails **no** connection is done in the open (i.e. without Tor or I2P), including those to `boum.org`. A future version of Tails will include the so called Unsafe Browser which will be an exception to this rule, but that will be made ample clear to the user that s/he opts out from that general rule when starting the Unsafe Browser.

The forum isn't translated at all, so this is surprising. Can you post exact steps to reproduce this?

> It seems possible to connect to the website and forum via the \"tails documentation\" icon on the desktop before Vidalia has succesfully connected to TOR.

The \"Tails documentation\" is simply a local, static snapshot of the complete website (including the forum) from when the Tails release image was built.
