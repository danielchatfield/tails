Thanks for replying.

Right after making my first post, clicking on the same link took me to a torproject.org page where the ISO and the signature files were hosted.

Now, no more than an hour prior to posting this, I got that same torproject.org page but then, right now, I get 
http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-0.7/

Is it normal for the locations to automatically switch like this?

Thanks again.
