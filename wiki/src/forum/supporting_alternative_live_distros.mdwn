I didn't notice any reference to other live cd/anonymity projects on the Tails website. Can anyone point out where these links are if they exist? A reference is made to Privatix on the main page as a "source of inspiration". Tails is given clear preference by TOR with a bold and again i believe exclusive link to Tails on its main page and also on Wikipedia. Isn't it in the interest of Tails users to include clear links to alternative software which may offer complimentary services?
