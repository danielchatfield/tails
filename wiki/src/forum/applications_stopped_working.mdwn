first sorry for my not so good english.

i installed tails to an usb stick with unetbootin an put i into pc and launched my vmware to look at it, everythings nice so you get my first plus point but after i tried starting some programs (bitcoin wallet as an example) it wont start. the first time i launched tails it worked fine with the openjdk but now after a few reboots and trys in the vmware and laptop i can only choose "openjdk 6 web start" and with that it wont work. what did i do wrong so i cant start programs anymore?
