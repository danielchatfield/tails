1. Installed Tails - tails-i386-0.13 - with

unetbootin-windows-581 on a 16 Gb usb stick with usb 3.0 support.

Booted with the above configured usb stick -it worked - on both notebooks

after Tails was booted I opened Tails Live Usb
creator selcted my other 8 Gb usb stick with only usb 2.0 support and installed succesfully.


The Tails live 8 gb usb stick only works with my 7 year old notebook with 2.0 usb stick slots.


With my 1 year old notebook \"No operating system found\" it only has 3.0 Usb slots.


My current Notebook is the Dell Xps 15 L502x
