After running Tails OS from live dvd on a MacBook, having trouble booting from Mac OS X again.  Open firmware password protection is blocking the usual keyboard commands to boot from OS X, is there a way to set my Macintosh HD with Mac OS as the startup disk from inside Tails OS?  Sorry I am such a Noob.
