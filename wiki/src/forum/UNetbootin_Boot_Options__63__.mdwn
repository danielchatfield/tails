Hey everyone. I downloaded the .iso, selected it through UNetbootin, put it on my flashdrive, and BIOS is properly configured. It seems I get a quick flash of a few options from UNebootin when my computer boots and then I get taken into what appears to be a Linux OS. One of the options I noticed before the menu went away was "Live" which I recognize from my Tails .iso. Do I need to select "Live" or some other option from the list UNetbootin flashes me when I start my computer to boot Tails? Also does UNetbootin launching first reduce or negate the effectiveness of Tails? If so can you recommend another USB booting program that currently works with Tails? Thanks.
