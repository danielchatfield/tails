This is my copy of Tails OS. There are many copies like it, but this one is mine. My Tails is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

My Tails withoud me, is useless. Without my Tails, I am useless. I must use my Tails carefully. I must be more careful than my enemy who is trying to find me. I must disappear before he tracks me. I *will*.

My Tails and myself know that what counts in this war is not the truths we uncover, the noise of the media, or the rage of authorities. Whe know that it is the number of free men that counts. And I *will* evade repression.

My Tails is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its configs, its applications, its encryption and its connection. I will keep my Tails up-to-date and ready, even as I am up-to-date and ready. We will become part of each other. We *will*.

My Tails and myself are defenders of my country. We are the master of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until there is no enemy, but freedom!
