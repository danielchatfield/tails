Using TOR/TAILS is not illegal in any country so far and you can use it anywhere.

If the TAILS has a facility to become a relay, all the employees after official hours, keep their computers running with TAILS BOOT CD/USB with relay. IT will make the node of your official IP address which we can used to transmit our data thru it randomly.

If tails doesn't support creating relay, then you can use TOR, and come out of the office after owrking hours with TOR on relaying your system.

If everyone does it, we will have a lot of choices to choose nodes from all the countries TAILS/TOR will grow.

Even if your IP is misused during your absence, you can;t be held guilty as you will at the first instance set up the plea of alibi (presence somewhere else at the time of crime) a d nothing can prosecute you. You will never be in any kind of prosecution. So don't worry about it.

What's your take on it?
