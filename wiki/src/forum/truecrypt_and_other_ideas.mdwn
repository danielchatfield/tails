Hello

Since I would like to boot T(A)IL on untrusted Windows-based computers, it would be nice to give it support for most popular Windows (and quite popular in Linux) encryption program: TrueCrypt. It's open-source, has a lot of interesting features, comes with a great GUI (also for Debian) and big community of users. I believe, that also mounting of new partitions should be allowed by default user, for easier and faster exploring of HDD's :). I don't know, if it's included, but (if not) possibility of mounting NTFS should also be added (as far as I remember Incognito lacked it). Newest NTFS drivers are really stable.

Another idea is to give user a possibility to disable/enable TOR routing of all connections, because TOR is sometimes way too slow to work comfortable, especially if you don't need a top-level security. Of course it should be enabled by default. To be honest, I don't know how to do it manually (turning of proxy doesn't help). The latest version doesn't connect to the internet at all on my PC.

I would be more than happy to see this distro growing, because I'm not the only one who needs stable, reliable, versatile and anonymous system for everyday use.

Best regards
