Two amusing factoids:

* the announced US intelligence budget is currently around 50 billion annually (more if one tries to include programs hidden in other line items in the US federal budget)
* current estimates of the damage from Hurricane Sandy range up to 50 billion.

So the US is effectively hitting itself with a superstorm every year, because (I guess) it makes leaders feel less ignorant when trying to make hard decisions on the basis of little or no firm information.  

As far as I know, no-one in the US government has ever done a serious study of the cost effectiveness of maintaining America's three letter agencies.  At least one former head of a major \"Western\" communications intelligence agency says that the deluge of information offered by modern intelligence agencies with global ambititions just confuses leaders, that they'd be better off making decisions not informed by \"intelligence\" which is rarely \"solid\" and which more often than not turns out to be misleading or wrong.  Another doubting insider points out that the alleged \"precise targeting\" provided to the maintainers of the US \"kill list\" is overblown, that in practice the policy is to shoot missiles at anyone who appears to be an adult male over the age of ten and living in the tribal areas of Pakistan and Yemen, and you don't need an expensive intelligence agency to tell where to aim in that case.
