Journals for intelligence and LE people, whitepapers and marketing literature put out by state-sponsored surveillance vendors, etc., tend to support both of these statements:

* widely deployed tools enable even non-technical investigators to routinely subvert various kinds of privacy protections and cryptography (as a rule of thumb, mobiles are most vulnerable to several styles of attack)

* LE everywhere often find their investigations are thwarted by use of an unexpected protocol, encryption method, Tor, etc. (they often complain that their spanking new automatic tools make it easy for them to snoop on phone calls using such and such a protocol, but suddenly they come across a target using a protocol their tools don't know how to break).

The complexity of the universal population surveillance systems sold by certain Western companies is really astonishing, in part owing to the variety of the protocols and technologies which these systems want to subvert, and in part owing to the requirement for not only breaking in everywhere, all the time, in real time, but for logging data, transferring data to dozens of jurisdictions, while checking that all manner of security rules and even international agreements are honored.

Privacy and civil liberty groups who have been denouncing the malware sold by Gamma International, including FinSpy and FinFisher, were amused to see that the FBI just issued a general warning to mobile users warning them (in very murky terms) about the capabilities of FinSpy.  (The FBI itself uses a different tool for the same purpose, of course.)  Speculation is that this may have followed a case in which a criminal obtained such tools and used them to spy on phone calls in order to blackmail the data breach victims.  

Germany, the UK, the USA, and some others got much egg on their faces when it was revealed by Bloomberg News and other media organizations that \"Western\" companies had sold some pretty nasty universal population surveillance gear to the Gadhafi regime in Libya, the Mubarak regime in Egypt (and continues to sell to the successor regimes and many other repressive regimes in Afria, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas).

One receives the strong impression that all these governments are vying to see which will be the first to collapse under the increasingly expensive burden of operating rapidly growing universal population surveillance systems.
