It can be a small security risks in the sense that your timezone could potentially be used to guess what part of the world you're in.

But that's not why the clock is synchronized, the clock is synchronized because it has to be for TOR to be able to connect to .onion domains. If your clock is more than 2 hours off from UTC / GMT+0 then you won't be able to connect to any .onion domains.
