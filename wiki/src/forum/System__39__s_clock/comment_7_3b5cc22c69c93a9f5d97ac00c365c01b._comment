Soo..
They can pretty well know your side of the planet...
Any guides anywhere as to whether, say, the home network your ISP router potentially has wired in to tell the good ole spy associate Google enogh story about your location and possibly more?

so the users wouldn't really be anonymous...
I mean you need to first thing not have your router send you ethetnet MAC...
