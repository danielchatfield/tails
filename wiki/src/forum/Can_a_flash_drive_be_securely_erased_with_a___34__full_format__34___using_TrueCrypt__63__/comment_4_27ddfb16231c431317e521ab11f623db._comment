The documentation isn't really the place to put into discussions on tools that only probably do the work. We prefer that the documentation keeps a good shape with only relevant and known working advices. That way people don't get lost, and don't take bad habits.

Furthermore, in the future we'd like to get rid of truecrypt (see the [[corresponding todo item|todo/provide_a_migration_path_from_truecrypt/]]), so relying on it is probably not the way to go. 

If you want to discuss about tools and documentation enhancement, the best place is probably the tails-dev mailing list.
