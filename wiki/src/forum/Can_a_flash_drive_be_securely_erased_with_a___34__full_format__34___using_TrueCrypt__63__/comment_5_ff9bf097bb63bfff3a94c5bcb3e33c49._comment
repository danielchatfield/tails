Thank you. For now TrueCrypt seems to be more verifiable than shred or dd if you fill up the container and read from it. If you can read from the end of the container this means it probably filled the entire device. TrueCrypt also seemed to be faster than shred with the --random-source=/dev/urandom argument although shred is supposed to do multiple passes automatically (if it actually works on flash devices).

Okay but I have known partition tools to make bad decisions about partition alignment on harddisks without any prompt or warning. The Windows XP partitioner will delete extended partitions created with Vista's partitioner. Gparted and Norton Ghost would attempt to silently fix partition alignments which would make some Vista system partitions unbootable.

On SSDs there are a different set of problems even when you are creating a new partition table or just formating a partition. Wrong alignment can slow them to the point of being unusable.
