Your work is still accessible through the Git history: <http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob;f=wiki/src/doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion/discussion.mdwn;h=2b1d3a6ac0258ea0a9ba5f6f46a763e968b66e34;hb=b745cb6282b94ba1321307c16a196722f9a09c12>.

Tails developers do not want to endorse TrueCrypt. See the [[first section of the related documentation|doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt]].

Please note that future version of the Disk Utility will have a graphical interface to overwrite disk content: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=651760>. It might take some time to have this shipped in Tails, but that is really the best place to add such feature.
