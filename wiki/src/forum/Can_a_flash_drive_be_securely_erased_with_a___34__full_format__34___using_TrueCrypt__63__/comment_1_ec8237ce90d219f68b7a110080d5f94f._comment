Before going further, I suggest you look at the last published research on the topic: [Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-based Solid State Drives](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/swanson/papers/Fast2011SecErase.pdf) by Michael Wei, Laura M. Grupp, Frederick E. Spada, and Steven Swanson Proceedings of the 9th USENIX conference on File and storage technologies, 2011. 

Why do you think that a drive overwritten by `shred` will be filled with *random* bytes?
