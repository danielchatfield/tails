Being unknown while surfing the web isn't worth it if you cannot surf the web. It takes forever to load any pages in iceweasel, espeically sites like youtube. I loaded www.youtube.com and I wasn't able to load any of the pages with videos (waited 10min). Even loading the tails forum takes longer than I would like. 

When using my normal os (without Tor) pages load at fair speeds. Any suggestions on how I can increase internet speed? 

Thanks feedback will be aprceiated,
