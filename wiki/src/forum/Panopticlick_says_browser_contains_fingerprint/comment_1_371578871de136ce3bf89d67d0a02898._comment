Tails is shipping Torbutton in its browser: its the tool provided by the Tor project to improve the anonymity of Firefox/Iceweasel.

Every browser has a fingerprint and the point is actually to know how unique is your fingerprint: how much does it identify your browser amongst the billions of other browsers on the web. The objective of Torbutton is to make your browser look like any other browser running Torbutton. The goal is that all the people using Torbutton and thus Tails look the same, as much as possible. So that you can't know who is who, and thus provide anonymity amongst them.

As such as the Torbutton that Tails ship is to make your browser have a similar fingerprint as the one of the other people running Tor.

For example, on the Tails I'm running I get the following results. You should get similar ones, except maybe for the screen size.

If you want to read more about the finding of the EFF people on panopticlick you can read one of their white paper at [http://panopticlick.eff.org/browser-uniqueness.pdf](http://panopticlick.eff.org/browser-uniqueness.pdf). We indeed share a similar vision about browser fingerprint and anonymity tools when they say:

> The paradox, essentially, is that many kinds of measures to make a device
> harder to fingerprint are themselves distinctive unless a lot of other 
> people also take them.
