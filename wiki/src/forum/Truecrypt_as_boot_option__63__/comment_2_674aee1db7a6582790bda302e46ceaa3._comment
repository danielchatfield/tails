I assume you are looking to hack the iso image you download here to enable truecrypt on start. Here is how:

1) Unless you are running one, get yourself a linux distro. I use Ubuntu.

2) Download and compile ISO Master source from here: http://www.littlesvr.ca/isomaster/. Other ISO editing tools might work, I used this one. There is a paid-for windows version with an installer there as well if you care. 

3) Run it and open the tails iso

4) in the bottom panel go to /isolinux folder

5) Highlight \"live.cfg\"

6) Click \"Extract\" button

7) Locate the extracted file and modify it by adding truecrypt to the english menu line (or other menu if you use different language).

8) Click \"Remove\" to delete old live from the iso

9) Make sure your modified \"live.cfg\" is highlighted in the top panel and click \"Add\". This should place your changed file on the ISO image

10) Use \"Save as\" menu to save the changed image and use that image to run tails.

FYI: when those @#$@ tails developers decide to exclude truecrypt from the ISO, you can use the same method to place truecrypt binaries on the ISO. I normally used \"/live\" folder that is available once you start it. It is available from the command line after start as /live/image/live/truecrypt if you do this.
