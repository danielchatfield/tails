> The list is in order of how hard it will be to explain the process to someone who just want to use the system.

You are overestimating the difficulty of the process. You are reiterating points of articles that discuss the difficulty for users who are completely clueless and expect everything to \"just work\". Tails installation and image verification process is already way above that in terms of difficulty (wrt. enrolling a new KEK / DB key).

This is not a theoretical question. Secure Boot is already leveraged in LibertÃ© to achieve trusted boot chain.

These issues are only relevant for non-live distributions.
