@ OP:

> So what of Tails? Is the next version being prepared to deal with this?

At this stage we only have plans for supporting [[todo/UEFI]]. Regarding SecureBoot we're still undecided on how to proceed. I believe we want to see what Debian does before we act on this matter ourselves.

@ comment 1:

> Tails runs off a DVD or USB drive; it is not installed locally on a PC. It just runs in a live session from either one of those two types of removable storage media. 

The media used doesn't matter. Live systems, like Tails, are equally affected by UEFI SecureBoot.
