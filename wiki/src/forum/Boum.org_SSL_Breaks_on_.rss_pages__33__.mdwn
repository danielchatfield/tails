To anyone and everyone viewing this thread:

Please go to:

And report back on what your browser says about SSL status of the page.

In Tails, TBB as well as regular Firefox 21, across several GNU/Linux distros and different hardware, whenever I visit the above URL, I consistently get:

- No padlock in URL bar but gray globe instead 

- "Your connection to this web site is not encrypted."

Same for:
<https://blog.torproject.org/blog/feed>

Something is clearly amiss here with the respective RSS URLs of tails.boum.org as well as blog.torproject.org.
Can't just be me.
