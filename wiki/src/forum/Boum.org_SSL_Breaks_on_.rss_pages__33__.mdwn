To anyone and everyone viewing this thread:

Please go to the link in the OP
<https://tails.boum.org/forum/index.rss>

and report back on what your browser says about the SSL status.

Do you see a padlock? Does it say "unencrypted" or "partially encrypted"? Please be as specific and clear as possible. 

Thanks.

And while you're at it, might want to try Tor Blog as well:
<https://blog.torproject.org/blog/feed>

I have tried both URLs many times, in Tails, TBB as well as regular Firefox 21, across several GNU/Linux distros and with different hardware,  all with the same result: 

-"Your connection to this web site is not encrypted."

-No padlock in URL bar but gray globe instead 

So it can't just be me; something is clearly amiss here with the respective RSS URLs of tails.boum.org as well as blog.torproject.org.
