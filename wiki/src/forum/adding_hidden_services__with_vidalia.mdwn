Hi Tails team, thanks for the great work.

I have a web server running.  When I open Vidalia -> Services and add a hidden service as normal, it fails with errors.

Virtual Port 80
Target 127.0.0.1:8080
Directory Path /home/amnesia

it says Onion Address [Directory Not Found] 

Message log:

May 01 11:55:33.872 [Warning] /home/amnesia is not owned by this user (debian-tor, 106) but by amnesia (1000). Perhaps you are running Tor as the wrong user?

May 01 11:55:45.465 [Error] set_options(): Bug: Acting on config options left us in a broken state. Dying.

When I change the Directory Path to /media/USBDrive (chmod 777 so the owner doesn't matter) it returns these messages:

(On some Unix systems, anybody who can list a socket can conect to it, so Tor is being careful.)

When I delete the hidden service, Vidalia no longer connects and I have to reboot.

Please explain how to setup a Hidden Service with Tails

Also, what else should be done so that if (when) the web server is ever compromised, the attacker cannot discover the real IP address.
