Have tried to customise by blogger page muliple times while running Tails with Icewasle and the "Apply to blog" button would not work. Re-booted in windows and used Chrome and worked fine. Do not have firefox on my windows os so I could not try that. Was Iceweasle updated in the last Tails version? If not can I get intructions on how to install Chrome to my live USB and it also run tor.
Or just let me know if I should change my blog host...
Thanks for any replys
