It worked fine for me. Here's exactly what I did:

1. Booted Tails, noted which IP address I got.
2. Started I2P, noted which TCP/UDP ports it picked.
3. Shut down I2P.
4. Added port-forwarding on the TCP/UDP ports above to the IP address I got in Tails.
5. I ran these commands (adopted from the ones the OP posted):

    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST,ACK SYN --dport <TCP-port> -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport <UDP-port> -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT

6. Started I2P.
7. Verified that I got \"Network: OK\" (i.e. not firewalled) above the Shutdown/Restart buttons in the I2P router console.

Opening ports for I2P may besomething we support if its UPnP support works, but definitely not if it'll require manual configuration of your router to add port-forwarding. I can't seem to get I2P's UPnP to work in Tails, although it works with the same version of I2P on a Debian Wheezy system I tried it on.
