I don't think we want to add boot options for this kind of application-level settings.

However, I understand it's a bit painful to click twice at every boot to disallow scripts globally. Hence, I think this kind of settings might be part of those one can made persistent => added to the *Application-specific configurations* usecase in [[todo/persistence]].
