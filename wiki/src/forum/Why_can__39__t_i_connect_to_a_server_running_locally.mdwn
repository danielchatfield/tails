I have set up a local IRC server as a hidden service but cannot get it to connect. I keep getting Connection refuse error, no matter if I use Pidgin or terminal or Irssi.

In Terminal

nc localhost 6667
localhost [127.0.0.1] 6667 (ircd) : Connection refused

In Irssi
Connecting to localhost [127.0.0.1] port 6667
15:21 -!- Irssi: Unable to connect server localhost port 6667 [Connection refused]

In Pidgin
Unable to connect: Connection refused
