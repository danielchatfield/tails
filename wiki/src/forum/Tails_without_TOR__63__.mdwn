sounds a bit ridiculous considering one of the main point of tails would be to have TOR, but will there ever be a version of tails that doesn't use TOR? or is there some way to remove TOR from the OS? i wouldn't imagine there would be an easy way to do this though considering tails forces all connections to go through TOR.
