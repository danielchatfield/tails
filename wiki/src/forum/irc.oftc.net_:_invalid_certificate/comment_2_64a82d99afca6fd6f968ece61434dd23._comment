So...

I tought about a man-in-the-middle attack, so I tried using a different exit node with Vidalia 'New identity' : the message is not appearing anymore..

I'm a bit confused, and don't know what to do..

Here is the exit node's IP that I was using *when the message appeared:* **173.254.216.67**

Does anyone have knowledge about [SSL observatory](https://www.eff.org/observatory) ? Do you have any tips to investigate this deeper?
