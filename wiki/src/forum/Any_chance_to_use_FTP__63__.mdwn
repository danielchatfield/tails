Hi,

Is it possible to use Tails and an active Tor connexion for FTP transfers?

Since I read [here](https://tails.boum.org/todo/FTP_in_Iceweasel/) that "_GNOME's FTP support is great_", and [here](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop/index.en.html#index4h1) that "_To connect to remote FTP or SFTP server, go to Places â†’ Connect to Server..._", I wonder what I do wrong.

Thanks
