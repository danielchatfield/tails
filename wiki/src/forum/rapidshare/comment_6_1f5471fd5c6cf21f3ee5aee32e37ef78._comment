1.) One or more TAILS devs have cautioned not to rely-on the \"New Identity\" feature in Tor Button. They claimed it was misleading, mainly because of the problem of *already established* connections, IIRC.

But...IIRC, that was before the new \"New Identity\" function under the big green onion on the left side of the address bar. THIS one closes all existing tabs and windows and deletes all cookies. (Which is why it should never have been placed at the very top of the list like that, where it is too easy to hit accidentally...)

So I wonder: is THIS New I.D. functionality sufficient?

2.) \"MediaFire\" is the only file hosting site that I know of that last I checked seemed not to require JavaScript.
