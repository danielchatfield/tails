I'm able to do this with other LiveCDs where a /rofs directory exists.

Why unmount it?

Because I remove packages from tails (with every new session) but it doesn't do any good if /live/rofs/ remains loaded and the same packages I remove from a Live Session may still be used locally or remotely by someone else via /live/rofs/ if compromised.

I don't want /live/rofs mounted! This is why! TY
