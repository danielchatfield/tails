> But I cannot see how implementing and encouraging a public, collaborative method of bug-reporting (such as via the forum) as the preferred option would not benefit everyone involved greatly.

For the record, we generally ask for a full bug report because:

1. The question asked on the forum is incomplete: it lacks most useful information;
   on the other hand, reports received from WhisperBack tend to be much more usable,
   thanks to the \"what I'm doing / what I expect / what is happening instead\" template.
2. Asking for pieces of information one after the other is painful both for us and for the OP:
   it's painful for us because we have to try and guess what specific piece of information
   might help, instead of having a comprehensive set of logs to glance over; and it's painful
   form the OP, as they have to learn how to run commands as root etc., which quite frankly,
   I'm personally not interested in teaching on this forum.
3. We feel that we'll understand the issue much better if we get the logs.
4. The workload of handling bug reports sent through WhisperBack is better shared,
   among us Tails core developers, than dealing with the forum.

But I generally agree having a more community-oriented way to help each other would be good.

I guess one would have to patch
[[contribute/first_steps/bug_reporting]], so that it explains how
to report a useful bug on the forum. It should be made very clear
that for hardware issues, a full WhisperBack bug report is quite
more likely to be useful. See [[contribute/how/documentation]]
for hints about how to send us such patches.
