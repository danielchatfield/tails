Hi,

Today I was trying to send a thread and spent several hours on it. It was a detailed thread about search plugins configuration + installation which I think many people could benefit from.

I previewed it so many times, so can it be on your database or logs? After that I tried 3-4 times to Save Page but it caught by the spam tool. Maybe there is a list of spam messages? Please find the thread if possible and post it here.

The title was "DuckDuckGo Onion as a Search Plugin"

Thanks
