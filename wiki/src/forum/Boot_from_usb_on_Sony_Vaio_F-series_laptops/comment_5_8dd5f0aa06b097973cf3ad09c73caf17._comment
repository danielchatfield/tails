Thanks for the tip.  

Debian Squeeze has grub2 with efi support:  http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/grub-efi

This guy evaluates different ways of dual booting Debian Squeeze with UEFI: http://william.shallum.net/random-notes/windows-7-linux-uefi-dual-boot

Doesn't work on all machines: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674849

As usual, Debian is good but moving slowly on an important issue.  I guess (sigh) Tails is going to wait for upstream Debian Live (Squeeze) stable to introduce UEFI support and then it'll get built into the Tails ISO.  This is a disadvantage of basing anything on Debian Stable, they've always been too slow.

Why not look at Liberte's UEFI support and port that across to Tails?

Btw ArchLinux has an excellent rundown on UEFI here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface
