Gnome 3 isn't very userfriendly for the average computer novice, rather complicated.

Why is providing a second solution so difficult? wouldn't it be mere preinstalled packages + the common selection menu from the login?
Wouldn't i be able to do this with persistance anyway?

Is there no way to keep Gnome 2 with wheezy?

My easy-to-use-suggestion would have been cinnamon, but it's not very widespread yet.
