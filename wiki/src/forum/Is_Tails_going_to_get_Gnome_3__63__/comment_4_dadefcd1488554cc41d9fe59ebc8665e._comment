I think Gnome 3 can be a problem for older hardware.

When I tried running Ubuntu and Mint with Gnome 3 live, my almost ten year old system with Celeron 1.4 GHZ CPU and 2 GB of RAM would crash.

I did not have this problem with TAILS as well as several versions of Ubuntu and Mint and other distros that used older versions of Gnome.
