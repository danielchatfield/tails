Tails [[design document states|contribute/design/#index5h3]] that its *target user is the average user in terms of computer literacy*. We feel GNOME targets the same userbase and is thus a good fit for Tails.

Feel free to start your own project if you feel differently, be it [[based on Tails|contribute/git]] or not.
