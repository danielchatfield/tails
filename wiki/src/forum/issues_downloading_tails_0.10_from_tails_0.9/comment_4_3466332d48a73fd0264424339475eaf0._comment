To make your life easier, just follow comment 1 on that thread instead, i.e.:

0. Right-click the \"Onion\" icon -> Preferences in Iceweasl to enter the Torbutton preferences.
  0. Select \"Use custom proxy settings\".
  0. Clear all fields on the rows for \"HTTP Proxy\" and \"SSL Proxy\".
  0. Press the \"OK\" buttom.
0. Tools -> Add-ons: Select \"FoxyProxy\" and press the \"Disable\" button.
0. Restart Iceweasel.
0. Download as large files as your RAM allows.

To see approximately how large fiels you can download, enter `df -h` in a terminal and check the `Avail` value on the row where `/` is `Mounted on`.
