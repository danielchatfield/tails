The primary use of tails is a browser.  Ok, so why all the bulk in the cd?

Is it possible for you to remove the ability for others to drop connect to Tail and drop to a root shell?  I notice it's possible to run as root.  Root should not be possible!

No if, an, or buts about it!

Could you include Remastersys so we could remaster it with maybe a few internet tools and or get some bookmarks hard wired into the browser?

Shouldn't Tails be based upon freebsd or openbsd?  Isn't this the real locked down security platform?
