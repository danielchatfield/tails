@ OP:

I believe that your concern about peripherals such as routers is valid.  In my opinion this is clearly shewn by the recent \"internet survey\".  By the way, I think I can make a pretty shrewd guess as to who is behind that.  Not the developer I saw mentioned on one website, but someone who has been mentioned here before as a gifted hacker with a track record of walking up to the line between ethical and unethical research, and then jumping right over it.

I understand the temptation to do something which shouldn't be possible before angry governments cause vendors to cut out all that default password crap, but... in my opinion he probably should not have done that.  Not that I want to see our adversaries harrass him to death in retaliation for showing how easy it is to bust up a large fraction of all the world's networks (no doubt the Powers didn't want this to be demonstrated because they have been using those default passwords for years, as is verified from multiple sources).
