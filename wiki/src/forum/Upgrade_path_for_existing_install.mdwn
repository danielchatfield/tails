In anticipation for the next version of this amazing distribution, what would be the upgrade path for those with an already established live USB install?

I have a persistent install as well as some external persistence using the options in the configuration menu.

Would I have to re-do all of this to install the next version or is there/will there be a relatively simple upgrade path?
