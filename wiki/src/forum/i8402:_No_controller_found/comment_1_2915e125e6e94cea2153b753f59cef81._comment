Unfortunately, properly supporting Apple hardware is a delicate task and currently we lack time, resources and hardware to do so properly. See [[todo/UEFI]] and other posts on the forum for some information on where we currently stand. To make it simple: if it does not work, you are mostly on your own.

You can always use Tails using virtualization software (VirtualBox is free software and works on Mac OS X). Please be aware of the implied security issues: [[doc/advanced_topics/virtualization]].

We sincerily hope to improve the situation at some point, but do not expect it to happen tomorrow.
