The user-agents from both TBB and Tails are taken from Torbutton.

Torbutton was using \"Firefox/5.0\" in its user-agent until version 1.4.5.1, which is the one shipped in Tails 0.12.

Starting from version 1.4.6, which came out after Tails 0.12, Torbutton uses \"Firefox/10.0\" in its user-agent. The latest version of TBB, version 2.2.37, uses Torbutton 1.4.6.

That should get fixed in the next release.
