Ah, I see that tails 0.10 has come out. Terrfic, can't wait to see how much better it is than 0.9. 

I'm rather new to tails and haven't had 0.9 that long. So I have never gone through the proccess of updating. Is there some way I can update tails or do I have to install the whole system again? How would I go about doing either one of these (commandline, etc.)?
