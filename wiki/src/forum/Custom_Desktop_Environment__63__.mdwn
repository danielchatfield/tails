Hi there people sorry for my bad English... Wel I love this project but I want it to have a really easy desktop example..


On the desktop
Browser, Open office, Mail, Calculator,file manager
On the top panel
Time,volume,wifi (the regular system tray..) nothing else 

And nothing else i want even the right click to be disabled...

Do I need to recompile the whole source to do this or simple edit will get me there?
