First and foremost, thanks for an awesome distro!

I read through the T(A)ILS documentation on persistent home folders. It seems that the options referenced are simply not available in the GUI, and I'm honestly not Linux-savvy enough to figure this out.

So, my situation is that I'm using a 2GB USB flash drive, and would like to have an encrypted home folder or TrueCrypt volume available.

The documentation is outdated and doesn't tell me how to do this. And I've tried to Google myself a solution but I am falling flat on this.

So... how do you do it in 0.5?

(Also, any info on how to add programs without recompiling the whole thing would be awesome).

Looking forward to the next version!
