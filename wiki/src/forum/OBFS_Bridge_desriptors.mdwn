Hi. Sorry for opening a new thread for this specific inquiry. I have commented on OBFS bridges earlier thread but due to this forum's functinality the thread will stay way down the list even with recent comments that most probably will never be noticed. 

On topic: OBFS bridge descriptors are quite revealing of their nature, ones such as (I-am-a-tor-bridge). Wouldn't that be against the whole idea of OBFS bridges? Are these descriptors seen to sniffers (ISPs, adversaries...) or just announcements on client level?

Thanks and please never mind the redundancy.
