Hallo,
i was reading that program an EntryGuard function  in Tails would be hard.  Why?
I'am not a programmer but why its not a problem to integrate a BRIDGE-mode and impossible to switch on EntryGuard
on bootmenu ?
It would be  the same configure mechanism ?

And very important for using Tor safe.
