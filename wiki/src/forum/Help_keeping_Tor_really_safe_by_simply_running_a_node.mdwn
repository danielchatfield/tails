I bet that a growing amount of nodes are owned by governments and their traffic analysis capabilities are getting bigger and bigger to correlate entry IP's with exit IP's.

To help preventing that, every Tor-user should at least run Tor as a middle node because especially these kind of voluntar nodes are making the anonymity stronger for all users (end-to-end correlations are getting more difficult for adversaries when nodes that are not owned by them increase).

You only have to select in Settings --> Sharing, your choice of sharing traffic. 

I felt I had to post this because most people think that there enough users who are running a node so why should I. But the problem is that too many people think like that..
