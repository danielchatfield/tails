I want to either build tails so that either it will read my openvpn conf from USB or put my conf files on the image, and only start TOR *after* my VPN is connected. Or bare minimum stop tails from connecting to TOR before I can setup my VPN. This way no matter what anywhere I connect to the TOR network only my VPN will ever see me connecting to TOR. Any possible way to do this? maybe some kind of key command to stop TOR from connecting during boot?
