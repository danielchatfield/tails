Hi,

I recently found this page, which I found really useful in helping me install programmes in Tails.

https://tails.boum.org/forum/Install_apps_quickly___38___without_downloading/

One of the features I found particularly useful was the Wine download for allowing you to install .exe programmes in Tails. 

I was wondering whether this is to be recommended? I have used it to install Winrar and Piriform CCleaner. Is this safe? I know there are Linux programmes that I could install, but having used Windows all my life, there are some programmes I would like to continue using.

Also, related to this, can someone recommend a good source(s) for finding useful .deb files to install, please?

Thank you.
