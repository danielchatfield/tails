Hello

I'm currently running Tails in virtualbox on windows 7 x64. I was wondering if it would be possible to install grsecurity or any other kind of mandatory access control security system? I noticed it was on the 'ToDo' page for a coming release, but was just wondering if someone could help me out installing it on 0.5?

Thanks.
