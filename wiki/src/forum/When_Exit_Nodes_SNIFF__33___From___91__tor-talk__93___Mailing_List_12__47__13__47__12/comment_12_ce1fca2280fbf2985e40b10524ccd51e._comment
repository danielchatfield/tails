Tor is one of the main parts of Tails and should be discussed here. but of course, admin of forum will not answer. simply they don't have answer, they based linux distro on the tor network and this network is not anonymous for developers of tor and their snitches who run tor nodes. but tails team doesn't have other solution. nobody interested for anonimity has money as american imperialists in order to develop some new similar tor network.
