I am not against off topic talk in this forum. It's just stupid to discuss it here and to hope to archive anything.

You really should take this to tor-talk. You wont get answers from knowingly people here. Just blind people answering blind people how color looks like.

One example here, I don't have to time answer all of the false claims.

> On the other hand, doesn't opfsproxy attempt to disguise encrypted traffic as unencrypted traffic, for good purposes? Possibly one should be familiar with such schemes before drawing conclusions.

This is absolute basic knowledge.

Just put obfsproxy into the searchbox and read the first three results.

https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en
\"obfsproxy is a tool that attempts to circumvent censorship, by transforming the Tor traffic between the client and the bridge.\"

Exit nodes won't know, can't know and are certainly in no way affected if anyone uses obfsproxy or not.

> The tor-talk list is a mailing list. As far as I know there is (by design?) nothing resembling anonymous submission.

You register a e-mail account anonymously, register and post? Thousands of users doing it. What's the big deal? If you fail its granted you fail with Tails anyway.

You get way more readers. Way more quality answers. Sometimes developer answers.

What you get here? Only blinds talking to blinds about color.
