I'm not sure what it is you're trying to achieve here. Hoovering up nebulous paranoia from around the web and spewing it into the Tails forum. Do you presume that everyone who uses Tails must be some sort of conspiracy nut and therefore an eager audience? Perhaps you seek to paint the Tails community as some sort of anarchist conspiracy nut coven? Or maybe you've undertaken on some sort of DoS attack - hoping to smother the community with a thick blanket of mindless crap?

Whatever your motives, please piss off.
