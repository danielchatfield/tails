Comment #2 objected to this post being in this forum because Tor discussion is not welcome here as has been declared in multiple forum thread by the Tails devs.

These relentless vacuous ramblings serve no good to anyone and are an ***unnecessary and unwelcome*** burden on the **Tails** project.

You're being given the benefit of the doubt. **If** you **do** mean well, comprehend what you've been told and get a grip on your loquaciousness.

But why take the communities word for it? There's a search box provided to help you educate yourself. Type \"<i> resources general</i>\" into it and then click upon the little magnifier icon. Savour the results. [E.g.](https://tails.boum.org/forum/3G_USB_cell_modem_-_is_MAC_change_possible_+_what_of_IMEI__44___MEID__63__/#comment-7d1cbd10531d77a37d9d54f6c285ee7f). Digest, assimilate and understand. Understand?
