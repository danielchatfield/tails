@ comment 4

I'm not the author of comment 2 but I can answer your question.

The Tails Developers have made it clear many times in the past that the Tails Forum is only meant for discussing things specific to Tails (the OS) and not for discussing other things.

Tor discussion in particular has been discouraged on this forum multiple times as Tor has their own discussion systems that is better suited for such discussions.
