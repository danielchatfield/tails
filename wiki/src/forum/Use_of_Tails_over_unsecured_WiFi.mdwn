So I hesitate to ask this question but I can't find a clear answer elsewhere.  For security's sake I regularly connect to different WiFi networks throughtout my area. Some of them are unsecured, "open" Wifi networks. 

What I want to know is how secure is my connection from my laptop to the Tor network since anyone with the right software can intercept and analyze my network traffic.  What kind of security and/or encryption exists in Tails that would make my network traffic safe?  Or am I risking too much by using Tails over an open WiFi network.  

I think this question would apply to many security-sensitive users who have to move from place to place to avoid being monitored.
