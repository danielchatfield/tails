newbie is confused

when I open the map, it shows several "connections" and
to the right of that in another box shows 3 more

are the 3 shown to the right my "3 hops"?

why are there several "connections" shown if there are
supposed to be 3 hops?

what really has me confused is that none of the ips shown in the connections or in the box to the right match the ip
shown in the homepage of iceweasel "your ip appears to be
----"
