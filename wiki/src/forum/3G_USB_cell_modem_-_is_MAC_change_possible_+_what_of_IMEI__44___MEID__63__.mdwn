i use a 3G USB cellular modem with my netbook to access the internet and was wondering if its possible (or even advisable) to try one of the MAC changer or MAC randomizer type programs on it?  on another forum they said the cell tower might not recognize the device (so no internet service) and another poster chimed in that it might be illegal, akin to "stealing internet service" iirc.

And then what of these IMEI and MEID numbers for 3G modems? are they being transmitted to my ISP and website servers on down the line?
