Hi,
Is Tails realy secure? I do not really understand how rights for users are set? Actually strict right regulations are the basis of a security strategy. How does it work about the sudo password?

When I see that it is possible to do everything without a su password I am not so sure about it. 

For example what does Tails do to prevent somebody from the Internet to access my hdd on which my OS is installed and change its data? 

Can I prohibit access to my hard drive and su-mode?

Best wishes
