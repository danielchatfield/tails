Or did I misunderstand what happened?

Is this what you experienced?  You tried to go to the Tor Project website at  https://www.torproject.org and instead landed at the http://upload7.ir website?  That would definitely indicate something bad happened, if so.

Is https working for you at all at any website?  (You should see a \"lock icon\" at left in the \"url pane\" (the place where you can type a URL or web address in Firefox, Iceweasel, Tor browser, Tails browser, or other web-browsers).  Even better, if you have a packet sniffer like Wireshark you can look for ssl.handshake packets.
