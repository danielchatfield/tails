\"No one other than yourself is interested in this nonsense.\"

What a queer response. Is there a survey in Tails which provides you with this result? No. I'm someone who likes to dig deep into distros and tweak them to my liking. I want to know exactly what programs are running, and especially those listening. 

There are a lot of users like me, but they're not using Tails or just don't care.

This forum is overly negative in answering most users' questions. This is not normal. The developers of Tails are not gods and they should learn how to humble themselves and be grateful they have users at all, considering the anonymous authors and negative responses. Not the best way to establish trust by being negative to your users.

Digging through a distro and reviewing its parts is how both improvements and tips/tricks are found to help the users and developers.

\"If you're determined to waste your time then that's your prerogative,\"

Was the question too difficult for you? I'll take my questions elsewhere and may eventually stop using Tails. I have an established crowd of thousands who will listen to me should I recommend against the use of Tails and I have many reasons to point out why.

\"Don't harbour too much hope for getting others to join you though.\"

Others will join me, elsewhere. But you have proven this \"forum\" isn't suitable for friendly Q&A.

\"P.S. \"Bump\"ing doesn't work on this pseudo-\"forum\".\"

No? Probably why you don't have an established community here, because the \"forum\" software sucks and so do most of the responses. I smell a honeypot.
