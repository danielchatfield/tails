I do not agree with the quotation of the Tor FAQ. 
Where is the security when you get a known spy node as an entry guard after starting TAILS? 

Picking nodes with the torrc introduces an element of randomness against fined tuned metrics of spying nodes.

I admire Tails but not beeing able to tune my torrc has prevented me from using it regularly.

Thanks to Tom for the advice. Am I correct that this instruction is not applicable to the live cd? 
The file \"/etc/tor/torrc\" there would not be writable I suppose. 

Any advice on using a custom torrc with the cd?
