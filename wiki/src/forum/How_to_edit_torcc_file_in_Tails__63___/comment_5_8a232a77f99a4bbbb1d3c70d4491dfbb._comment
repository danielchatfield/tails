I first boot up TAILS on my computer without the router turned on - this is to
prevent network access prior to making edits like this and to change my mac
address prior to accessing the Internet.

Here is how I do it:

1.Become root (aka superuser/admin):

    sudo -i

2.Now, issue the following cmd to find the hard drive device names:

    fdisk -l (lower case L)

3.Make a mount point for the hard drive:

    mkdir /mnt/sddx (where x is the relevant hard drive partition number)

4.Mount the hard drive partition:

    mount -v -t ext3 /dev/sddx /mnt/sddx (ext3 is the filesystem type on my system)

5.Change directory to where the torrc file additions are located:

    pushd /mnt/sddx/root/amnesia (Note: popd is inverse cmd of pushd)

6.Locate the file to append to /etc/tor/torrc and append it:

    cat torrc-append-file.txt >> /etc/tor/torrc

7.To make changes to the torrc file (other than just appending to it as I do):
    Invoke the vi/vim editor, or gedit, or your favorite text editor:

    vi /etc/tor/torrc

8.Make your edits and save them with \":wq\" NOT in an editing mode inside vi/vim

    vi/vim cmds are:

    o (to open a new line)
    i (to insert)
    a (to append)
    q (to quit)
    ESC (to close edit mode)
    :wq (to quit and save)
 
    Advice: play around with vi/vim before to do it to the /etc/tor/torrc
    file (to make it easy on yourself if you don't know vi/vim).
