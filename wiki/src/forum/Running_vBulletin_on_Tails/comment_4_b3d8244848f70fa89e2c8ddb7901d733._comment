Unless you had a dedicated server with ridiculous amount of memory there is no way your Vbulletin install isn't going to slowly grind to a halt. What you need is back end databases encrypted and a solid locked down Gentoo, Debian, or OpenBSD front end hosting the Vbulletin pages.

You should also know Vbulletin is full of holes. Google 'finding 0day in Vbulletin 4'. PhpBB at least has no known security exploits floating around unpatched at the moment and can be stripped down to bare essentials unlike Vbulletin.
