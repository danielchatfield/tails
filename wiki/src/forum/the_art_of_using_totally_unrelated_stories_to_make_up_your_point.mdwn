OMG tor-talk not safe!!!!! [Email lessons from Gen. Petraeus' downfall](https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9233653/Email_lessons_from_Gen._Petraeus_downfall)

* Pro tip: there is a difference of singing up a fresh anonymous account and anonymously posting on a public mailing list from your private home machine using Tails never using the account for something else and sitting on your work machine not using Tor communicating with someone you know and meeting.

* Pro tip: not that I like java. I hate it because programs who use are slower than programs written in C or C++. How is Java less secure than C or C++? There are enough people constantly messing up C and C++ code so we constantly have to update.
