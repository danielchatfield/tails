Hello,

On the download page of this wiki: https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html

In section 4, the instructions make this statement:
"This technique also works for SD cards. Some SD cards have a read-only switch that can prevent your Tails from being altered."

Please be aware that the read-only switches on SD Cards are entirely advisory.  No SD Card implementations change behavior of the SD Card itself based on the position of the switch.  Instead, host hardware and OS can check for the position of the switch and behave accordingly.  This is an optional feature of the SD specification.

The read-only state of an SD Card simply cannot be relied on for anything important.  The read-only switch -cannot- prevent Tails from being altered.

I tried to update the wiki but I was told that "Error: download is locked and cannot be edited"

Best regards.
