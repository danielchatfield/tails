That suggestion seems only to copy the \"tails\" part, but not the persistent partition. I would like to have both copied.

My windows pc can't \"see\" the pendrive contents, otherwise I would simply have copied all the files on the pendrive from pendrive1 to pendrive2.

Go to top left: Applications-->System Tools-->Tails USB Installer

Clone & Install
