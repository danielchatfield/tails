>Unfortunately, I2P releases are usually done a few weeks after Firefox ESR releases.

Releases aren't timed as regularly as that =P I2P releases occur on roughly a five-to-six-week cycle, though that isn't set in stone (e.g. if the network starts encountering problems or a serious issue is discovered in a release, we'll push out an update sooner). But there is generally a week's notice before a release will go out, when the tags are frozen (so that translators have time to make updates), and this is always notified in the #i2p-dev channel topic (on Irc2P, and usually FreeNode/OFTC as well by the relay).
