Hmm??? You should learn to write and open a new thread instead of adding something with absolutely no matter with the first post. But to answer your questions, just: if you are not an advanced user, you should not try to do things as so complex that you don't understand them. At least, you should not take risks with your data. Now they are lost, this is your affair; read the documentation: TrueCrypt is not fully supported by Tails.

@OP: great! good tip, thanks.
