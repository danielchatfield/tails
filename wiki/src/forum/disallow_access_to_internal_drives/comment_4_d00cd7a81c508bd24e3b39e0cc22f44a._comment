Hi, I'm the OP.

Yes it is. This is why I recommend to blacklist both *ata_piix*
and *ahci*, and say that this list can be extended.

Some disks use the *ahci* module. If you are not sure, do as explained. If, despite the 'blacklist', you can access the internal drive, find the module that is used, and then you can post an addendum here.

If you don't trust this method, you can see on [Archlinux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_modules#Using_kernel_command_line_2).

As said in the initial post, this blacklisting method can be reverted by root (for ATA: modprobe ata_piix). But root can do what she wants. And obviously, if you are a buggy root, you can break your system.

Note that what I propose is just a plus. Several posts have been
sent on this forum to ask questions about access to internal drives (and how to forbid this). This is just a tip that can be
used from any Linux LiveUSB (not LiveCD or DVD, because CD/DVD
readers are internal - don't blacklist them in such a case!)
If you don't trust it, don't use it ;)
