when Tor starts, these are some of the notices which I only find in Tails, not TBB:

>We weren't able to find support for all of the TLS ciphersuites that we wanted to advertise. This won't hurt security, but it might make your Tor (if run as a client) more easy for censors to block.

>To correct this, use a more recent OpenSSL, built without disabling any secure ciphers or features.

>No AES engine found; using AES_* functions.

>This version of OpenSSL has a slow implementation of counter mode; not using it.

Those things don't sound good.
