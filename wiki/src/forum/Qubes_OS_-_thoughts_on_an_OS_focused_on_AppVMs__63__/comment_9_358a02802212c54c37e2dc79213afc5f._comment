>With my limited technical knowledge it appears that cubes uses a micro-kernel though very diferent from linux and debian correct me if I am wrong..So am I correct in thinking we will, unfortunately never see this in tails?

No Qubes is a Linux based distro (derived form Fedora if memory serves) which incorporates a pre-configured [Xen](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/xen/) based hypervisor \"host\" along with several ready made \"client\" profiles.

There's no particular magic to the packages in Qubes, the ingenuity is lies in the manner in which its components have been selected and \"glued\" together. Qubes is very much *like* Tails in this regard.

Some of the fundamentals for this sort of design are already in Tails, though mostly VM *client* tools rather than *host* ones. These client tools already make it simple to achieve a Qubes-like solution manually. You can (and many do) configure a system as a VM host under which they can then run any number virtual Tails (and/or Libert√© or whatever) instances. There are even *live distros* which incorporate pre-installed VM hosts. One of those could serve as a handy non-persistent host... the KNOPPIX DVD springs to mind.

Unfortunately, the more of these obscureish tools that find their way into tails, the greater the [mindless paranoia](https://tails.boum.org/forum/spice-vdagent:_what_the_heck_is_this_doing_installed__63__/) they'll [provoke](https://tails.boum.org/forum/ham_radio_modules/). A *minor* irritation I suppose but sadly not *completely* harmless.

I'm sure everyone would agree that there's much Tails could gain from this sort of virtualisation-for-abstraction-and-isolation. There's only one major obstacle that I can see - actually doing it.
