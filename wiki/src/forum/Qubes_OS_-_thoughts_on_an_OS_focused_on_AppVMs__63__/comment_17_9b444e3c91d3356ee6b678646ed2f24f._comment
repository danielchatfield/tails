OP here, a  little depressed that sexist commenters like #1 make me look like I'm Joanna.

I thought it would be nice to see a sandboxed workspace in Tails so anonymity networks and browsers could be sandboxed away from /home and the OS in general. I'm sure a port or something rudimentary could be made for Debian eventually.
