Here's what Tails developers have to say about its software: \"It helps you to use the Internet anonymously almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leave no trace using unless you ask it explicitly.\" (for more, read here: <https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html>)

As Qubes OS does not offer users to surf the internet anonymously, I don't see how Tails users will benefit from it.
