>As Qubes OS does not offer users to surf the internet anonymously, I don't see how Tails users will benefit from it.

Perhaps you should read the discussion then?

>The OP has posted something that is NOT related to Tails or even remotely connected to Tails's underlying principles.

Yes it is. There's *much* more to safeguarding privacy, anonymity and security than *\"use Tor\"*. This nascent thread, while somewhat naive, at least raises an interesting aspect of these wider \"underlying principles\" as demonstrated by the novel and interesting approach adopted by the Qubes developers.

>Moreover some of the replies to the OP are explicitly promoting the Qubes OS.

I wouldn't call any of this \"explicit promotion\" myself but what would be wrong with that anyway? Especially if the concepts/distro being \"explicitly promoted\" were of potential interest to Tails users. Qubes is free software too. The ideas and work involved in the Qubes OS, just like Tails, are *free*. They can and should be compared, discussed and *encouraged* to \"cross-pollinate\".

>In light of the above, could the admin/moderator delete the original post and all its threads?

I find this request rather depressing. Although Miss Rutkowska's self-promotion might be considered worthless, the rest of this thread *certainly* isn't.

PS. I am not the OP.
