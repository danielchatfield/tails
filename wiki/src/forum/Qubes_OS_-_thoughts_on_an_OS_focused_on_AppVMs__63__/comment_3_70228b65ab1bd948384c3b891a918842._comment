Qubes is certainly interesting. I find its \"disposable\" browser machine idea particularly relevant to Tails style use... when you launch the disposable browser, a non-persistent VM session is launched from a read-only profile. Being confined to that VM, wider pwnage is close to *impossible* and once that (even *totally pwned*) browser is closed, its VM is destroyed and the host OS and all other VMs continue in their pristine state - as if it had never even been launched in the first place. Like the ultimate sandbox really.

Of course Tails is based on Debian not Qubes.. and always will be... but there's certainly much to watch in Qubes.. possibly even potential ideas for the future of Tails?
