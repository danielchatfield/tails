It just isn't functioning for me, almost no eepsites will load (ever) and I had the exactly same problem running i2p on another OS on my LAN until I punched a hole in iptables and exposed that port (port forwarded through my router) externally.

I'm not comfortable with changing iptables settings on Tails to do this without knowing exactly what I'm doing to the rest of the firewall configuration in the process.

The i2p docs do say that, while it should work without doing expsoing that port, it will work much better if you do.
