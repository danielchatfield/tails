The [I2P FAQ](http://www.i2p2.de/faq.html#ports) reads: \"nothing needs to be reachable by unsolicited remote peers, but if you can configure your NAT/firewall to allow inbound UDP and TCP the outbound facing port, you'll get better performance\".

I doubt we want to punch such a hole in the Tails firewall merely for performance reasons.
