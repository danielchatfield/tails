Tor and Tails usage can be fingerprinted at two points:


    You <--1--> Tor Network <--2--> Destination

At point 1 an eavesdropper (e.g. your ISP) can see that you are connecting to the Tor network and hence (probably) is a Tor user. If you use a Tor bridge this becomes harder, especially if it's a non-public obfsproxy-enabled Tor bridge.

What can out you as a Tails user at point 1 is if Tails does anything special compared to a normal Tor user. Some things comes to mind:

* Tails doesn't allow any non-Tor traffic (well, there's I2P and the Unsafe Browser but let's ignore them for the sake of simplicity), which isn't the case for the vast majority of normal Tor users. If you're behind a NAT (i.e. you share your Internet connection with other computers that are generating innocent clearnet Internet traffic at the same time as you use Tails) this isn't a problem.

* Tails [[time syncing process|contribute/design/Time_syncing]] may suddenly restart Tor after it has bootstrapped (if your clock was very off) which may emit some distinct signature on network.

* Tails will query (using Tor) the [[security]] section of this website to see if it is up-to-date, and this is done pretty much immediately after Tor is up and running. Fetching that information over Tor right after a Tor bootstrap may be another distinct signature on the network. 

Full disclosure. ;) 

Point 2 was covered pretty good by comment 4, but it should be noted that an eavesdropper at that point will only learn that some Tor user is a Tails user, not that it is you specifically.
