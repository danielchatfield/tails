Thanks for the suggestions.  I hadn't thought of those possibilities, and agree that they make sense.

I am still worried by the strange connection Team Themis <--> Palantir <--> EFF <--> Tor Project, however.  I'd be much happier if I knew that the NGO is not tied to the U.S. Intelligence community, and these days it seems that almost any multinational corporation has \"diversified\" into privatized espionage, often targeting ordinary citizens.
