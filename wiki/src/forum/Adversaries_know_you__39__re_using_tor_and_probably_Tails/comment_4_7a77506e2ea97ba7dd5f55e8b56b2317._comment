>Hmm, so my ISP doesn't know I am using Tails, but the websites I access have a way of knowing.

Quite.

>If they have a way to tell the difference between real useragent information and useragent.override information, I'm assuming they're reading directly from the about:config information.

Not exactly... but as good as...

>If those parameters vary between different anonymity distros/browsers, an adversary has the ability to pin down what particular piece of software I am using to access a given website.

Yes, there are myriad ways to \"fingerprint\" browsers... from the blindingly obvious - UA, JS, installed plugins, etc, through page load timings, known exploits, plugin functionality/exploits, etc... all the way to \"social engineering\"... e.g. using rendering \"quirks\" to control user behaviour.

...and as you observed, the way in which these tells are \"sanitised\" could yield *further* information! :o(

The only way to achieve truly dependable \"spoofing\" would be to achieve 100% functional emulation of the target browser. Exploits and all! :-|

>This gives rise to the following question: let's say I download Tails or TBB or whatever using a computer in a politically repressive regime, let's say Iran. Since websites can see through useragent, etc spoofing, and if they can see you're running Tails or TBB, the next logical step in tracking down a dissident is to get the IP address of everyone who downloaded Tails over a period of say, 3 months or whatever. They'd then scan for IPs from Iran ISP and that'd be the end of the line. Oh, but they need a valid subpoena, you might say, but governments are very powerful. In the West it's usually the \"Terrorist activity\" card.

To paraphrase you slightly, this is probably all you needed to consider...

The logical step in tracking down a dissident is to get the IP address of everyone who downloaded Tails
