>I am not too troubled by the origins of Tor with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory

No. Having been FOSS for some time, that's ancient history now - assuming the US gov doesn't retain some hidden influence - but that concern is equally applicable to all other FOSS and much more applicable to all other (propitiatory) software.

>(I've seen documents I regard as somewhat credible suggesting that some of the original developers were distressed that Tor \"got away from them\" and is being used in ways they did not forsee).

Credible: no doubt. Credible *what* though? Remorse? Regret? Propaganda? FUD? Misinformation? Disinformation? Bluff? Double-bluff? Triple-bluff?... 

Unless you are the publisher (US gov) you can't know.

>I am much more troubled by the more recent sponsorship by an \"anonymous US NGO\". Why would that NGO wish to remain anonymous? If there is a possible innocuous reason, I'd like to hear it!

Really?

* If Tor is suddenly found to be a sham, the \"NGO\" won't be sullied.
* Free speech = terrorism. Funding terrorism could be considered imprudent.
* Free speech = sexual abuse of children. Funding sexual abuse of children could be considered imprudent.
* FOSS is **SOCIALIST**!!! :O
* FOSS is **COMMUNIST**!!! :O
* Some important donors may not approve of some aspect of the Tor project.
* Some important senators may not approve of some aspect of the Tor project.

The whole world is political, the US in particular is OUTSTANDINGLY bigoted. To exist in the US an organisation must conduct *potentially* contentious business with caution and discretion.
