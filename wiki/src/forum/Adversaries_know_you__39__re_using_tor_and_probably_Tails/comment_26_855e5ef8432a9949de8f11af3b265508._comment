I've noticed and worried about many of the subnetworks mentioned in that thread, and apparently I am not the only one to worry about the dominance of fast Tor nodes (or ones claiming to be fast) belonging to a tiny handful of operators.

Did you know that the formless networking nodes, mentioned in that thread, which are apparently operated by none other than Mike Perry, developer of Torbutton and EFF associate, were the subject of some pastebin posts a while back?  (Not by me, and I have no idea who the author was.)  Sorry I don't have a link but you can probably find it by searching for \"Mike Perry\" and \"pastebin\" and \"Applied Operations\" or something like that.

One of the CCC subnetworks also appear in that thread.  The CCC does some great work but some accuse it of sometimes working with the Dark Side--- currently I discount that because of their great work publicizing the DigiTask trojan.  (Americans can search out the US reseller of DigiTask malware and draw their own conclusions--- sorry I can't recall the company name right now.)

I am not too troubled by the origins of Tor with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (I've seen documents I regard as somewhat credible suggesting that some of the original developers were distressed that Tor \"got away from them\" and is being used in ways they did not forsee).  I am much more troubled by the more recent sponsorship by an \"anonymous US NGO\".  Why would that NGO wish to remain anonymous?  If there is a possible innocuous reason, I'd like to hear it!

I wonder how many other EFF members have been worried by the refusal of EFF to comment on the fact that one of the sponsor of their annual ball one or two years ago was Palantir Networks, which was involved in the notorious Team Themis?  Palantir was cofounded by a wealthy cofounder of Paypal who was the subject of a long New Yorker essay which suggested that person may harbor some convictions which I regard as cryptofascistic.
