Thanks for the prompt reply.

Hmm, so my ISP doesn't know I am using Tails, but the websites I access have a way of knowing. If they have a way to tell the difference between real useragent information and useragent.override information, I'm assuming they're reading directly from the about:config information. If those parameters vary between different anonymity distros/browsers, an adversary has the ability to pin down what particular piece of software I am using to access a given website.

This gives rise to the following question: let's say I download Tails or TBB or whatever using a computer in a politically repressive regime, let's say Iran. Since websites can see through useragent, etc spoofing, and if they can see you're running Tails or TBB, the next logical step in tracking down a dissident is to get the IP address of everyone who downloaded Tails over a period of say, 3 months or whatever. They'd then scan for IPs from Iran ISP and that'd be the end of the line. Oh, but they need a valid subpoena, you might say, but governments are very powerful. In the West it's usually the \"Terrorist activity\" card.
