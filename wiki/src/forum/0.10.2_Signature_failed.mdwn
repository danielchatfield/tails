I went through the instructions on the site using Linux with the command line. I am running Ubuntu 11.10, I downloaded Tails 0.10.2 as a bit torrent download. Now when the download finished the file came with Tails 0.10.2 iso and its own signature, but on the Torproject website when you click on torrent download as an option to download Tails it also has a tab to download the Tails 0.10.2 cryptographic signature which is a torrent signature. So I went ahead and verified the iso image using the command line on Ubuntu 11.10 with the first signature which came with the torrent download and it was a good signature. So then I went ahead and did the same with the signature provided by Torproject website and it came back as a bad signature. Should I go ahead and use Tails or not?
