> If I use TOR running within a Tails operating system loaded on a USB plugged into my PC at home, and ONLY VIEW documents and images (NO downloading!), am I leaving ANY trace of my viewing on my home PC?

No. Tails is amnesic by default.

By the way, please ask one question per thread only.

The OP was replied, so this thread is now closed.
