<blockquote><p>To mention just one problem which was apparently overlooked into it was disclosed in this forum, regardless of whether you boot Tails from a USB or a live DVD, this leaves a trace in your other OS (the one installed on your hard drive) that you inserted a DVD or USB stick with a specific unique identifier at a specific time, and then shutdown your other OS. Even worse, the traces may well specify that your USB stick is called \"Tails\".</p></blockquote>

That would be true only if you first started your other os before loading up tails.
