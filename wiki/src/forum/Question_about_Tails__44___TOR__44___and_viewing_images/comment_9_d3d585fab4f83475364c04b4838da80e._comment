@8: Or if you inserted the Tails DVD or USB before shutting-down the other OS.

It has been noted before on this forum that the *possibility* exists for a remote attacker to gain access to your hard drive (or any other attached volumes, even if not mounted). (Whether you are running Tails or any other OS-- as long as you are connected to the Internet).

But by that point, having the mere fact that you use Tails revealed would probably be the *least* of your concerns.
