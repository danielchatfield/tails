So there's no need for Greasemonkey and the HTML5 script anymore.

The only problem is Noscript now, adding youtube.com and ytimg.com to whitelist isn't enough. You should also uncheck this option:

**Apply these restrictions to whitelisted sites too**

After that videos will be automatically started. Is it safe using Noscript this way? There's only a few whitelisted websites.

What will be the Noscript options in the next Tails release?
