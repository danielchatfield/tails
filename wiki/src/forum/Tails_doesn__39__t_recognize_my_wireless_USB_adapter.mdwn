Pretty much what the title says.

I can't get an internet connection on Tails because the wireless USB adapter isn't recognized. When I click on "Network Connections" in Tails, I only have the option for Wired Network or VPN. Wireless isn't even mentioned.

I'm using a Netgear N300 Wireless Adapter - to make it work for Windows I had to run the install disk it came with - will I have to do this for Tails? I certainly hope not.

Thanks in advance for the help.
