Yes, please don't discontinue this forum!

Allowing users of Tails to interact anonymously in Tails discussions and to sometimes receive invaluable feedback from the developers is invaluable!  One of the biggest current problems with your (spiritual) \"parent\", The Tor Project, is the lack of anonymous bug reports and feedback modes.

Thanks also for whisperback.
