> decrypting/encrypting with gedit you can't paste in your keys

I assume you mean \"passphrase\" instead of \"key\". I think you can paste it that way (untested):

 1. just select your passphrase with the mouse; from now on, don't select any other text
 2. ask decryption to the gpgApplet or Gedit
 3. in seahorse prompt for passphrase, use *middle* mouse click to paste.

Works?
