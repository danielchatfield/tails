I also am interested in the way Tails communicates with external net connection (wifi - ether - cell) and in this way IS related to Tails. This forum IS just the place to ask this question and IS the future. Any one else having success? Please let us know. ps - Be wary of those who tell you that YOURS' is not a question to be asked here; they're the same ones who promised to fix the Forum 2 years ago. Same ol' pos since 0.05
