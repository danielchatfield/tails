I hope there is a medal for that. But seriously, hold your breaths.

Few that I know, Tor exit nodes can see plain text traffic and orginal IP address, so that leaves users in a choice to either trust exit nodes or trust thier ISP's to begin with (open surfing). Given this understanding what add value does Tor supply in terms of anonimity?

**I have read the manual and the written above is to the best of my knowledge**

Peace!
