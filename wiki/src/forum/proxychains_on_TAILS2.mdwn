I want to connect web like below.

me > Tor network > proxy server > web

I do "sudo apt-get install proxychains"
then
"nano /etc/proxychains.conf"
but it opens new blank file. What is wrong? Why doesnt it open file with lines where I just add something like socks4 127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 ip.address.here port... ?

Please give me clear and complete answer, I dont want waste your time any more. Thanks.
