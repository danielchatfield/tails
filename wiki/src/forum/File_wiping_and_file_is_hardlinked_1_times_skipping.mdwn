While wiping files I got an error window that said:

    Wipe failed.
    
    Error: File [path/filename.ext] - file is hardlinked 1 time(s) skipping!
    
    \/ Details
    Subprocess failed.
    Error: File [path/filename.ext] - file is hardlinked 1 time(s) skipping!
    
    [Close]

The work around I found was to rename the files, even as little as altering one character, would allow it to be wiped.  Is there a security risk in renaming the files before wiping them and why does the hardlinked error occure?
