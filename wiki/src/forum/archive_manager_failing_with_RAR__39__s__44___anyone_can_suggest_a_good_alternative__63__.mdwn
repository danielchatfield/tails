I'm having trouble with several split (non-passworded) rar files.

although the help file of the incuded archiver program suggests that rar files are supported, it does not want to open them and does not show them under "all archives" when selecting "open".

anyone have any suuggestions for lightweight/simple alternatives that work more reliably?

thanks
