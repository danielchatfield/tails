I've been trying TAILS for a few weeks, and it's great !

From what I understand, Tor has created a custom version of firefox with a few important patches to enhance anonimity : https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/

On the other hand, TAILS seems to provide a standard version of iceweasel, carefully pre-configured, but apparently without the patches they mention in that link.

Am I missing something ? Is there a reason for using iceweasel instead of torbrowser ?
