Hello,

I created my first bootable Tails USB drive today. It works as advertised, but I assumed that I'd be able to plug that USB drive into a Windows system and be able to access the files contained within.

Did I expect too much? Regardless of whether it is advisable, is it possible?

What mechanism is keeping the Windows system from recognizing the drive when I plug it in?

Thanks,

-Leo
