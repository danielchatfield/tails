> Addons are lost after reboot from the usb. How to remain permanently in the new iceweasel addons?

Tails is a [Live system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_cd) so all filesystem changes are lost after a reboot. We will allow certain stuff to stay once we have [[todo/persistence]] in place, but Iceweasel addons are likely not something we'll allow keeping -- messing with them can easily screw up Tails' Iceweasel setup.
