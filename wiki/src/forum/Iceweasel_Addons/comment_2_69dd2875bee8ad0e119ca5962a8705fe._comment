Setup an encryp[ted partition or usbstick with say cryptsetup LUKS.

Install your plugins and bookmarks, whatever. Quit Iceweasel.

1. Copy the ~/.mozilla directory to your encrypted partition. This will contain any plugins etc.

2. Delete ~/.mozilla

3. Place a symlink to the .mozilla directory on your encrypted drive in /home/amnesia

4. Restart Iceweasel.

When you shutdown tails, your bookmarks, addons etc are now stored on your encrypted drive instead of vanishing intop thin air.

On booting up Tails next time, mount your encrypted partition, quit Iceweasel and repeat steps 2-4.
