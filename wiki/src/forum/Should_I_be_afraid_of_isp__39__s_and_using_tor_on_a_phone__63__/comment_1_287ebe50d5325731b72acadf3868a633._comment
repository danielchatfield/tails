Also I've been worried about mac addresses I've been hearing about. I worry about my privacy I guess too much because I think that somehow they know the devices I have and when they travel with me and connect to a friends house then they know its me and that I've been with that friend on their internet. I don't know if that's true but that's why I worry about my mac address. Is that something to worry about to I guess? What is a mac address I guess anyways too. I've tried researching it on wiki but again its just really hard to understand and its not as simple as a definition. I want to know what it does and why it should concern me not the details of it and what it looks like and its history. Can someone also help me know why or if I should be concerned about mac addresses and all that I guess too?
