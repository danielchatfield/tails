ISP = internet service provider, the one who lets you connect to the internet, who you usually pay a monthly fee to. 
This company sees about everything you do online, unless you use encrypted connections, as TAILS/TOR do by default, and/or https:// . In these cases they'll just see gibberish. 
They may see that you're connecting to the TOR network if you're using a known entrance node or at least can assume it since all your traffic will be encrypted (if you're using an anonymous tor-bridge-node). 

If you have to be careful showing to an ISP that you're using tor/tails or not is a mere question of paranoia really. 
The ISP earn their money with your monthly fees and they're glad to keep you a customer, really. As long as they're not enforced by law, they usually won't give your information out.

I basically agree with previous poster. As long as you don't do anything illegal, you don't have to worry about anything really, and can tell people, if you really want to give them an answer, that you're doing it for your privacy, because you dont want facebook, google analytics or whoever track your private moves on the internet, because you yourself don't track anyone either and want to keep your freedom.


MAC-Address = a worldwide unique hardware adress of your network card, wireless card, etc etc. Harddrives and other hardware may have unique addresses too. 

If you bought your hardware online, a serial number is likely connected to your purchase, therefor offering at least the Vendor the information of device=probable user. 
There always is a risk and often have been problems with databases of vendors or any firm, being it your credit card company/bank, etc been hacked and leaked onto the internet.
So i say, the MAC-Adress as i understand it would usually not be transmitted or leaked out to the websites you visit while using tor/tails, but when it would do, there is a possibility that you, the buyer is connected to his/her device somewhere!
