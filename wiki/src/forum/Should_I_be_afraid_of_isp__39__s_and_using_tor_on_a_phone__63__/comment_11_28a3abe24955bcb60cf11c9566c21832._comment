be more concerned over TEMPEST attacks.

Google: cryptome tor opsec

read the tor opsec article from start to finish.

consider: 

power line vulnerabilities giving away keys pressed,
(run tor on laptop battery not connected to power outlet, especially when entering truecrypt password(s), local user passwords, remote passwords, sites visited, etc. use on screen keyboard if you're plugged into a powerline, make a list of sites you frequently visit, enter them into a text file and copy paste them into address bar)

key presses duplicated a room or more away (even with a wired keyboard)

traffic matching

laser microphone attacks against your windows

binocular/telescope attacks peering into your computer lab, if they can't see your screen they can check reflections on objects in your surroundings, especially if you have a large TV screen which is OFF, mirrors on the wall, anything shiny like silver

so many other attacks, especially if someone can enter your computer lab without you knowing and black bagging your system by rooting/pwning it and/or placing video/audio bugs

so much more to be concerned about
