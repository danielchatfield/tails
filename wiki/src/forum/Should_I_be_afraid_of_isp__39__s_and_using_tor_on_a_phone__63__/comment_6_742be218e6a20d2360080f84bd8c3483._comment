The best thing you can do is, use a trusted non-logging VPN provider, here is a list: <https://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/>

I'll suggest Mullvad. You can pay via Bitcoin or cash or Paypal.

This way network admins and ISPs cannot see you are a Tor user, just a VPN user. If you want more protection, you can use a bridge and better a obfsproxy bridge while connecting to Tor on top of the VPN, but that would slower in most cases.
