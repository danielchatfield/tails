I just bumped it manually. You can do that by clicking the \"edit\" link that appears when you move the mouse next to that wrench at the top of the page. You don't have to edit the first post just add a description such as \"bump\". This appears in the edit history and recent changes. If you edit Wikipedia this ikiwiki software is similar. Curses be upon anywhoo would use this awsome power I give unto you, for reasons such as wanting more attention than is deserved.
