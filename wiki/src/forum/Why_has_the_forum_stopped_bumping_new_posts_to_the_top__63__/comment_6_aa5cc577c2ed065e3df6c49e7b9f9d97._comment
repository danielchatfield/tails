preferably one which allows registered users to down-vote FUD and Trolling or marking them as such but still such comments being available to the users who want to see them to avoid censorship claims. A bit like youtube comments I guess. \"this comments has received too many negative votes (show comment)\" but if you make such option available to all I fear the trolls will take advantage of it and you wont be able to keep the forum from chaos anymore. So please when the new forum appears, make it count.

PS: OSQA apears to be confusing to use however, or at least to be difficult to use for public discussions on tails issues as the voting thing gets ahead of the time for sorting comments though. But have not used it yet so.. my claims are not exactly fundamented on experience.
