Hi Alessandro,

My word - what an angel you are.  I am really grateful to you for the unselfish way you gave up some of your time to post the detailed help for me (and no doubt others) that helped me sort my problem.

Your solution worked - I was very anxious to attempt this - but your guidance was perfect and I followed it step by step and ended up with a massive amout of retrieved files - even ones I though I had deleted and many fracments.

However, after searching through the many retrieved files I eventually found my important documents.  I have now backed then up and backed them up again.

I am extremely grateful and appreciative of help.

Thank You

Sandy
