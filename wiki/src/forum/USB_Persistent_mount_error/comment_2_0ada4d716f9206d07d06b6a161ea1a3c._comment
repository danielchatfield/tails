@1: I'm not sure what you're missing. \"Sandy\" only seems to have omitted his UUIDs - which seems fair enough.

From the description it seems that \"Sandy\" may have corrupted the superblock. Perhaps by prematurely withdrawing his stick.

>Also if I use the check file system/repair it tells me the File System is NOT clean - left it running for ages (3 hours) and nothing.

Which tool was that? How did you invoke it? What output does it give? (Was this the info you were missing comment 1?)
