Thank you for your replies.  I fear I have lost some extremely important documents - most other documents can be retrieved elsewhere - but a few crucial ones cannot unless I can somwhow get the persistent volume to load and copy the documents.

Anyway - I posted the error message - I just left out the number/id strings which I thought were meaningless.  For example: \"uuid-2e6000a3-97f5-4598-ba9a-541189a3ef08-uid1000 is write-protected\"

Anyway - I was using the Disk Utility that comes with TAIL (Applications - System Tools - Disk Utility) - I selected the USB and saw the 30Gb Encrypted Partition - used the unlock voulme - entered passphrase - it opened - I then selected the newly shown 30GB TailsData volume and hit the check filesystem option - which should check and repair - it was this that hang for 3 hours and reported that the volume NOT Clean - no other information.

Please help - getting desparate and despairing now!!

Do you think if I tried to install an older version of TAILS (previous) it will help sort this out?

I have tried the USB in three different computers - all the same probelm.

I suspect a 'superblock' corruption maybe a cause - certainly I never pulled the USB out wrongly before the error - if it is a bad sector effecting the header info needed to mount the voulume is there any repair for this eventuality?

Is there a way via the filesystem (given the volume will not mount) were I could access the volume - with passphrase?

I am not an expert - so am not that familar with terminal commands - but have used terminal on another system as sudo - however, if there is anyway via terminal that you know - please treat me as a idiot and tell me step by step the commands.


Lstly - I did read somewhere that I could try a back-up the volume (make a copy) BLOCK BY BLOCK - how the hell do you do that?  I assume by copying you can try and repair/open it on another system - such as Ubuntu or Mint.

Many Thanks

Sandy
