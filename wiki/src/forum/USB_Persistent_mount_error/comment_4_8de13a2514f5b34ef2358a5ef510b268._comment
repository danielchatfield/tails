You can try this method to recover your files: unlock the partition (as you already did) then run a disk recovery tool on it.

Here's the step-by-step howto:

1. Start Tails. Be sure to set a root password in the greeter;
2. Connect to Internet
3. Open a terminal
4. Run \"sudo apt-get update\" and wait while downloading package lists
5. Run \"sudo apt-get install testdisk\"
6. Use the Gnome Disk Manager to unlock the encrypted partition. Then click on the \"TailsData\" block and look at the value of the \"device\" attribute in the description. It will probably be /dev/dm-0
7. From Nautilus, mount a partition on your HDD, or an external HDD, or some other media. You will put recovered file here;
8. In a terminal, run \"sudo photorec\"
9. Select the /dev/dm-0 device, or whatever you found on step 6
10. Select \"non-partitioned\"
11. Select the \"TailsData\" partition. Before hitting \"enter\", you can go to the \"File Opt\" entry on the bottom to restrict search to some specific file types
12. Select ext2/ext3 as filsystem
13. Select to scan the whole disk
14. Select a folder in the HDD you mounted before. To reach it, select \"..\" twice, then \"/media\", then the name of the disk (as it appears in Nautilus - for example, \"sandy\"), then, if you want, some subfolder. When you're ok press Y
15. Search should start, wait for it to finish. It will take minutes (possibly a lot of minutes)
16. In the folder you selected (let's say it was /media/sandy, without subfolders), there will be a number of new \"recup_dir.N\" subfolders, with N counting from 1 up. You still can't open them because of permissions
17. In a terminal, run \"sudo chmod -R 777 /media/sandy/recup_dir.*\" to fix permissions (replace /media/sandy with the actual path you used!!!)
18. Now you can browse the \"recup_dir.N\" folders. If you're lucky, your documents are there (together with lots of useless file fragments)

Hope you solve your problem!
