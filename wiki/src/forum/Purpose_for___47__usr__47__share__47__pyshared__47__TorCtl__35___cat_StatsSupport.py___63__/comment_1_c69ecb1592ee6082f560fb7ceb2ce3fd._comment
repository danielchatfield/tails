> what is the purpose of this file in Tails?

If you're curious about technical details, then please learn the technical basics about the OS, e.g. `dpkg -S`.
Then, you'll learn that this file is shipped by the `python-torctl` package, that is installed as a dependency for the `tor-arm` package, and perhaps that will be a bit less of a OMG time that needs to be shared on this forum.
