1.a Probably (NB: \"pagefile\" and \"hiberfile\")

1.b.i (Probably) Boot into a real OS, shred the \"pagefile\" and \"hiberfile\" files, then securely erase free space.

1.b.ii (Certainly) Destroy the HD

2\. Probably a VM network config problem. Does the \"unsafe browser\" work? Please explicitly describe \"does not work\".

3\. A nebulous \"more secure\" does not mean anything. Secure against *what*? e.g. Booting Tails on bare metal is less likely to leave traces of the session on the machine (no swap, proper memory wiping, etc) and will not be exposed to the keyloggers viruses and other crap infecting your (windows) host... however, if you managed to get your Tails session pwned, being sandboxed inside a VM could make it *more* difficult for your adversary to compromise your system (access your other OS's data, install rootkits, whatever)
