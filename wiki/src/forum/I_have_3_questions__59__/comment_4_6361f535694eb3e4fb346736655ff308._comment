not-op

regarding the answer to question 3 (and the others I guess)
Would the most secure option of all be getting rid of windows, installing qubes, running multiple tails from qubes in a vm for each contextual identity?
Or would the tails session still leave traces on the qubes os? Never tried qubes, just curious about the synergy here..
