Someone's output includes \"Users/II/AppData/Roaming/gnupg/pubring.gpg\"

Not a Windows or smart phone user, so that is new to me and I don't know what that means,  But if you are think you might be keeping your keyring \"in the cloud\", or letting a server you don't own perform your crypto processing for you (e.g. if you are using a Google service), I'd urge you to think again since this (probably) entirely defeats the point of using Tor even if your goal is simply to evade being profiled by data brokers who sell your browsing habits and other personal information to electronic marketeers and maybe criminals.

Random scary intelligence: in another thread here, someone mentioned \"stalking\" when he meant \"data brokerage\", but see the recent ITG news article on Paterna's Maltego software, which does things like search out photos from facebook pages and examine the metadata for information about who took the photograph and where.  Nothing one could not do \"by hand\", I think, but automation makes it trivial to do this for EVERYONE you are curious about for any reason.

Perfect for the 21st century stalker.

My point, picking up a point from another thread here: posting personal information to sites like Facebook is really foolish.  Same goes for job sites but that might be much harder to avoid.
