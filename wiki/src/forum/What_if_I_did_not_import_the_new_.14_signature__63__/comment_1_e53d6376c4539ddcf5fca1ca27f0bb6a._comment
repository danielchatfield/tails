You need to use gpg to import a particular GPG key.

THEN you use the detached signature to verify the iso image.

The three files are all available at 
https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#index3h1

Suppose you saved the files as tails.key, tails.sig, and tails.iso

If you are using almost any modern linux distribution, you should have GPG installed already because it is a standard component.  Then

gpg --import tails.key

will import the key.  You should see a message saying that one key was processed, unless you already imported the key. Then

gpg --verify tails,sig tails.iso

will verify the iso image.  You should see a message saying good signature and (probably) warning that the key is untrusted.

Optionally:  you can also check the certificate of the tails.boum.org site and save it for comparision with later visits.  You can try visiting tails.boum.org using another computer and check that you get the same certificate.   This provides some confidence that you obtained the three files from the genuine Tails site.  The most critical is the signing key, so you can look up tails and amnesia in a key server and look for the tails-signing key which you can download,save as tails.key2 and then try to import.  If GPG finds that key has already been imported, that is an indication that you have the genuine key.

Any individual verification effort can possibly be subverted by a highly sophisticated global adversary, but mixing several independent methods makes this almost impossible.  I think.
