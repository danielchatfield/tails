Thanks for the comments, but I'm still confused.

For Windows using Gpg4win

After installing Gpg4win, download Tails signing key:

Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import it [I didn't do this again but did it for 0.13. Is that one still valid?]

I used this command

C:\Users\YourUserName>gpg --verify c:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\tails-i386-0.14~rc1.iso.pgp c:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\tails-i386-0.14~rc1.iso

And got this result

gpg: Signature made 10/09/12 15:58:59 Pacific Daylight Time using RSA key ID BE2 CD9C1 gpg: Good signature from \"Tails developers (signing key) tails@boum.org\"

Is that good and one even though I never imported the new key? I'm asking because \"Tails\" commented it would be necessary reimport it. Did I misunderstand that?
