I use Linux, not Windows, but GPG should work the same way.

Suppose you named the three files tails.key (the Tails signing key you will use to verify the signature), tails.sig (the detached signature you will use to verify the authenticity of the iso image), tails.iso (the iso image you will burn to DVD).

Try typing in the Windows equivalent of a linux konsole (shell):

gpg --fingerprint BE2CD9C1

If you see \"expired\", there is a more recent version of the same key with a later expiration date, so try again to find that key at a keyserver and try importing the more recent version with

gpg --import tails.key

Then try

gpg --verify tails.sig tails.iso

Hope that is clear.  

It's hard to write documentation which clarifies the distinctions between the signing key, the detached sigature, and the file being signed.   The Tails documentation does just about the best job I've seen yet, but I guess it could use some further tweaks.

I like to call an identifier like BE2CD9C1 the \"key identifier\" and to stress that this is just an abbreviation (last two groups) of the \"fingerprint\" of the key.  Also, we are talking about the public key, one half of a keypair.  The private key (or secret key) must be kept secret by the Tails developers.  In case it were ever compromised, they should have generated a \"revocation certificate\" which can be used to send an authenticated message to the keyservers alerting everyone that the key is no longer valid.  The revocation certificate must also be kept very secret, probably by keeping it offline until it is needed.
