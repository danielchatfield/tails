>There is probably a daemon running that accesses the CD every second, to stop it spinning down.

For such a distro, there's no room for a \"probably.\"

Which daemon would this be?

Tails as a LiveCD *does* stop spinning after awhile, you can hear it spin up again as the drive comes to life if there's enough reason for it. One, for example, is when I access a few dozen tabs of SSL encrypted pages. Otherwise, it happily winds down and I don't hear the drive spinning the disc at all.

So let's begin again, without the word \"probably\" or blindly trusting in developers who must be wizards and they know it all so why should we explain behavior? Especially when iotop and top reveal nothing happening despite this drive light activity and a disc which is not spinning?
