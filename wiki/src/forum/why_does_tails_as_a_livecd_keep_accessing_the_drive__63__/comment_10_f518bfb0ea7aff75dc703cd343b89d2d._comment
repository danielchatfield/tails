OP, I've found a highly likely cause for your problem:

\"I'd worry about a Tempest virus that polled a personal computer's CD-ROM drive to pulse the motor as a signalling method:

* Modern high-speed CD-ROM drive motors are both acoustically and electrically noisy, giving you two attack methods for the price of one;

* Laptop computer users without CRTs, and the PC users that can afford large LCD screens instead of CRTs, often have CD-ROM drives;

* Users are getting quite used to sitting patiently while their CD-ROM drives grind away for no visibly obvious reason (but that's quite enough about the widespread installs of software from Microsoft CD-ROMs that prompted Kuhn's investigation in the first place.)
