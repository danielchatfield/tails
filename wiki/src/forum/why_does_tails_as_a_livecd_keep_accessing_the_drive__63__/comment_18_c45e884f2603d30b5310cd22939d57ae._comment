Let me try to bring this thread back to the goal of providing information/advice which may be valuable for many Tails users.

\"Tails\" can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that when you are using a live CD or DVD, when you first boot up you must expect heavy use of the drive because your PC/laptop is reading essential programs into RAM.  Later, if you start up some program not loaded into RAM, it will have to access the drive again in order to load that program into RAM.  Same thing if some program starts automatically (which can happen legitimately). 

So, period accesses of the CD drive are probably not unusual. If your PC/laptop is constantly accessing the drive, at a guess one explanation might be that you have too little RAM to comfortably operate a Tails system.  If you have 1GM or more, that is probably not the problem.

I don't know what could be causing the disk activity you reported, but from what has been said so far, I don't think it is neccessarily nefarious.

But learning about the file system organization of Debian stable systems, and software associated with the principle components of the gnome desktop environment and other elements of Debian stable, can help you to understand what should be normal behavior in a Tails system (because Tails is based on Debian stable).
