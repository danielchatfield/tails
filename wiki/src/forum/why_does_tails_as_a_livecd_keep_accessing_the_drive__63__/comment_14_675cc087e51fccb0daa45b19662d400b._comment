>Comment 10?! It means nothing all by its self.

Reverse psych. Denial. Misdirection.

This forum isn't the only thing that's pathetic.

Comment 10 is true for anyone with an ounce of wisdom, but cointelpro informants love to use misdirection, denial, and other tools to keep you from learning the truth. Just try and find serious discussions on the net about Tempest and Tempest malware, you won't because the few people who post about it have their posts moved, usually after they are mocked, to the bottom of the pile.

Any responses and defense for said postings are also moved and mocked further. They can't get the message, so they try and get the man. Pathetic.
