>>Comment 10?! It means nothing all by its self.

>Reverse psych. Denial. Misdirection.

>This forum isn't the only thing that's pathetic.

No. Indeed not. Some of the conspiracy theorists are *even more* primitive.

>Comment 10 is true for anyone with an ounce of wisdom

Of course it is! True *what* though? True paranoia? True FUD? True DoS? True naivety? True \"cointelpro\" (as you seem to have taken to saying lately)? True spam? True misdirection? True autism?...

It was an interesting idea, *in its original context* and when it was *originally* posited - **five years ago**!.. but why has it suddenly re-appeared here?... and why has poor Bruce Schneier suffered [the same spamming](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/friday_squid_bl_357.html#c1052218)? Who can know? I *certainly* don't.

>tools to keep you from learning the truth.

Ah! There it is... oooh scary. So you're one of us eh? A \"benevolent elder\" planting little shoots of FUD in the hope something will strike root? Well it's working like a charm on me! As I'm sure you can tell. You must feel filled with a warm glow of national service. I'm so scared shitless that I'm going to retreat to the safety of Windows and its NSA_KEYs!

Is the NSA taking psychology tips from Microsoft marketing?

>Just try and find serious discussions on the net about Tempest and Tempest malware

Why? I'm not someone who'd be interested in vague paranoia. I've better things to do with my time than trawl the 'net seeking out crackpots.

>you won't because the few people who post about it have their posts moved, usually after they are mocked, to the bottom of the pile.

Wrong. I won't because I won't try... even though I'm certain there are plenty of them out there... I've no interest in morons... but they are certainly trying to infiltrate the Tails forum and foist it upon us. It doesn't belong here. Please piss off back to usenet or wherever you've crawled out from.

>Any responses and defense for said postings are also moved and mocked further. They can't get the message, so they try and get the man. Pathetic.

There doesn't seem to be any \"message\" as such. Perhaps an ongoing, incompetent and utterly transparent campaign to subliminally sow FUD... or some delusional conspiricy theorist trawling the web for ancient stuff he doesn't understand and then spewing it up again here... but certainly nothing of any value. No message. Ho hum. More of the same. Blah blah blah... PLEASE STOP!

No doubt you're program/condition will have you keep this prodding up until someone's taken the trouble to pick through your **obsolete and O/T** *comment 10* - at which point you'll drop the next half-arsed \"FUD meme\" or whatever it is from your list into our forum.

Well, it's a dirty, pointless and no doubt thankless chore which, unsurprisingly, no one else has bothered to touch... but may as well get on with it I suppose...

>OP, I've found a highly likely cause for your problem:

**Highly likely**? Really? This happens a lot then does it? **References please**

>\"I'd worry about a Tempest virus that polled a personal computer's CD-ROM drive to pulse the motor as a signalling method:

A \"Tempest virus\" eh? Gosh! That sounds scary!.. 
Of course, if such things are *actually* being used (rather living only in the imagination of Dr A), they *will* be known, so... **References please**

Purely hypothetically though... If you were writing a Tempest viruse you'd choose to tap out a signal on an optical drive motor?! Of all the myriad circuits at your disposal in a modern device - WiFi, bluetooth, fans, CPUs, GPUs, LCDs, speakers, etc. - the signalling of choice of the Tempest virus *you're* imagining would be an optical drive? You know - that thing with the flashing light to alert it's owner to activity - hardly the stealthiest choice is it? Did you receive your training at The Mr Bean School of Espionage?

>Modern high-speed CD-ROM drive motors are both acoustically and electrically noisy, giving you two attack methods for the price of one;

Actually, crappy old slow clunky optical drives were noisier (electrically, electromagnetically and acoustically) than the modern ones... but then the post you've spammed us with **is five years old**! So I suppose the old crappy slow ones were \"modern and high-speed\" then!

>Laptop computer users without CRTs, and the PC users that can afford large LCD screens instead of CRTs, often have CD-ROM drives;

No they don't. With the trend for thinner and thinner laptops/notebooks/netbooks fewer and fewer users have optical drives. Oh, wait, **this is five years out of date** isn't it? Contemporary machines tend to have WiFi, bluetooth, fans, CPUs, GPUs, LCDs, speakers, etc... though! Lots of great signalling potential there! Oh yeah, LCDs! Around the time that ancient email wondering about CD-ROM signalling was sent, Dr.s Anderson & Kuhn published their seminal paper on LCD emanations... but then you know that, don't you?.. was that supposed to be this point of this re-post? Plant the idea that optical drives could substitute for CRTs as LCDs have replaced them... When you know already that LCDs produce clearer signals than CRTs ever did... Then you just happen to drop [that info elsewhere](https://tails.boum.org/forum/TEMPEST_Attacks__33___LCD_Monitor_leaks_system_noise_to_FRS/) as a second prong to the FUD? Coincidence? Or were we supposed to think \"oh, that's OK, I can boot from USB instead of CD\" only to find that thread... \"OMG! 'They' are listening via my LCD!!!\"? Two attacks for the price of one? Didn't you just quote that? Irony too?! You must be some sort of genius! What's your IQ? 109?

>Users are getting quite used to sitting patiently while their CD-ROM drives grind away for no visibly obvious reason (but that's quite enough about the widespread installs of software from Microsoft CD-ROMs that prompted Kuhn's investigation in the first place.)

I think this was originally proposed (five years ago) in the context of manipulating signals from a CD drive during a long-winded software installation to transmit the serial number you'd fed to the installer to the Microsoft van listening outside. The \"tempest virus\" would be the installer, the disk would be **busy** for a prolonged period (the installation of Office or Win 98) so able to \"transmit\" data covertly, and the payload would be tiny - a serial number. Not a ridiculous idea FOR THE PURPOSE and AT THE TIME!

Not relevant or interesting here and now though.

There. The drain's unblocked again. Hopefully the crap can quietly disappear without stinking the place out now. For a while at least.

Are you the G man trying to spook us?

Or are you *really* just a whining brat? 

And what does crap like `The UK occupies an odd position in the \"Space Race\"...` have to do with Tails either?

Oh, and why [the heinous assault on poor Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/friday_squid_bl_357.html#c1052218)?

Answers in ten words or less. Thanks.

Sincere apologies to whichever dev drew the short straw and got to look this over. Is there any way you could \"lock\" these threads, once they've run their useful(ish) course (as this one did somewhere between comment 1 and comment 9). Could something as simple as a template without the \"Add comment\" link be enough to drastically reduce the crap?
