>Tails as a LiveCD does stop spinning after awhile, you can hear it spin up again as the drive comes to life if there's enough reason for it. One, for example, is when I access a few dozen tabs of SSL encrypted pages. Otherwise, it happily winds down and I don't hear the drive spinning the disc at all.

Yep, my LiveDVD does stop spinning too, after awhile.
