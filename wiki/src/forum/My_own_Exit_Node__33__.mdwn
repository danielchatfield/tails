Hi All,

I need to have an exit node which is of a specific country, for example Australia or USA. 
Reason being im trying to post some ads on a sales board and it wont allow me to post in for example Sydney, Australia yet have an IP which is originating from Washington, USA.

I have tried the Socks5 method but apparently that does not change your exit node. 
Iv looked through etc/tor/Torrc file yet dont know how to play around wiht it to specify a desired exit node!

Anyone be able to point me in the right direction please!

Thanks.
