Ok. I saw another thread here of someone asking how to install madwifi. Since I think this would be a proper solution to this problem, I also have the same question.

I dont think reporting a bug would be a good idea for me since:

1. It reveals much more information about my hardware than directly connected to the issue which I think would risk my anonymity. Its too much to disclose.

2. Reporting the bug from Tails 0.15 AFTER applying the workaround wouldn't show the malfunction. Everything appears to be fine.

3. I've considered the email option, but I don't know of any free email website that would guarantee email account privacy (i.e. no logs). A suggestion in this regard would be appreciated.

I am almost certain that the issue is with the wireless card's driver, therefore I want to give madwifi package a try, but I don't know how to install it on Tails. Help please!

I've also noticed that changing mac through Macchanger would render the workaround useless, No idea why.
