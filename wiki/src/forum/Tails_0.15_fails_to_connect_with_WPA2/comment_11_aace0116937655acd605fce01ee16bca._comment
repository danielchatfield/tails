I understand that the phrase \"third party\" ticks off some debian extremists around here :)

I do however understand why Tails devs strictly abide with Debian and that they're doing so for the right technical reasons (in their view).

Tor for instance which is the core of Tails is in fact a third party software and cannot be identified as a Debian package.

Furthermore Tails by design is user customizable/tweakable to meet individual needs and words like \"You can do this or that at your own risk\" were thrown around by Tails reps numerous times. If madwifi cant be intigrated into Tails, why not make the package available and leave installation as a user's choice while not maintaining any guarantees ( +1 on personal responsibility policy ).
