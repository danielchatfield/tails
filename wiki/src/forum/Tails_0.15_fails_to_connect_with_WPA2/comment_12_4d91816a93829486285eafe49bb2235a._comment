For what it's worth, there **is** a [package for Tor in Debian](http://packages.debian.org/tor>),
and I absolutely don't consider it as *third-party*. Tails currently pulls Tor from the Tor project APT repository, rather than from Debian, though.

Well, because... to the best of my knowledge, this package does not exist.
