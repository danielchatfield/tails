Thanks for your help anyhow. I beg to differ on \"third party\" thingie. Tails come with multiple third party stuff, I dont see why integrating madwifi is any different if thats a better solution for multiple hardware.

That aside, I have devaloped the workaround I posted earlier to make it support mac changing, just add the following lines thereafter: 

macchanger [Desired parameter] wlan0  
rfkill block all
rfkill unblock all

To know list of macchanger parameters type this before: macchanger --help

Problem solved for me with this fix. I really hope this to be looked into in the next Tails edition/version, hopefully adding madwifi as part of the whole package.
