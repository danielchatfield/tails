> Does this mean I'll have to wait for the next release for the bug to be fixed after I've submitted the report ?

Best case is that we fix a *future* release of Tails, yes.
Worst case is that we don't have enough information to do so, or the problem is out of our hands.

We still have absolutely not enough information about this problem to answer this question, sorry.
