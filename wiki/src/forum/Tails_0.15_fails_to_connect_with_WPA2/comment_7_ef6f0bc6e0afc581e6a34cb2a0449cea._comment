> I am almost certain that the issue is with the wireless card's driver, therefore I want to give madwifi package a try, but I don't know how to install it on Tails.

I'm happy to help fix the bug in the driver that is included in the upstream kernel (and consequently in Debian's one), but sorry, I have no time to spend on third-party drivers.
