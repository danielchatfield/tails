Hi. I have managed to solve this issue after searching on the internet. I did so by running the following commands: 

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo rmmod -f ath5k
sudo modprobe ath5k nohwcrypt=1
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

I really dont know what these commands actually do as I'm a begginger. Can someone please explain?
