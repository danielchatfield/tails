Working on a host (Ubuntu 10.10 - Maverick) Live CD session, I am attempting
to modify a few files of the tails-i386-0.8.iso file to eliminate having to
do it on every boot up.

I have the squashfs-tools package (Ubuntu) installed, and it appears that
when I issue a mount command to loop mount the tails live/filesystem.squashfs
I get the following errors:

1.From mount command:
    mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/loop2,
    missing codepage or helper program, or other error
    In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
    dmesg | tail  or so

2.From dmesg | tail:
SQUASHFS error: Filesystem uses "unknown" compression. This is not supported

Apparently, squashfs tools compatibility is missing regarding squashfs tools
between Debian and Ubuntu.

All I want to do is to make a few edits, etc. and remake the tails 0.8
.iso file.  Via Synaptic Package Manager, the following Debian packages are
available in the Ubuntu universe repository:
live-build, live-build-cgi, live-helper, live-magic, live-manual, livecd-rootfs

I have just read the live-manual.pdf document and did not find any relevant
information about what I am trying to do.

What do I need to do to complete the mounting of the tails
live/filesystem.squashfs regarding the unknown compression capability, and
then after I make the edits - I was planning to use the mksquashfs command
to regenerate the tails .iso - will that work, and if not, what do I need
to do to make it happen?
