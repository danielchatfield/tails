OP here.  Glad someone agrees with me about Nautilus.  I can't imagine how such a poorly performing file manager is part of the default Gnome desktop, but I have worked with a few senior Gnome developers and they happen to use recent MacBook Pros (not Linux) and/or high-powered PC towers for their day jobs.  I wonder if any of the Gnome team have ever tried to work with Gnome on older hardware and experienced just how bad Nautilus actually is.  Gnome has gone way downhill.  Ironically it used to run faster *before* they ripped half of the useful configurations out and crippled the interface.
