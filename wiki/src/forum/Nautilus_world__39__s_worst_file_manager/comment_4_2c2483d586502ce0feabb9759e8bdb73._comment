Puppy is perhaps the least secure distro that I am aware of. 

Runs everything as root.

Regularly includes woefully outdated packages, including browsers. 

Is nearly impossible to properly update.

Gives an option for saving one's \"Pup file\" with \"Light encryption\" without warning that this is completely useless. (see http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=598337&sid=7d36308b7626f6f6d3adde8068995c97 )
