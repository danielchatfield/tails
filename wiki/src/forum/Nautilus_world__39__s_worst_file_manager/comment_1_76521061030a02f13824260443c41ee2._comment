In short: tails might be better served with a lighter desktop.  Others have also offered that opinion. Gnome is heavy, slow and defeatured all at the same time.  It's possible to set up a lighter desktop with drag and drop and everything useful that GNome does but without the enormous bloat. Just look at Puppy or the various options available for Tinycore.
