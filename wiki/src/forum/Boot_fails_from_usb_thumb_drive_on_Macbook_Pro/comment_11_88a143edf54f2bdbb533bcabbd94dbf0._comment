....and, when in tails after booting with USB 1 (rEFIt) and USB 2 (Tails Unetbootin), you can try to add a 3rd USB to include persistance.

1) unmount and eject USB 1
2) insert and mount USB 3
3) create a \"live USB\" from Tails menu on USB 3

Doing this we may even achieve persistance on USB 3 (but the system runs on USB 1)
