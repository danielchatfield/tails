Hi All,

trying to boot 'Tails'from the usb drive, I'm running in the same problem (Boot fails with \"no bootable device found\" message).
rEFIt allready installed, which recognizes tha linux system residing in the usb drive, trying to boot, but encounters the above described error message.

Has anybody suggestions/solutions?

Please HELP!!!

Thanx a lot!
