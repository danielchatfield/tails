This is a rEFIt issue experienced in some middle and all late 2011 Macbooks.
Unfortunately rEFIt developers abandoned the project some time ago.

Seems Apple has taken steps to lock down it's hardware (no surprises there).

Until a developer with the time and the inclination picks up the gauntlet, Live linux USB is off the menu.

Try sending this guy an email http://www.rodsbooks.com/

Perhaps he will accept a challenge. :)
