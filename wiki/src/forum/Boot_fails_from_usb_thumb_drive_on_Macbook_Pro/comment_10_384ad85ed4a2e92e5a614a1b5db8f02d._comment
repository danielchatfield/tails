Aight!

The solution is that one:
        <https://tails.boum.org/forum/Mac_Support/> [Mac OS X Unetbootin guide]

According to that, this is just a summary of my own steps on Mac OS X 10.8.2:

1.	\"download rEFIt\"
	<http://sourceforge.net/projects/refit/>
2.	double-click the image and unpack all
3.	start the os x disk utility
4.	locate and select your usb (be sure to identify the right one!)
5.	format it as \"Mac OS Extended (Journaled)\"
6.	copy the \"efi\" folder from rEFIt distribution to the root level of the USB memory stick
7.	Open a Terminal and enter the following commands:

	cd /Volumes/MyStick/efi/refit

	./enable.sh

	If you are not logged in root you'll be asked for your password; if so, enter your password.
8.	start the os x disk utility once more
9.	locate and select your usb (be sure to identify the right one!)
10.	click on the partition tab
11.	Select 1 Partition
12.	verify if GUID is selected
13.	select FAT as Format
14.	click Apply
15.	Open Unetbootin
16.	select the Tails ISO file as Diskimage
17.	choose USB Drive as Type
18.	locate and select your usb drive (be sure to identify the right one!)
19.	press OK
20.	wait for Unetbootin to terminateâ€¦[done]

THANX to <https://tails.boum.org/forum/Mac_Support/> :-)
