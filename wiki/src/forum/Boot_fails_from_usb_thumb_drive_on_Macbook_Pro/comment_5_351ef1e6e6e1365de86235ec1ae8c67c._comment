Just come across this thread and many more. I have a mid 2011 macbook with the same issue. Can boot tails via refit+dvd but refit+usb fails. Rods investigation is very helpful although there is still nothing to help those of us without a skill set in configuring boot loaders to get tails booted.

I do have a laptop I can use but its embarrassing sitting in Starbucks with a Dell machine.

In all seriousness though I think the implementation of an EFI bootloader when creating the tails USB needs to come from the Tails team if they can find the time, as Rod seems to think that will be a reasonable workaround to the problem.

Thanks,
