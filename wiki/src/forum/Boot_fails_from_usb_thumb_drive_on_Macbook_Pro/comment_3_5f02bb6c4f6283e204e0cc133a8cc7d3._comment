First, an introduction: I'm Rod Smith, and I've \"picked up the gauntlet\" on rEFIt development with my fork, rEFInd (<http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/>).

I've never used Tails (I was pointed here by a user), and I lack a modern Mac on which to test it, so I can't say that this is definitely the problem; but my understanding is that BIOS-mode boots of external media on Macs are a hit-or-miss proposition, and always have been. The rEFIt documentation has this to say:

<http://refit.sourceforge.net/help/usb_disk.html>

Note that's the rEFIt documentation, not my rEFInd documentation; it's *at least* two years old, so the failure to boot external media in BIOS mode is *not* new.

Apple's firmware seems to be more flexible when doing EFI-mode boots. Fortunately, Linux can boot in EFI mode, and configuring it to do so from a USB flash drive is relatively straightforward, at least for somebody who's able to create a bootable live CD distribution:

1. Use FAT on the medium. If you don't normally use FAT, create a separate partition, ideally tagged as an EFI System Partition (MBR type code 0xEF, or its equivalent on GPT, which is EF00 in gdisk or setting the \"boot flag\" in parted).
2. Place a Linux boot loader on the FAT partition, as EFI/boot/bootx64.efi (for 64-bit systems; some early Macs are 32-bit, and would need EFI/boot/bootia32.efi instead).
3. Configure the Linux boot loader to load your distribution's kernel and initial RAM disk.

Such a disk will boot in EFI mode on EFI-enabled PCs. Such a disk might or might not boot on Macs without a bit of extra help; they can be a bit picky. rEFIt or rEFInd should detect the boot loader and launch it, though (rEFIt and rEFInd both qualify as \"extra help\" on this matter).

Note that selecting and configuring a boot loader is a daunting task if you're unfamiliar with the field. I've got a Web page devoted to the topic, <http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/>.

If you as an individual need to get Tails booting *right now*, you should be able to do so by installing a Linux EFI boot loader on either the Tails disk or your computer's hard disk. Overall, Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy is likely to be the easiest to install, and I have download links to a suitable tarball at <http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/grub_legacy.html>. Note that your ability to get it working as a standalone system depends on Tails using at least one FAT partition. If it doesn't do that, you'll need to either modify the partitioning so that it's got a FAT EFI System Partition or install the boot loader on the Mac's hard disk.
