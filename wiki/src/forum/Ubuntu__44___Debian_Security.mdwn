according to wikipedia:

"Ubuntu compiles their packages using gcc features such as PIE and Buffer overflow protection to harden their software. These extra features greatly increase security at the performance expense of 1% in 32 bit and 0.01% in 64 bit."

believe debian is currently missing these but heard talk that debian wheezy might ship with these default. i like debian very much, but is ubuntu a better desktop distribution to base tails off?

just curious. thank you for any and all info.

JD.

to tails team: thanks for all your work.
