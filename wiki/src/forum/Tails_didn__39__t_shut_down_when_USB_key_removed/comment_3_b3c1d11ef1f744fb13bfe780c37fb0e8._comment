OP here again with a few more details to add,

Tails was running for about 3 hours before I fell asleep so when I pulled the flash thumb drive in the morning it had been running for about 11-12 hours total. Computer has 2 X  2gig Kingston 800mhx sdram if that helps.

I'm pretty sure it's not a big deal but decided to report it here because I thought it was really strange that it was running and usable without the USB key in the drive, and that pulling it didn't activate the shutdown like it's supposed to.
