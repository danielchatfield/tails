Hello, I just used the (perhaps misleadingly named) unsafe web browser for the first time today.
In doing so I noticed that it seems to be impossible to save files downloaded from the internet to other folder other than clearnet or the File System, and after the download the files do not appear where they were saved.

I wonder, is this the desired behavior? and if so for what reason?

I saw another user in this forum remarking that besides the fact the unsafe web browser not beeing anonymous it could actually be safer than the iceweasel since it makes it harder for a MITM attack targeted against a specific website...(say tails.boum.org).

When considering that non-Tor downloading is also faster, and for larger files waiting can be tedious should this inability to save files from clearnet not be fixed/changed? 

(As a side note, I trust tails unsafe web browser more than my normal browser on windows...I'm quite sure that while unsafe...it is still safer..)
