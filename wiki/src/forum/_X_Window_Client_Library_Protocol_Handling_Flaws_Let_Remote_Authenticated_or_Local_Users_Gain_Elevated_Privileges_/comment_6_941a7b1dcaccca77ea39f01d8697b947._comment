I am not aware of any Linux live CD distribution which offers a suitable alternative to Tails.

You could possibly experiment with live installing the security patches yourself (as Debian packages in the Debian repositories), but I suspect this would be more dangerous than sticking with the latest Tails and hoping for the best.  Also, you need to boot with a root password to live install.
