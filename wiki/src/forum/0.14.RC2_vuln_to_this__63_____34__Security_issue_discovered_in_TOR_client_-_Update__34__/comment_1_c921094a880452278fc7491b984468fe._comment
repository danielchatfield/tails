Assuming running Tor binaries were built with a compiler that has this bug and the machine crashed suddenly or the plug was pulled with that data still in memory, it might possibly be recovered by a cold boot attack.  That requires an attacker to have physical control of the machine though and a clean shutdown on Tails will wipe the memory anyway.
