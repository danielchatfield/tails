Sorry for being a bit harsh about that sometimes. We are running on very limited human resources and following up closely the activity of the forum is a very time-consuming task. That's why we are sometimes a bit crude about the ways we try to limit the quantity of what is being said here. Also take into account that we are not a single person and each one of us might react or feel differently about that. And maybe the intro phrase of the forum could be made a bit more friendly; patches are welcome.

  - We say this is not the place for bug reports because there are better ways to do that and most of the time people give too little information about their problem on the forum. So we usually tell people to report a bug when we believe this is needed.
  - We say this is not a place for feature request because that is better done on the development mailing list where devs read things and can discuss about. But I'm pretty sure that interesting proposals have been made here already.
  - We say this is not the place for computer security essays and conspiranoia because there are too often not directly related to Tails, or unfounded or annoying to our eyes, and we don't want to spend time on that.

This is the place for:

  - User support: solving doubts about how to use Tails, security implications of Tails, etc. More and more we see other people than us answer those questions. That's great.
  - Community interaction: sometimes people post information and tricks about ways of using Tails that are not officially documented but might be of interest to others. Our task is to point out when there are security implications to that, but free software is to play with as well.
  - Small issues: many times people here pointed out small things that we needed to fix and do not require a complete bug report. That's fine and we appreciate it.
