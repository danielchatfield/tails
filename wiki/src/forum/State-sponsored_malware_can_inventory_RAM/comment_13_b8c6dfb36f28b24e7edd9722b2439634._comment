@ 11, regarding malware infection methods:


Gamma International GmbH (based in Munich) and Elaman GmbH (also based in Munich) are two subsidiaries of Gamma Group.  Both companies are multinational corporations which offer various surveillance-as-a-service \"products\".  

Gamma International specializes in providing two types of surveillance.  To adopt Gamma's parlance:

* \"tactical surveillance\" targets individuals using \"Tactical Surveillance Units\" (TSUs)
* \"strategic surveillance\" involves national-scale dragnet surveillance of all citizens

The CEO of Gamma International is Martin J. Muench, who is known on the trade show circuit simply as \"MJM\".  To Linux fans he may be better known as one of the coauthors of the popular Linux live-CD forensics distribution BackTrack, now known as Kali Linux.

Elaman acts as a reseller of Gamma gear and also provides training.

Broadly speaking, Gamma surveillance kits can target at least four kinds of devices over a wide area:

* Computers using Windows (usually Windows 2000 or later) are targeted by FinFisher or FinSpy kits
* Computers using Linux, Windows or BSD Unix are targeted by FinFly kits
* Mobile phones are targeted by FinSpy-Mobile kits
* Bluetooth devices are targeted by FinBluez kits

All of these methods can be (and to hear Gamma tell it, have been) scaled from surveillance of specific individuals to dragnet surveillance of entire nations.

If none of these prove sufficient for the purposes of our adversaries, Elaman offers some further possibilities: 

* Any computer using a WiFi keyboard can be monitored using Gamma FinWifiKey kits
* if none of these work, Elaman rents surveillance vans tricked out with Gamma gear which can target the Van Eck emissions of any Tempest-unprotected electronic device using directional antennae 

These methods have two drawbacks:

* they are short range (20-50 m)
* they generally require a TSU to surveil each individual target

Thus, they cannot be scaled up to dragnet surveillance systems, and they tend to be quite expensive.

Most of these surveillance methods involve infection with Gamma malware.  The methods of infection fall into two broad cases:

* remote infection
* direct infection

Remote infection is generally preferred since no human interference is needed for either infection or monitoring; further, both infection and monitoring can easily be scaled to country-scale mass infection and surveillance.  Direct infection methods require the physical presence of at least one human agent (even an entire TSU), sometimes requires brief access to an unattended (but possibly powered down) device, and generally cannot be scaled to country-wide infection.

Remote infection vectors include:

* Malware-loading attachments to phishing emails, texts, or phone calls.

As shown by Citizen Labs, some Bahraini activists were send an email, supposedly from an Al Jazeera reporter, Melissa Chan, who has covered the civil unrest in Bahrain, with attached images.  The images disguised the malware loading by exploiting a bug in the software which enables users to type both left-to-right and right-to-left languages.  (Citizen Labs pointed out that the real Melissa Chan most likely had nothing to do with the phishing emails.)

* Malware-serving websites

In some cases, government websites have been used to serve Gamma malware.  From a Gamma marketing flier:

> The customer deployed FinFly-ISP within the main Internet Service Provider of their country. It was combined with FinFly Web to remotely infect Targets that visited government offensive websites by covertly injecting the FinFly Web code into the targeted websites.

In other cases, websites have been created especially for specific targets; when an unsuspecting person shows up at the website, the malware-loader exploits a zero-day flaw in a browser (in some cases, Firefox).  From a Gamma flier:

> After profiling a Target, the [Technical Surveillance Unit] created a website of interest for the Target and sent him the link through a discussion board. Upon opening the Link to the unit’s website, a Remote Monitoring Solution was installed on the Target System and the Target was monitored from within Headquarters.

But any website will do.  From a Gamma flier:

> The new release [of FinFly-ISP] now integrates Gamma’s powerful remote infection application FinFly-Web to infect Targets on-the-fly by just visiting any website.

* Specific targets can be infected by inserting an invisible proxy between their PC and their ISP, which mounts a MITM attack, and secretly merges the malware loader with a download of legitimate software

From Gamma and Elaman fliers:

> FinFly-ISP was deployed in the main Internet Service Provider networks of the country and was actively used to remotely deploy a Remote Monitoring Solution on Target Systems. As the Targets have Dynamic-IP DSL Accounts, they are identified with their Radius Logon Name.

> FinFly-ISP is able to infect Files that are downloaded by the Target on-the-fly or infect the Target by sending fake Software Updates for popular Software. 

Activists have documented cases in which Gamma malware was disguised as an update to Firefox, which led to the recent legal action by Mozilla against Gamma.

Direct infection vectors include:

* TSUs can register at the same hotel or sit down in the same cybercafe as a target, and by simply getting their Gamma-provided infectious computer onto the same LAN being used by the target, can clandestinely install the Gamma malware onto the target's computer.  From two Gamma fliers:

> FinFly-LAN was used to remotely install the Remote Monitoring Solution on the computer of a Target while he was using it inside his hotel room. The Agents were in another room connected to the same network and manipulated the Websites the Target was visiting to trigger the installation.

>  A Technical Surveillance Unit was following a Target for weeks without being able to physically access the target computer. They used FinFly-LAN to install the Remote Monitoring Solution on the target computer when he was using a public Hotspot at a coffee shop.

* simply booting a unintended laptop or PC using a Gamma provided infectious USB stick or CD will install Gamma malware; this operation is said to take less than a minute and requires no special skills

From a Gamma flier:

> [An informant who had infiltrated the target group] was given a FinFly-USB that secretly installed a Remote Monitoring Solution on several computers of the group when they were using the device to exchange documents between each other. The Target Systems could then be remotely monitored from Headquarters, and the FinFly-USB was later returned

> [An information] was given a Fin-USB Dongle that secretly extracted Account Credentials of Web and Email accounts and Microsoft Office documents from the Target Systems, while the OCG used the USB device to exchange regular files like Music, Video and Office Documents. After returning the USB device to Headquarters the gathered data could be decrypted, analyzed and used to constantly monitor the group remotely.

Once infection is complete, the consequences for the victim's privacy are dire, particularly if the infected machine has a working microphone or webcam.

> FinSpy Mobile was deployed on BlackBerry mobile phones of several Targets to monitor all communications, including SMS/MMS, Email and BlackBerry Messenger.

> FinSpy Mobile was covertly deployed on the mobile phones of several members of a [target group]. Using the GPS tracking data and silent calls, essential information could be gathered from every meeting that was held by this group.

While not all of Gamma products can necessarily can do all of these things, Gamma does claim such capabilities as these:

* infection procedure customized for each target
* evasion of anti-malware software on target computer
* enumerate all users and their hashed logon passwords
* enumerate all internet accounts with any stored passwords
* enumerate all attached devices by their nature and unique identifiers
* enumerate all programs and services autolaunched upon booting
* enumerate all installed software
* enumerate all running processes
* enumerate all open TCP/UDP ports
* enumerate all open files
* read the history of all konsole commands
* read any cookies stored by a web-browser
* read the browsing history stored by a web-browser
* read all passwords stored by a web-browser
* monitor DNS requests
* record all connections by IP address
* collect TCP/UDP/ICMP statistics
* search the hard-drive for files with a given extension
* search for recently created or modified files
* read any contact lists
* read any emails and text messages
* monitor any chat conversations (including Pidgin)
* recover any encryption keys
* record all keystrokes
* secretly activate the microphone and use the computer as an audio bug
* secretly activate the webcam and use a laptop as as video surveillance bug
* modify any file, or create new ones (handy for creating faked evidence against political dissidents)
* unobtrusive, clandestine, encrypted exfiltration of data to a Gamma server
* on the Gamma server, apply rainbow tables and other techniques to try to crack any log-on password hashes found in the password file
* remove all traces of the Gamma infection
* or at the other extreme: wipe the hard-drive

Gamma and Elaman marketing literature makes it quite clear that these companies are attempting to corner not only the \"lawful intrusion\" [sic] markets, but also the cyberwar markets.  (Cyberwar-as-a-service; who could have imagined that in Orwell's day?)  This creates an immediate and disturbing blurring of the lines between 
* the traditional \"ethos\" of law enforcement agents in \"Western\" nations
* the unseemly manipulations of \"information operatives\"
* the highly unethical and generally illegal methods of cyberspies
* the sometimes purely destructive goals of cyberwarriors

For those customers who don't wish to contract with Gamma for expensive long-term support operations, but would rather train their own employees in cyberespionage and cyberwar techniques, Elaman also offers a wide range of courses.

Frightened enough to desire immunity against FinSpy?  No fear, Gamma will sell you \"FinSpy Antidote\", if you can pay their price.  Of course, there is probably no guarantee that someone else might pay an even steeper price for the antidote to the antidote.  In this game, only MJM wins.

Unless we all band together and pressure our governments to crush Gamma out of existence.  It's not out of the question that this might happen, now that organizations like Mozilla and powerful politicians in the US and UK are making angry sounds about the kinds of governments which have use Gamma malware to arrest and torture or kill bloggers and political dissidents.  

And that is by no means all.  There is good reason to think that Gamma gear may been used by the Assad regime to target and kill specific reporters who were covering the Syrian conflict for major Western media outlets.
No wonder that even such conservative news organizations as the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News, the New York Times, and the Times of London, have had harsh things to say about MJM and his monster.

Muench may have abused a wider variety of legitimate \"brands\" than is yet recognized to disguise Gamma malware.  In a strange post to a BSD mailing list he says that he wants to use the BSD logo for... well, he doesn't spell that out.

Seeming an innocent request, but as it turns out, maybe not so innocent after all.  (MJM was told the image is copyrighted, so maybe FreeBSD should look into whether Gamma went ahead and misused their logo anyway.)
