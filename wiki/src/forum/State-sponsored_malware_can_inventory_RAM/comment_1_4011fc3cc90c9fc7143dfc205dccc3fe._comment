CIPAV is said to be almost a decade old, so if the court order does refer to CIPAV, it is likely the current state-of-the-art state-sponsored malware has even more capabilities than those described in the court order.

Some additional points:

* it seems that Gamma International's spyware suite has similar capabilities, and it has been independently confirmed by several human rights organizations that this malware has somehow become available to Syrian intelligence and other entities which have used it to attack persons living outside the war zone.

* US TLA's, including the FBI, are pushing hard in the US Congress for legislation (CISPA) which will enable them to use their malware *without* judicial oversight.  Some of us have warned repeatedly that this affects everyone in the world, and in the case in question (i) the FBI does not know the country in which the target computer is located (ii) the judge felt that they were overreaching.  This tends to confirm our warnings about the potential danger which the FBI's cyberspies pose to the world.
