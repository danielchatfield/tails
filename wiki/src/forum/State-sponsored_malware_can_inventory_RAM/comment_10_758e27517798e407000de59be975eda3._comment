F/U on the comment concerning Gamma International's spyware line (FinFisher, FinSpy, etc):

If you or I truncate a long url in the browser pane because a web page is so badly designed that we can't quickly see how to back up one level in directory tree, to give on example of a common and innocuous on-line action, someone like Carmen Ortiz could conceivably charge us with a felony under US law, even extradite us to the US for sentencing to those unpleasant institutions where the US houses some 1% of its population at government expense.   

But when a surveillance company like Gamma International hawks elaborately faked \"updates\" of Mozilla firefox in order to infect human rights activists with their malware on behalf of clients like the now defunct Gadhafi government in Libya or the now defunct Mubarak government in Egypt, they get away clean.

Until now.

> A recent report by Citizen Lab uncovered that commercial spyware produced by Gamma International is designed to trick people into thinking it’s Mozilla Firefox. We’ve sent Gamma a cease and desist letter today demanding that these illegal practices stop immediately.

Good on you, Mozilla!
