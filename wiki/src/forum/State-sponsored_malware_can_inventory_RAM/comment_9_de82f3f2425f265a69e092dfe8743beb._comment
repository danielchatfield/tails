For Tails users who use a persistent Tails system booted from R/W live USB stick:

A stop-gap idea which may help to prevent malware from accessing your Tails browser bookmarks:

* when first use Tails browser, backup default bookmarks on encrypted USB
* if possible, before shutting down Tails, disconnect from network, mount encrypted USB, and restore the default bookmarks
* shut down Tails
