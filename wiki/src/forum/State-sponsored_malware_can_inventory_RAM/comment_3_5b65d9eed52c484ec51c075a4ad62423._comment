Another important point:

If a Tails user mounts an encrypted volume on the hard drive, key material will neccessarily reside in RAM, and it is known from technical articles in \"police journals\" that adversaries know how to search for and exploit this material.  And from the court order published by Cryptome, and from other sources including Gamma International marketing literature, we know that FBI malware, Gamma malware, and no doubt otherstate-sponsored malware have the capability to *remotely* search the RAM in a running computer and to clandestinely report to the attacker any \"useful\" information found there.

This underlines the critical importance of developing ASAP tools which wipe sensitive key material from RAM when a drive is unmounted.  Until such tools are available in Tails, would-be whistleblowers should use caution.  For example:

* while computer is running \"other OS\":
* mount encrypted volume
* mount encrypted USB stick using different passphrase
* transfer file to USB stick
* unmount volumes and detach USB stick
* shutdown computer
* wait five minutes
* reboot using Tails on a R/O DVD:
* while computer is running Tails:
* insert and mount encrypted USB stick
* transfer file to Tails (amnesia home)
* use Tails browser to surf to a leak site with a good reputation
* shutdown Tails (using the memory wipe)
