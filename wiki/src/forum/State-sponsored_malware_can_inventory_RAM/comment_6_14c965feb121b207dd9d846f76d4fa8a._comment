An important point:

It is known from information provided to reporters by US government sources that the US TLAs maintain at least one database which attempts to keep the unique hardware identifier of every USB stick and hard drive ever manufactured.  These identifiers would be among the most sought after information to be found in the RAM of any computer infected with state-sponsored malware capable of searching the RAM of a running computer.

However, it seems doubtful if even the NSA and/or Google really know the unique hardware identifiers of every hard drive and USB stick in the world.  Even if they did, security experts say that there is a huge difference between *keeping* data somewhere like the Utah data center and actually being able to *find* data there when an adversary wants to harm someone protesting against some controversial government policy (for example).
