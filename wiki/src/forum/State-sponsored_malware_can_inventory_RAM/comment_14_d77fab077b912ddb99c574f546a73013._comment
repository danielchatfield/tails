A few loose ends:

I forgot to mention that a marketing document from Elaman uses a logo which is almost indistinguishable from the shark fin logo used by the open source packet-sniffer Wireshark.

To mangle Oscar Wilde's bon mot: one instance could be coincidence, two form a pattern, and three looks like simple carelessness.

I also forgot to mention another Gamma intrusion kit which enables another vector for direct infection:

* An agent who gains brief physical access to a targeted computer with a Firewire port can use FinFireWire, which Gamma claims will bypass password-protected screensavers in order to image RAM and any mounted encrypted hard-drives.  (This is typical of the rather crude \"solutions\" being used by our adversaries to overcome strong encryption.)

From a Gamma marketing flier:

> A Forensic Unit entered the apartment of a Target and tried to access the computer system. The computer was switched on but the screen was locked. As they were not allowed, for legal reasons, to use a Remote Monitoring Solution, they would have lost all data by switching off the system as the hard-disk was fully encrypted. FinFireWire was used to unlock the running Target System enabling the Agent to copy all files before switching the computer off and taking it back to Headquarters.

> Combining the product with traditional Forensic applications like Encase, Forensic units used the RAM dump functionality to make a snapshot of the current RAM information and recovered the Hard-Disk encryption passphrase for TrueCrypt’s full disk encryption.

I also forgot to mention another remote intrusion method:

* Adversaries who desire to remotely intrude into WiFi LANs, which are common in homes, medical and law offices, etc., can use yet another piece of Gamma intrusion kit, FinIntrusion, which Gamma claims can break WEP, WPA-1, WPA-2 passphrases using dictionary attacks (yeah, big whoop) and also SSL encrypted traffic (so much for Tor, then?).  From another Gamma flier:

> The FinIntrusion Kit was used to break the WPA encryption of a Target’s home Wireless network and then monitor his Webmail (Gmail, Yahoo, …) and Social Network (Facebook, MySpace, …) credentials, which enabled the investigators to remotely monitor these accounts from Headquarters without the need to be close to the Target.

> Several customers used the FinIntrusion Kit to successfully compromise the security of networks and computer systems for offensive and defensive purposes using various Tools and Techniques.

Gamma claims FinIntrusion is widely used for \"strategic use\" (a euphemism for country-scale dragnet surveillance):

> The FinIntrusion Kit is widely used to remotely gain access to Target Email Accounts and Target Web-Servers (e.g. Blogs, Discussion Boards) and monitor their activities, including Access-Logs and more.
