> computer security essays and conspiranoia

One infers that at least one Tails developer considers comments 1-17 can be characterized as either \"essays\" or \"conspiranoia\"; we hope the former characterization was the one intended.  

(If not, I remind \"Tails\" that a Tor developer has verified that he was told by Dutch police investigators that the Dutch police are in fact using malware, that the authenticity of the marketing fliers is not in doubt, that numerous news stories published by reputable news organizations have discussed CIPAV, that the quoted court order is a public document whose authenticity is easily verified, on so on.  So the fact that police around the world are using malware, and that companies like Gamma are selling malware, is established as a matter of fact.)

I feel that both Tails users and Tails developers should be aware that Tor users (and thus, Tails users) are increasingly likely to be targeted using malware which inventories RAM.  One urgent implication of that fact is the developers of Tails and other cryptography-using software must pay much more attention to how sensitive information is stored in RAM, and if possible to make it as difficult as possible for malware to successfully exploit data found in RAM.

That said, I also appreciate Comment 22.  And if I criticize, it must be remembered that I do so because I think Tails is so valuable that I want to see its value to be further enhanced.
