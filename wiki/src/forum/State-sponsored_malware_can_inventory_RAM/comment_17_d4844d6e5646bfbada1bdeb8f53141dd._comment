Citizen Lab has identified Gamma C&C servers in at least 25 countries, and states that they are confident this figure underestimates the true extent of Gamma's presence on the internet.

So how have Gamma's tentacles spread over much of the world in a pervasive surveillance stranglehold?  Through business relations with other surveillance corporations, and through contracts with \"governmental\" clients.

Gamma International GmbH is a subsidiary of Gamma Group, which seems to be basically a shell company in the UK.  The names and addresses of three of its subsidiaries are:

      Gamma International GmbH
      Baierbrunner Str. 15
      81379 Munich
      GERMANY
      gamma-international.de

      Elaman GmbH
      German Security Solutions
      Baierbrunner Strasse 15
      81379 Munich 
      GERMANY
      elaman.de

      Gamma TSE Ltd
      Andover, Unit 6, Parnell Court, East Portway Industrial Estate
      Hampshire, SP10 3LX
      UK
      gammagroup.com

Notice that the street addresses for Elaman GmbH and Gamma International GmbH are the same.

Gamma admits that it maintains offices in Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Africa, the UAE, and the UK.

Gamma apparently has created various overseas shell companies, whose sole purpose is to serve as the owner of record for the domains of FinSpy C&C malware servers located in various countries whose secret police are among Gamma's valued customers.  

For example, a FinSpy C&C server in Lebanon is registered to:

      Cyan Engineering Services SAL
      Broadway Center, 7th Floor
      Hamra Street â€“ Chouran 1102-2050
      Beirut, Beirut 00000
      LEBANON
      it-intrusion.com
      Contact: Johnny Debs

(To repeat: \"Johnny Debs\" was also listed as the contact person for Gamma International in a June 2010 tender to the since deposed Mubarak regime, and someone by that name has represented Gamma at surveillance trade shows.)

The Gamma Group office which ran a national scale surveillance system for the now defunct Gadhafi regime in Libya was located at

     Gamma Group Office: Beirut-Bir Hassan
     Tel: ++9613432334
     Email: info@gammagroup.com.lb

For all I know that office is still active, but now working for the new government.

Gamma maintains a tangle of business partnerships with other multinational surveillance-as-a-service corporations.  

Utimaco Sophos (formerly Utimaco Safeware AG), which has offices in the UK and US, appears to serve as a reseller of Gamma malware.  Utimaco partners in turn with some other notorious surveillance corporations:

* Trovicor GmbH, based in Munich: runs a national scale dragnet-surveillance-as-a-service system in Bahrain, via a subsidiary called \"Trovicor Sdn Bhd\", and another in Pakistan, via \"Trovicor Intelligence Solutions Ltd.\"; another subsidiary, TruePosition is in Dubai
* Area SpA, based near Como, ITALY: installed and ran a national scale dragnet-surveillance-as-a-service system, \"Asfador\", for the Assad regime in Syria, put claims it pulled out after bad press
* NetApp, Inc, based in Sunnyvale CA: provides ISP scale dragnet-surveillance-as-a-service for many US IPS, and provided a key element of Asfador, but claims \"Look, we have no idea how that got into Syria. We just don't understand how this happened\"
* i2 Intelligence Solutions, a subsidiary of i2 Group, which has an office in McLean, VA, and which performs \"Big Data\" analysis for the FBI using products with names like \"IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook\"

Utimaco's US office is:

      10 Lincoln Road Suite 102
      Foxboro, MA 02035
      USA
      utimaco.com

That location is somewhat ironic because, as the authors of internal \"failure memos\" circulated inside the DHS were quick to point out, i2 Group's very expensive video analytics utterly failed to prevent the recent incident in Boston despite the massive ip camera surveillance of the affected area.  (One of i2 Group's \"talking points\" has been a claimed ability to pick out the face of anyone on the million member terror watch list, which obviously didn't happen in the case of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.)

Trovicor's address is:

      Trovicor GmbH
      Machtlfinger Strasse 7
      Munich, 81379
      GERMANY
      trovicor.de
      trovicor.com

The US office of i2 Group is at:

      I2 Group
      1430 Spring Hill Road, Suite 600
      McLean, VA 22102
      USA
      i2group.com

One fact which is apparent from even this brief resume is that many of the supposedly distinct companies with ties to Gamma are located in Munich.
 
The most dire threat is probably posed by rogue regimes using Gamma malware to target activists.  I stress again that there are known cases of activists living outside countries in the throes of civil war who have been targeted by the current governments of such countries with malware.

But it bears repeating that Dutch police agencies, as well as German police, may be currently using Gamma malware (possibly without effective judicial oversight) to attack servers running hidden services.  This potentially affects any user of any hidden service.

All in all, there seems to be good reason to think that Gamma malwares are among the greatest threats currently faced by the community of Tor users.
