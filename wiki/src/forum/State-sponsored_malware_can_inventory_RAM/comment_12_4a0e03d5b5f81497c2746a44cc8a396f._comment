> Any idea of what conditions the type of malware under discussion here would require in order to infect a system?

I lack time today, but later I can provide more detailed information regarding Gamma International's tangled corporate history, colorful CEO, various malware-as-a-service products, and documented infection methods.

Here is a quick hint for one known method of infection by a specific Gamma malware known as \"FinSpy Mobile\", which targets smart phones.  From

    https://citizenlab.org/2013/03/you-only-click-twice-finfishers-global-proliferation-2/

> A FinSpy campaign in Ethiopia uses pictures of Ginbot 7, an Ethiopian opposition group, as bait to infect users. This continues the theme of FinSpy deployments with strong indications of politically-motivated targeting.

There are more links in the Wikipedia article

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinFisher

and you can find many more by searching on such keywords as FinFisher and FinSpy.

The most informative sources include:

* Numerous news stories, such as Bloomberg News \"Wired for Repression\" series, for example:

* Promotional literature from Gamma International GmbH, which includes technical details and revelatory examples of how \"customers\" have used their malware to target individual citizens:

* Detailed technical reports from Citizen Labs, Kaspersky, and others.

Gamma is only one of dozens of international corporations and smaller companies which provide malware-as-a-service to (apparently) anyone able to pay some hefty fees.  Several of these specialize in providing national-scale universal surveillance systems; others specialize in providing malware targeting particular individuals.  Companies such as Gamma stress in their marketing literature that their malware can secretly infect the devices of even individuals who are technically able to resist ordinary surveillance methods (for example by using Tor).

The main point which I believe is not yet adequately explained in the currently available public sources of information about state-sponsored malware is the role of genuine SSL certificates improperly issued by a genuine Certificate Authority, either through cyberintrusion, trickery, or governmental duress, which have been used to \"authenticate\" state-sponsored malware disguised as legitimate Firefox add-ons, for example.  Other disguises have included updates to legitimate software including anti-virus software for Windows users.

Some of the most detailed information available about state-sponsored national-scale surveillance was obtained when attempted cybersnooping operations mounted by less capable companies than Gamma went wrong, for example a clumsy attempt to trojan all Blackberry users in one Middle Eastern country with state-sponsored malware (bought from another Western company) disguised as a \"security upgrade\" from the national telecom.

There is a strong worldwide trend, even in \"Western democracies\" such as the USA and Holland, to enact legislation 

* mandating national-scale warrantless surveillance backdoors for all civilian cryptography
* permitting unrestricted warrantless malware infection of individual devices whenever government agencies or even corporations (in Canada, even copyright trolls) feel they have some \"reason\" to do so

And there is a seemingly irresistable worldwide trend inside police agencies to

* acquire ever more invasive (and expensive) technological mass surveillance capabilities far beyond anything Orwell envisioned (absolutely including spying on citizens inside their own homes, monitoring conversations on the street, a kind of bodily invasion using remote surveillance gear which can monitor physiological parameters, and more)
* drown in the resulting torrents of data which is distracting, endlessly confusing, and ultimately useless and pointless except to intimidate citizens by confronting them in police interviews with precise information about all their activities on such and such a day
* become increasingly dissatisified with the \"insufficient\" data already at their disposal, resulting in a clamor for ever more warrantless \"black bag jobs\", ever more invasive and pervasive cyber-surveillance and cyber-intrusions (which unlike physical surveillance can be easily turned into massive operations once the malware has been written and deployed)

The US government in particular has also shown a well documented tendency to

* manufacture its own \"terrorist plots\" using criminals paid by the government to trick developmentally disabled persons or recent immigrants into serving as the fall guy for a government manufactured \"plot\" which the police agencies can then crow to the press about \"interrupting\"
* vastly over-react to those very rare apparently genuine terrorist incidents in ways which cause far more damage and disruption than anything the \"terrorist\" could ever have done

Unfortunately, many other nations tend to eventually follow the US model in matters of national surveillance and cyberwarfare, so this kind of behavior may spread to other countries.

> How/why could that be conceivably be a felon under U.S. law?

Sorry that I don't have a link handy, and can't recall enough to find one, but in a Deeplinks post in the past two years, the EFF discussed a very similar scenario which actually resulted in prosecution, conviction, and a very lengthy prison sentence (something like 37 years).   EFF Deeplinks and ACLU Blog of Rights often cover horrifying examples of the ever increasing tendency of US prosecutors to turn mundane daily on-line activities into felonies carrying 50 year sentences, using ancient or overly broadly written laws which the US Appeal courts have consistently neglected to strike down.
