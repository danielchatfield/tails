what is this forum for? That is my question, because I get tired of reading the same thing from TAILS everytime they get a thread they don't like.

TAILS, what are we supposed to talk about in this forum? not bugs or features requests, not security dangers, what are we supposed to talk about???
I for one loved reading all of this info ;)
