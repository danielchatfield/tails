Oops, forgot to quote from a Gamma flier describing a country-scale dragnet surveillance system using FinSpy:

> FinSpy was installed on several computer systems inside Internet Cafes in critical areas in order to monitor them for suspicious activity, especially Skype communication to foreign individuals. Using the Webcam, pictures of the Targets were taken while they were using the system.
