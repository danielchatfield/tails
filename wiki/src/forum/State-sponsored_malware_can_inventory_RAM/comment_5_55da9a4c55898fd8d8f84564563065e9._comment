It is definitely possible for citizens of the world to defeat the instruments of state repression.  In fact there are many indications that despite all the omnivorous NSA data centers in Texas and Utah, the open source world is already almost there.  All we need are some further improvements in Tails and cryptographic applications.

Please note that whatever one thinks of the US government, US TLAs may share information with the intelligence services of governments which even the U.S. State Department would probably agree violates the human rights of citizens.  And by way of the infamous revolving door, US TLA employees may subsequently or simultaneously work in private surveillance companies such as Gamma International, which (intentionally or not, knowingly or not) appears to provide malware to governments such as the Assad government, which the US government is now accusing of using Sarin nerve gas against its own citizens.

We imagine that Julian A would appreciate a recursive aspect of our whistle-blowing scenario: currently one of the \"most-needed\" leaks are traces from infection by state-sponsored malware.  May we hope to soon see reverse-engineered CIPAV code appear in Wikileaks?

Please note that persons in Kenya, Mexico, etc. are among those with valuable information to disclose, and they have a need to evade NSA eavesdropping.
