>Were the files you deleted located on an actual volume (i.e., a removable USB drive, SD card, or an internal hard drive)?

If yes, had you emptied the trash before re-starting Tails?

If you didn't, and if when you rebooted Tails you mounted the volume from which you had deleted the files, then that would probably explain what happened.

>Hidden .trash directory on your USB stick?

Tip: The \"Show hidden files\" setting (in Nautilus, the file manager in Tails) can be toggled with **ctrl+H**
