Toshiba Satellite Pro Laptop, boots up fine and everything looks good. Only it says "No Network Connection" when I click the icon.
Like me its getting on a bit but works fine through my Netgear Router with no problems. Can only imagine as it dates back to about 2003 that Debian does not recognise the wifi card.

Any ideas guys
Regards Cliff
