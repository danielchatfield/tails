How do you watch videos or handle any downloads safely while using Tor? On the tor website is mentioned doing it with a disconnected computer, how do you do that? It also recommended a virtual box which I have heard bad things about. I also heard it is recommended to watch videos offline somehow, How do you do that? Just wanna know the best and safest way to do this while staying anon. If someone could provide a step by step walkthrough on that it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
