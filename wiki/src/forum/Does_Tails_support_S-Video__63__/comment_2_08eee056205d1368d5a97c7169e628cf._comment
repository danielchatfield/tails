OP reporting:

Ok. I dwelled into this further and turned out to be an already fixed bug in Debian.

Although the cable is connected at both ends yet running this:

#xrandr -q

shows this:

#S-video disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

Also tried this:

#xrandr --output S-video --set \"load detection\" 1

Came out with no errors, but still S-Video shows disconnected.

Hopefully if someone knows how to apply the available patch to this bug it would be appreciated coz I dont know how.
