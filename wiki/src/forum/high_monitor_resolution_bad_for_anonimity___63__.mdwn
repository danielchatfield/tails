Hi, thanks for all the work that goes into making and updating Tails !

I've been wondering for a while if the fact that Tails uses the native resolution couldn't be used to help break one's anonmity ? Different users would have different screen resolutions, and the size of Iceweasel's window would be different too.

In particular, I have a big screen, so I would easily stand out.

Is there anything in Tails that mitigates this issue ?
