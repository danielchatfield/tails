Hi. Please run the following command and paste its output here:

`cat /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/{idVendor,idProduct,manufacturer,product}`

It will tell us exactly what (internal and external) USB devices are plugged-in.
Make sure you plug only your mobile dongle in order not to leak too much information.
