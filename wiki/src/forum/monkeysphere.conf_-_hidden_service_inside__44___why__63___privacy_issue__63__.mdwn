in:

~/.monkeysphere

there is a file called monkeysphere.conf.

inside the file is a line pointing to an .onion hidden service, as a "key server".

I attempted to connect to it via Iceweasel but it failed.

What is the purpose of this and is this a privacy leak issue?

Other users, check for yourselves to confirm this and post here.
