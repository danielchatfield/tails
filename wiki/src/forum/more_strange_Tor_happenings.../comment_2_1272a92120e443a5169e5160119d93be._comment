There could have been a burst of solar radiation at about the same time.

EMF shielding can cost several hundreds, no guarantee it would work either.

In the early days of Tor some of the advice I read included to maintain a list of trusted relays, there being tor settings to restrict which relays to use (including which entry and possibly also exit relays to use).

One day I will get the hang of carrying out a mini forensic investigation when these things happen.

There is an Art to using tor!
