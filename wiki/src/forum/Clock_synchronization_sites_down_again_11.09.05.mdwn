So the clock synchro sites were down again yesterday (11.09.05). Is there documentation in TAILS that give us a work around or is this TOR and TAILS house of cards? Basically, if we can't synchro our clock, Vidalia doesn't work, then neither does Tor as we can't get out. Is TAILS really this flawed or is there a faq I'm unable to find that shows us the way passed this weak link? Thanks.
