I know Liberte Linux chains i2p with tor by default, but that's the other way around.  All connections to the i2p network go via Tor first I think.

If I understand you correctly, you are asking if it is possible to configure things so that outbound traffic goes via Tor to the i2p network and then out one of i2p's exit nodes to the clearnet?  

Interesting idea as a possible optional configuration for double-banger super anonymity.  Might be pretty slow surfing, perhaps that would be acceptable for some.
