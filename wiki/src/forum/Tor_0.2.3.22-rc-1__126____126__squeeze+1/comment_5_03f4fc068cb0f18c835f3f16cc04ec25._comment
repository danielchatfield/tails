> An answer from similar thread: ... and the \"stable\" version is taking a greater gamble because that one has holes that are well known?

I guess you have a point. Tor .39 was released 61 days ago, while .24-rc came out just 17 days ago. 
I am not a software developer so I obviously do not know the answer to this question. Release candidates contain patches not found in the stable release, but may also contain bugs and security holes. So I guess it is always a tradeoff. You'll always be taking a gamble.
