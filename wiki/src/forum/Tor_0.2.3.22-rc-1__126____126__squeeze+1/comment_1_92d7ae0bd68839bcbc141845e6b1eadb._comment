> I was wondering what \"~~squeeze+1\" means here?

It's part of the version number. Basically, it means \"backported
for Squeeze\". See the Debian Policy and `--compare-versions` in
`dpkg(1)` for details.

> Also, and I think this was discussed in another thread, according to the Tor blog \"all users who were using Tor 0.2.3.22-rc1 are strongly encouraged to upgrade.\" Since Tor 0.2.3.22-rc-1 is bundled with Tails 0.14-rc2 (and possibly with stable 0.14) does this mean Tails users are at risk?

Final 0.14 will have an updated Tor.
