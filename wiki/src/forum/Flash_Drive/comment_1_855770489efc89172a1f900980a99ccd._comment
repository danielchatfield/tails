I'm not sure I understand your question correctly but a USB stick with Tails installed has typically two partitions: the first one, labeled \"Tails\" is a FAT partition without encryption and containing the operating system, the second one, labeled \"TailsData\" is an encrypted ext3 partition and used for [[/doc/first_steps/persistence]].

When I plug a Tails USB stick in my everyday Linux system I can open both the \"Tails\" partition and the \"TailsData\" (after giving its passphrase). If you're on Windows you might be able to open the encrypted partition using [FreeOTFE](http://www.freeotfe.org/).
