Had no problem d/l and install tails in usb stick, runs fine.  Only problem is the screen/desktop occupies only the upper left corner of the monitor and is very small.  Screen resolution is low, and cannot be reset within tails (only one option shown under preferences, 760 X 480(?) I believe)  I tried to adjust using hardware buttons on the monitor which is a samsung syncmaster plugged into NVidia GE Force mx4000 video card.  How can I get the screen to expand to use full monitor size?
