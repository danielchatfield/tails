Tails blocks all network except Tor & I2P. But, my host OS does not have those restrictions. I thought making switch to google public dns (on non-tails host) might help add some level of privacy control for application or background services(on non-tails host) which are not torified.

Until Tails becomes a full blown distribution(instead of only livecd) i am stuck with having \"non-Tails host running Tails in VM\" setup.
