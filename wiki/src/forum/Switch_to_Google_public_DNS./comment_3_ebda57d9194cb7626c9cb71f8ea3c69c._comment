[[Not in Tails|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement#index1h1]].

It'll be safe since Tails will [[prevent the **in the clear** connections|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement#index3h1]] to Google's DNS from ever leaving your computer (so you will break DNS, but since you don't leak anything it *is* safe). If I understand what you suggest correctly, you want to enforce DNS leaks, which makes me wonder if you actually know what your are talking about (no offense).

If you are the thread starter, you wrote:

Let's say that Google claims that they do. Why should we trust what they say? Why not use Tor's DNS resolution which is designed to provide privacy?
