> Does Tor's DNS resolution do about the same thing as OpenDNS's DNScrypt? If so, then why does OpenDNS claim its DNScrypt is a MITM solution when Tor, and Tails, does not make that claim?

Tor's DNS resolution has no extra protections against MitM. It's only normal DNS resolution + anonymity. Well, it has an additional security property that at least makes a difference: it's distributed, so to completely compromise all of Tor's DNS resolution, every Tor exit node would have to be compromised or MitM:ed when *they* perform the DNS resolutions for the Tor network. In contrast, OpenDNS (or any other individual provider) only have a handful of servers that need to be compromised.
