> I haven't been able to connect to any obfsproxy bridge since upgrading to 0.18. Do you still add the bridge the same way in Tor setting?

Yes, it should work the same way. Perhaps your bridge went down -- have you tried and confirmed your obfsproxy bridge still works with 0.17.2?

> Also, sometimes when I boot up 0.18, it thinks I'm still using 0.172

\"It\" is probably right, and your upgrade probably wasn't as successful as you think.
Anyway, let's not mix this in the same thread.
