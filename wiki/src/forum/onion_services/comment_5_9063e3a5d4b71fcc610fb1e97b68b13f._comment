Tails, I was trying an expermiment; that could be blamed on bordom. Could I access .onion through the startpage.com proxy? If so, everything would be https, which would bypass any MITM.

It of course didn't work because .onion needs to know of the Tor access, and the startpage.com proxy denies that knowledge to the Tor servers.

However, in the process I found the onion.to link to the Hidden Wiki, and that appears to be a hijack and all traffic would go through the .to domain, whatever that is, and could be logged.

A startpage search will most often hit on the onion.to site when searching for the wiki. That could be very dangerous IF the onion.to is a honey pot of sorts.

Anonymous, you're right, the real Hidden Wiki link you provided does not go to that onion.to page and its Hidden Wiki page warning page.

So what I learned while bored is to not trust what could appear to be the real Hidden Wiki address. That little .to can make a big difference. Very clever. Of course, it could be legit but then why go to all that trouble if so?

IOW, perhaps when experimenting to bypass a MITM I inadvertenly subcribed to the MITM via the onion.to address. Funny.
