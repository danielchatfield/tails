Also, even with magnetic media (ordinary mechanical hard disks), wiping *free space* has a number of limitations and potential vulnerabilities. This is especially true for any **journalling** file system (ext3,ext4, NTFS)

Even with a *non-journalling* file system (ext2, FAT), within any operating system environment, all kinds of data often gets saved in any number of far-reaching places. As I understand it, if the stakes are high enough, one should rely on nothing less than a complete overwriting of the *entire* device or partition on which any sensitive data had resided.
