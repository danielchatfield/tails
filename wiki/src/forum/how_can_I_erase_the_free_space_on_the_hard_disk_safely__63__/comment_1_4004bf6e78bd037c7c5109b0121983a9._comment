You mean an SSD? (i.e. \"solid state\" flash chips rather than a disc?)

The recommendations vary slightly for different types of device, so we need to be sure what you're using. ;o)

Would you feel comfortable telling us the make & model?

Alternatively, there's [a page in the docs](https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion/index.en.html) which provides a good place to start investigating this yourself.
