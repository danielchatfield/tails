1.) Only **one pass** should ever be necessary. See [The Urban Legend of Multipass Hard Disk Overwrite](http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/16130-The-Urban-Legend-of-Multipass-Hard-Disk-Overwrite.html)

2.) For making data irrecoverable, using zeroes should be just as effective as random or pseudo-random data.

3.) If a drive is to be *encrypted*, however, first filling it with at least *pseudo-random* data is advised (to make attacks on the *encryption* more difficult).

Huh?! 

Parted Magic comes with a program called `Erase Disk` that makes it very easy to zero-out a drive with `dd`, `shred` or `ATA secure erase`.
 
I don't see how any one of these (or anything else PartedMagic contains) would deal with the problem that solid state media (SSD or flash media) presents, which [b]wear-levelling[/b] ( see: [SSDs prove difficult to securely erase | Naked Security](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/02/20/ssds-prove-difficult-to-securely-erase/)
