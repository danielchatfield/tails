As I understand it, to securely erase an entire SSD block device is no problem at all. For example simply using `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdw` to overwrite an entire device with \"zeros\" will ensure that every bit is written to, regardless of any wear levelling shenanigans. The SSD problem afflicts selective erasure - such as attempting to securely delete individual files.
