Fill/overwrite free space:

dd if=/dev/zero of=fillfile

This will not clear all space unless run as root, so rather:

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=fillfile

This will overwrite all free data with zeroes, removing any removed files from the logical mapping, and for magnetic disks most likely also physically.

Problems:
- It will not remove metadata, thumbnails and any other stuff
  your OS have cached in some databases somewhere.
  Sometimes your OS even have a full copy of your documents somewhere
  indexed for e.g. searching purposes.
- It will not remove the filename and associated info from
  the deleted file entry.
- It will not delete the files data physically on SSD disks or
  damaged magnetic disks.
- For magnetic disks another pattern than zeroes may or may not
  do a better job on removing the file data physically incase
  professional forensic hardware is used to try recovering data.

I have heard that the best way to remove any data from a SSD disk is by overwriting the whole SSD disk sequentially twice. It is important it is the whole disk, not just a partition on it.
THIS WILL DESTROY ALL DATA ON THE DISK (hopefully).

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda

(must be done from LiveCD, and replace /dev/sda with your actual disk).

Additionally, your disk may also have builtin secure erase functionality, but you have no guarantee it actually removes anything, and no guarantee it wont brick your disk, so I would advise against it.
