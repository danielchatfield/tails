http://view.samurajdata.se/ appears to be straight forward with no b.s. I'm thinking it would be a great idea if you could somehow provide the option in the browser to view PDFs and PostScript files online through this website? Maybe give the option somewhere in a right click way or some other, along with the ability to download the files instead. The site transforms most PDFs into readable images, it seems safe enough to me.
