If OP knew that his country doesn't mind killing activists/whistleblower user should have set up a relay with someone in another country to publish the video for him ; as long as no eyewitness saw him filming he'd be safe. Police killing poor farmers would have interested many media sites who would have procedures for safe encrypted and *private* file transfer. Facebook/Gmail/Hotmail use in Tails is just insane if you ask me, even if you're creating a new profile/account.

One more reason to use a trusted SSL VPN paid with bitcoins  --> Tor for people who live in hostile situations.

OP how do you know your ISP cut you off because of Tor use? Are you 100% sure thats the reason-ie did they notify you that you would be cut off because Tor is illegal in your country?

How do you know (not fear, know) there has been an attempt to trace you personally? The Minister declared publicly they were looking for you for not cooperating with their corrupt police is that it?

If anyone saw you filming the scene I'd take the whole family on a holiday asap, they might get the goons to try to remember faces that were present at the scene & if one of those faces saw you filming... :-/

Can you contact a trusted Human Rights lawyers group?

I really hope you stay underground & safe, thank you for your selflessness, corruption is the worst thing on earth. Then comes organized religion. Both are what prevent Earth from being paradise, coz for those leeches there's no money in paradise.
