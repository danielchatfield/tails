> Facebook/Gmail/Hotmail use in Tails is just insane if you ask me, even if you're creating a new profile/account.

I believe this is wrong.

To make sure we talk about the same thing.

Goal user: wants to create a new Facebook/Gmail/Hotmail/whatever account and upload something.

Goal Facebook/Gmail/Hotmail/whatever: want to find out the users identity.

Goal Tails: prevent anyone from finding out the users identity.

How does Tails fail? How does Facebook/Gmail/Hotmail/whatever find out the users identity?

Using phone verification is not a Tails fail. This happens outside of Tails and is a bit stupid. The user failed to read the documentation or if you want Tails not reached goal of a user interface to properly educate the user.
