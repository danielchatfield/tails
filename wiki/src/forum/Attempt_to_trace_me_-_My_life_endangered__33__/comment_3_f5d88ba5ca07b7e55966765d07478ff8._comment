It may not be entirely wise to publish all this information, that might help an attacker.

> Can I be traced 

If you're traced, I doubt this will be through your usage of Tor or Tails. Lacking offline operational security, and usage of a \"https proxy of Ukraine\", are much more likely ways to trace you (and are off-topic here). So, I'm sorry, but I don't think this forum can substantially help you :(

> is my life really endangered?

I don't think anyone on this forum should even try to pretend they have a beginning of a good answer to that. You're in the best position to know, and anything else will be pure speculation.
