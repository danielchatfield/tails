///Facebook/Gmail/Hotmail use in Tails is just insane if you ask me, even if you're creating a new profile/account.//

THEN WHAT KIND OF SERVICE SHOULD WE USE?


//OP how do you know your ISP cut you off because of Tor use?//

//Are you 100% sure thats the reason-ie did they notify you that you would be cut off because Tor is illegal in your country?//

ISP blocked TOR for the whole country and not only for me. So no subscriber of that internet connection can use TOR in the country.


///How do you know (not fear, know) there has been an attempt to trace you personally? The Minister declared publicly they were looking for you for not cooperating with their corrupt police is that it?//

The minister announced that they want to trace me to get the real perpetrators identified whereas I know that he had said so just to use the legal machinery (police and goverment) to contact the other countries to supply them the data in the garb of social welfare or in the interest of society. But their real intention is to eliminate me.


//If anyone saw you filming the scene I'd take the whole family on a holiday asap, they might get the goons to try to remember faces that were present at the scene & if one of those faces saw you filming... :-///

NO, NOBODY SAW ME CAPTURING THE VIDEO BECAUSE i WAS SITTING INSIDE MY CAR when I shot it with hi-resolution video camera.
