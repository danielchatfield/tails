When I use bridges, in Vidalia's Message Log/Advanced area, it will say:

    Learned fingerprint - fingerprint - name - IP

After an hour of use and with every hour on the hour that follows it will say:

    new bridge descriptor - 'name' - (fresh) - fingerprint - name - IP

This happened when I used bridges with TBB, and it's happening when I use bridges in Tails.

Why are the bridges added discovered as fresh on the hour every hour? I don't understand why known/added bridges are mysteriously rediscovered as fresh! Is this a MitM attack?
