Hi, Tails is using an in depth strategy in order to route all the outgoing
traffic through Tor. First, the main applications: web browser, email client,
instant messaging application, etc. are explicitly configured to use Tor but on top of that there is also a firewall that works as a transparent proxy routing all outgoing traffic to go through Tor even if the corresponding application is not configured to do so.

As said before, 'ping' will not work in Tails but that would be the case if you'd use the 'ssh' command for example.
