Not really, but since we don't include `svn` in Tails there's little point to it. I instead suggest that you make `/home/amnesia/.subversion` [[persistent|doc/first_steps/persistence]] by adding that directory as a [[custom persistent directory|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#index10h2]] (requires that you run Tails (version 0.11 or higher) from a USB drive).
