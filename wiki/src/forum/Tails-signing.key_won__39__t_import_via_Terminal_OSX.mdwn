Typed the following commands in the Terminal (Mac OS 10.6.8): 

cd TailsStuff cat tails-signing.key | gpg --import 

and received the following output:

--bash" cd TailsStuff: No such file or directory
gpg: no vilid OpenPGP datat found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0

I was able to import the Signing Key into GPG Keychain Access (GPGTools), but still get the same messages in the Terminal, as noted above.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks.
