The problem with using Bittorrent over Tor is double:

- It's technically hard to do it properly, see: <https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea>.

- It harms the network, see: <https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow>. And this will be true whether or not you are using Tails. For this reason we decided not to support Bittorrent in Tails.
