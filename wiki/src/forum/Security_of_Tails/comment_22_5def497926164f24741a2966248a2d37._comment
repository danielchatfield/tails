I am new to Tails, and infosec in general. I usually use Windows 7 with a login password, and have lot of data on my laptop harddrives. The ease with which I (or anyone who got their hands on my laptop) could access my hard drives even though I have a Windows 7 login password, by simply using a Tails LiveCD is shocking (what comment 5 said). 
Now that I'm going through these comments, I'm just making a mental note of the possible solutions posted here to protect HDD leaks if someone gets unauthorized access..

-(Heise) modify the kernel so it doesn't initialize local harddrives in the first place

-Only allow certain Tails installations to access HDD data. That is, when you create a Tails LiveCD/USB from your laptop, you can only use that liveCD/USB to get access to hard disk data. No arbitrary Tails LiveCD/USB would work. In case you need to make another liveCD/USB, you have to use your first USB if you want hard disk access.

Anything else? (Sorry if I made any noob mistakes there. I AM a noob.)
