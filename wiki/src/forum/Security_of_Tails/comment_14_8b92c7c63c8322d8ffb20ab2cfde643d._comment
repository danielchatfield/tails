>I imagine setting the password like that would be of little benifit to \"security\".

As I understand it:
*Without* a password, anyone gaining remote access would be able to have all kinds of root access.

*With* a password, an attacker would have to know the password, so if it was strong enough, they would be out of luck.

>Same with unmounting filesystems, although this would be of no harm and could be considered wise for various reasons.

I would imagine that this is like most everything else in security:  A determined and expert enough attacker with enough resources probably can't be stopped but for everything short of that, there's a lot that can help.

In this case, the idea is to make it as difficult as possible for someone unauthorized to mount any drives.

>It'd come as quite a surprise to discover a drive-by exploit which could quietly pwn TAILS. I'm certainly not aware of anything \"in the wild\". Anyone know different? 

Have you had a look at any of the \"Numerous security holes in [the deprecated version of TAILS]\" posts?

Also, TAILS is not exactly so famous that you would expect to hear about it each and every time someone exploited it.

And, finally, remember the old saying, \"There's a first time for everything\"...
