I would likte to hear your oppinion to the following:

Would it be secure if I change the sudo password with \"passwd\" to an own one before I start browsing the internet? I have the impression that chaninging the root password does not change anything. I can still do things as root which I shuould not do without typing the password.

Furhtermore I could dismout all partition on which access should not be allowed.

What do you think? Or is there a problem??
