When I use TAILS (USB), it is mounted read only, and none of my hard drives are mounted, and are thus not vulnerable to a security threat. 

My normal use of TAILS include being able to download and store items to my hard drive.  After downloading an item of interest to be saved, I disable Networking, use sudo to become root,  mount the drive, save the item, then unmount the drive, and exit from root mode.

Please do not disable sudo root access in Tails 0.11 - it is unnecessary and would severly prohibit use of TAILS.
