\"unplugging hard-drives? seriously? how do you guys spend your days usually?\"

Yes, seriously. I spend my days in comfort knowing each LiveCD boot into individual sessions are unique, and nothing can communicate with my hard drives at all.

\"what's so bad with disabling initialization by kernel?\"

Simple disconnection of HDD cables will assure nothing is read/written from them unless there's some strange voodoo magic going on in tin foil hat country.

\"The system won't be able to locate the drives anymore\"

The system can be pwned in many ways including via RF/ethernet poisoning but most of the common people will say it's nothing to worry about, those are the people who should worry.

Flash drives and the better MicroSD cards, which you can stick in and pull out quickly, with optional but encouraged TrueCrypt containers or partitions is the way to travel.

If you're lap-topping it, unplug the power cord from the wall and run only on battery with wireless disabled when you type in passwords for your system (and especially encryption passwords) so you're not generating sniff-able key presses via power line and through the air (even with wireless disabled, wired keystrokes can be captured through the air).
