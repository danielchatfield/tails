What exactly is the threat you're planning to mitigate? Is the \"unauthorised access\" you envisage local or remote? i.e: 

1. Some remote exploit being used to pwn your Tails session and thus compromise your Win7 data?

2. Someone with physical access to your machine using your Tails DVD to access your Win7 data?

If your concern is remote (1) then... you should probably be more worried about the adversary compromising your Windows(tm) session directly. There are **always** multiple widely known, \"critical\" vulnerabilities available, unpatched and ready to exploit, in *every* version of Windows. Many of them have been common knowledge for *years*! PCs running fully up-to-date installations of Windows are being pwned en-mass every day. As far as I'm aware, remote pwnage of Tails is unheard of. That said, improbable!=impossible so if you've chosen to use a live distro to perform some freakishly high-risk activity (hacking into Kim Jong Un's goatse pr0n stash perhaps?) then you should probably take extra precautions to (at least) secure the disks and BIOS from tampering. ...that said, why use a machine loaded with sensitive/valuable data to do something insanely dangerous? Wouldn't you be better off picking up a cheap machine (from eBay perhaps) and dedicating it to the task.

If the threat is local (2) then you're buggered. Your adversary could boot any system they choose to bring with them, launch a rainbow table attack against your Windows password if they feel inclined, install all manner of hardware and/or software logging devices, etc. If someone adversary *may* have attained access to a machine holding sensitive data then do not attempt to boot it: remove the storage media, destroy everything else, then cautiously commence data recovery using fresh clean hardware.

Either way you should be aware that account passwords are no defence at all against an adversary with root privileges, whether achieved via physical access or some remote privilege-escalation attack. That's why we need encryption. To keep your private stuff private, yet accessible from assorted OSs, keep it in a Truecrypt volume ;-)
