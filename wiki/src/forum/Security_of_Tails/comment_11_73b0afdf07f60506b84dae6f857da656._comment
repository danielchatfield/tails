>Not really. Full root access via an empty password is quite easily exploitable in a short shell script that an attacker just has to fool the user to run. Root access can be used to dismantle any protection we've setup. The possibilities of ownage are endless.

Of course, I just thought this was unlikely to have actually happened - hence \"theoretical\". I imagine the average Tails user is probably too savvy/paranoid to go 'round running untrusted scripts without at least looking them over first!... Or are you aware of an actual occurance of this???
