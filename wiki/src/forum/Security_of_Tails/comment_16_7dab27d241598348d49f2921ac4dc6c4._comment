I forgot: 

It seems like a classic catch-22: Safest to not have any drives mounting while connected to the Internet, esp. Tor and the like, but... what if you need to download files?

If you have enough RAM and the files are small enough, then you could simply copy them from the RAMFS , after disconnecting but before shutting down TAILS. 

But in many cases, the size of files will very quickly exceed any available space in the RAMFS.

I suppose the best one can do is to mount (and ideally only *connect*) a separate, clear volume each time that has no sensitive data already on it. And certainly that is partitioned completely separate from any system files.  And then to carefully examine all the downloaded files after each time, and even open them in a live or virtual environment before doing anything else with them.
