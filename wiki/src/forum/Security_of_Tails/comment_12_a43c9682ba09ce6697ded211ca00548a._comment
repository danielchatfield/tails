I really like the sound of a kernel which doesn't even initialize the system's disks. I wonder if it might be plausible for Tails to provide two kernels... selectable at boot time?

In fact, I'd envisage a choice between *three* kernels:

* Standard multifunction kernal as now (default)
* No HDD kernel
* No network kernel

Any thoughts anyone?

I find this <https://tails.boum.org/forum/Encrypted_Usb_Tails_/#comment-a76e0ea52b7929b890274d3514aa9f94> to be an altogether better approach to running from USB (or HDD).
