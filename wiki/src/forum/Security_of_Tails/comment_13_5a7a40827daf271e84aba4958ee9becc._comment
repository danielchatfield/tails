excellent idea!! going to try it soon, thank you very much.

Do you have the bash-command for installing grub on the flashdrive handy?
And i suppose you're using singlepartition/fat32?

How do you think about persistence? 
this will be very important to me once tails offers it, because i need certain packages like  W I N E  all the time. what do you think?


not wanting to do more advertising for heise, but for verifying if /boot was modified every startup, they made a simple script using sha1-(or whatever you prefer)-checksums. might work on the bootloader too if you'd export it with *dd*...

(ftp with tor, always a pain in the ass, sorry)


I'm with you on the no-network kernel, as a system to just work on private stuff offline, and afterwards it clears the ram, is very handy (despite the dangers of possible hardware keyloggers or such?), even if it's not the idea of tails.

But i wouldn't have access to HDD ever, since that leads anonymity ad absurdum. Not just for the data on it but for supplying more unique system identifiers.
