Do they even have to \"fool\"? Aren't there ways of sneaking the script in?

Please forgive me for asking why it took so long to do something about this.

Also, what about if all the attached drives/volumes are *encrypted*? Would that still be a risk (assuming strong passwords)?

How vulnerable is the (necessarily) unencrypted /boot sector to attack?

Finally, if someone's user password is strong and not shared with anyone, would \"sudo\" really be any less secure than \"su\"?

Oh, one last thing... isn't anyone concerned about BIOS or other *hardware* rootkits?
