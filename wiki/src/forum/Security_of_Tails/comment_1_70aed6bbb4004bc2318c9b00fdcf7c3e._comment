Don't *ever* trust anyone who tells you something is *really secure*.
There's no such thing as perfect security.

This [[will change|todo/better_root_access_control]] in Tails 0.11.

The best we can do in this area is probably to:

1. disable root access by default (will be the case in Tails 0.11)
2. harden the system somehow (being done in Debian)
3. reduce exposure time to known security issues, thanks to
   [[todo/incremental_upgrades]]
4. more ideas?
