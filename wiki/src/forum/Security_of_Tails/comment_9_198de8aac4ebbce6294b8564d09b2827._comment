renominated german magazine c't developed a live-ubuntu-distribution \"c't Surfix\" with the goal for high security:
 The most important point about it being, as they wrote, that they ***modified the kernel so it doesn't initialize local harddrives in the first place***, as if they were not built in at all. (issue 26/2011, page 150+)

imo tails runs much more convenient, surfix is, despite coming from an established, professional house, not a very good live distribution, aimed more at the casual noob. But once i've read about the harddrive part, i was all fire and flames for their approach.


Maybe you want to look into the distribution. Page and article i found in german only, sadly. They didn't exactly write how they modified the kernel, if you want to i can give you the mail of the editor though.


One of my biggest concerns with Tails security so far:

- Free access to the harddrives so far, ofc
- the ***serial number of the harddrive, or other*** macs/imei/serials that can could possibly be ***related to me***, or where i bought my stuff. 
(- no system encryption to prevent tails from being modified from outside while usb-stick is laying around)

Any thoughts about this?
