AS the subject states; I'm having a problem with using Tails ; Tor to become a TOR - Relay, Middle Relay - Not an exit node. Just to clear up any misunderstandings.. heh..


Any ideas? Yes behind router, Yes Ports are frwd'.. Yes, its a virtual server to the correct host pc's ip address.
Just cant seem to get the TOR Relay to work at all.. Any ideas? Thanks.


Also, Side note/ question rather.. Is IPtables used to take care of all the traffic routing? Ive noticed few app's dl'd , installed. no proxy config has been needed and yet piggy backs onto tor. How does that work?
Thanks
 Devon
