Nothing new here: if the Torified application doesn't adhere to the proxy settings, leaking can break Tor. Such leaks are not possible in Tails though (see [[contribute/design/Tor_enforcement]]).

Again, nothing new here: Tor, by design, doesn't protect against end-to-end correlation attacks. It's outside of its threat model and hence not a problem with Tor.

This has been addressed on the [Tor blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough).

It should be noted that the two attacks only make it possible for the malicious exit nodes to see when a user that previously used the exit returns. While serious, the user isn't deanonymized (e.g. the IP address isn't reveiled to the exit), only correlated to previous sessions. It further shows the importance of authentication (the first attack is based on HTTP injection which doesn't work with HTTPS) and encryption (the second attack is based on classifying users based on their HTTP headers, which are encrypted in HTTPS), and a common fingerprint (to thwart the second attack; this is what Torbutton/Tor Browser is for).

Disclaimer: I just skimmed the last paper very quickly, so I may be way off. But it certainly seems that the paper doesn't explore anything really new nor presents any attack that is more powerful than the currently known attacks.
