Yes, I know, checksums *alone* cannot verify authenticity. 

But they can be somewhat useful as *one* of *several* indicators....and since *no* method alone can truly be 100% failsafe, etc....

(If a consensus is built and someone finds their sums differing from the consensus, then it would be cause for concern)

So let's compare our checksums for 
**tails-i386-0.14~rc2.iso**

Mine:

**BEFORE running `isohybrid` command[1]**:

SHA256:
`22a25e2c743993ab89e1d74abcfee6d8fab7ac8cc8265049e998f6861ecb4b77`

SHA1:
`2ffc9b48c6042537be0b7777bd3287e4d0539d63`

MD5:
`23527e6610df3ed8a4f552d36bcfdc6d`

**AFTER `isohybrid` command[1]**:

SHA256:
`5cb6d273709a77d523bec7b0664e74738e3afd8720e6bb5ae4c117a01bdd20dc`

SHA1:

MD5:
`fa7a2d799da917366794aef6fb9eeb25`

NOTES:
[1]`isohybrid` command as found in the TAILS documentation, instructions for manually installing ISO to USB:
`isohybrid tails-i386-0.14~rc2.iso --entry 4 --type 0x1c`
