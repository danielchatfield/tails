According to:

https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-bundles-security-release

posted on September 12th, 2012, "All of the available bundles of Tor have been updated for the latest stable Tor 0.2.2.39 release and the 0.2.3.22-rc release. These releases fix a remote crash bug found in Tor and all users and relays are STRONGLY encouraged to update immediately."

I understand by reading here the next version of Tails will be what two versions now of Tor behind? If all users are STRONGLY encouraged to update, this new stable version of Tor should be included in the next version of Tails. If it's not, I will switch away and encourage others to switch too as security for Tails should be priority #1!

So, will the next version of Tails include Tor 0.2.2.39 or not?
