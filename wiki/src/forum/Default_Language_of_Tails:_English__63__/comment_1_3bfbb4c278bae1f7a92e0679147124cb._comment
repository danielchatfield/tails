> it has something to do with Unetbootin?

Yes. This bug does not happen on Tails installed in the documented and supported way. It indicated unetbootin messes with Tails boot menu (and, possibly, boot options) in random ways. If it messes too much with boot options, the end-result may be a modified Tails that does not offer some of the security properties we are trying to built in it.
