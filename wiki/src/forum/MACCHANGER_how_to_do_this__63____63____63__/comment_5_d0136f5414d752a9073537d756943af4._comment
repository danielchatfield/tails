@2: Why would it be necessary to disable WiFi? 

Why couldn't you just not connect to a network until after you had changed your MAC?

@4: I picked-up the following and it has worked for me. 

Note:

-In order to use macchanger you will need to set a password upon booting Tails, as root privileges are required. Gain them either by entering `sudo su` into the terminal first, or by preceding each command with `sudo`.

- You may need to replace \"wlan0\" in the commands below with whatever your actual network interface may be. The `ifconfig` command can be used to generate a list of all network interfaces.

`ifconfig wlan0 down`

`macchanger -a -e wlan0`

`ifconfig wlan0 up`
