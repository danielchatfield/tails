I thought your mac adress leaks before even connecting to a network? If not it would not be a problem. But the thing is that when you open tails your adress is already leaked.. 

With your command ifconfig wlan0 down , does wifi shut down compelety on tails? Because then i could do this:
ifconfig wlan0 down 
change the mac adress
go the a public wifiplace
ifconfig wlan0 up

that way my original mac adress is not leaked right?
