@tails

But a solution would be: start tails at home where a leaking mac adress is no problem because it is leaked 100 times. Do ifconfig wlan0 down so wifi is disabled.

Then you change the mac adress and go to a public wifi, then you do ifconfig wlan0 up. 

This way your original mac adress is not leaked anywhere except near your house, but that is no problem.
