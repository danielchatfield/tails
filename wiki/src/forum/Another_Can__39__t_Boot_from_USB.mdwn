So I read through others similar problems and have not been able to fix mine.

I deleted Liberte from my USB, reformatted (FAT).

Downloaded Tails 0.11

Created a DVD from the iso

Booted said DVD, which booted fine, used application > Tails to create my USB with Clone as the option. It installed fine. 

I safely removed USB then shutdown.

Rebooted, went to BIOS and changed USB to my boot option 1.

It loaded the Debian splash, then went to a white/blue loading bar for Debian. When this completes (all white) it just sits there. I tried this several times, the last time leaving it sit for 20 minutes.

Came here and read through the threads and found one solution of hitting tab at the debian splash page and typed "vga=0x314 nomodeset" hit enter and it loaded the bar but still hangs as before.

Also, not sure if it's related to this problem or not, if I reboot it will not load to the debian screen it just sits on a black screen unless I boot into bios each time and save&exit then it boots to the debian splash.
