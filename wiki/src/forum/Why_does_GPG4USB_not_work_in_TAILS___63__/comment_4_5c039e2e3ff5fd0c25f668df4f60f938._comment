Commenter #1 here.  I agree with #3.  

1. Save your keys to a text file with a name like .asc or .bgp at the end.  
2. When you want to use a key just double click on its file name and it will automatically get put into Tails until you reboot.  
3. Copy and paste encrypted text into gedit (the default Tails editor).
4. Use \"Edit\" in the menu bar to sign, encrypt and decrypt coded text.
