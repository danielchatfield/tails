I fear GPG4USB won't work inside Tails.

You should instead use GnuPGP, the free software implementation of OpenPGP that is included in Tails.

You can also read the documentation pages related to its usage:

  - [[/doc/encryption_and_privacy/openpgp_passphrase_encryption/]]
  - [[/doc/encryption_and_privacy/openpgp_with_gedit/]]
