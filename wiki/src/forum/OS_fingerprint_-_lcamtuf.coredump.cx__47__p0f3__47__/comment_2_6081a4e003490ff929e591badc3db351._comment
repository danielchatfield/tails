Not OP

Regarding Tails fingerprint, which is (at least a little) different from TBB because of Adblock-Plus. Does this work the other way around? Can I install Adblock-Plus on my TBB knowing that it the end it is mostly ok as it will look similar to Tails fingerprint?

Or does Tails Adblock-Plus have special configurations or needs a special way to talk to the rest of the browser? I guess in the end I just *really* want to get rid of those adds in TBB and it takes too long to boot tails for everyday internet usage. Does the user end up with a choice this way? Can I do it or do I need \"Dev skills\"?

If not, could tails (or tor I guess) consider to provide the modified Adblock and instruction on how to do install it on TBB? I think it could also help both TBB and Tails fingerprint if tor decided to ship a modified Ad-block which blocked adds at a 1-click distance.
