A great deal of information is available thanks to intrepid journalists who infiltrated international trade fairs sponsored by the \"lawful intercept\" industry, which sells hi-tech surveillance gear to governments, including the most authoritarian ones, corporations, including the nastiest ones, and other well-funded organizations.  Some of the leaked documents have been published by major journalism organizations such as Wikileaks, The Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and Bloomberg News.

It is possible to give a broad outline of how modern electronic surveillance typically works, on the evidence of marketing documents produced by companies which sell \"whole population surveillance systems\" targeting entire countries, such as:

* Aqsacom SA (customers worldwide with major offices in Paris, Washington, Melbourne, and Dubai); search for their whitepaper \"Lawful Interception for IP Networks\", March 2010

* Narus Inc (founded in Israel, but now a subsidiary of Boeing)

* NICE Systems Ltd (headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel)

* Septier Communications (headquartered in Petach Tikva, Israel)

* Thales (headquartered in Paris, with major offices in Ottawa and Washington); search for \"New Solutions for Massive Monitoring\", a 2008 presentation describing their country-scale \"communications intelligence exploitation centers\" and \"all source intelligence fusion\" centers\", which include kill switches and jamming capabilities,

*VASTech SA (headquartered in Technopark Stellenbosch, South Africa)

and companies which sell \"remote interception\", i.e. offensive malware intended for use by government agencies and large corporations, such as:

* Gamma International (customers worldwide, headquartered in Munich)

* Hacking Team (Italy); search for \"Remote Control System v5.1\", a 2007 presentation which frankly describes their flagship product like this: \"It is spyware.  It is a trojan horse.  It is a bug.  It is a monitoring tool.  It is an attack tool.  It is a tool for taking control of the endpoints, that is, the PCs.\"

* Vupen Security (headquartered in Montpelier); search for \"Exploits for Law Enforcement Agencies\", a marketing flier leaked in 2008, which explains Vupen's \"exploit as a service\" business model by saying \"While social engineering or physical access is often used by law enforcement agencies and investigators to gain access to computer systems and install monitoring and interception tools on target PCs or mobile devices, using 0-day exploits taking advantage of previously unknown software vulnerabilities can help investigators in speeding up the process when covertly and remotely installing payloads on PCs and mobiles\".  Their words, not mine.

All of these companies emphasize that their surveillance products operate \"transparently\" (i.e. invisibly) to the targeted citizens.

Some major points about interception generally:

* In some places there is still a legal distinction between intelligence data collection and police interception of communications, but following the US lead most \"Western\" countries have virtually erased this distinction.  In \"Western democracies\", most major police organizations include \"intelligence divisions\", and these can be sizable and capable organizations, sometimes with an international reach.  For example, the homegrown intelligence agency inside the NYPD is said to maintain a presence in places like Munich and Paris, and to be larger than all the intelligence agencies operated by Canada put together.

* There has been a marked trend during the past decade towards considering all citizens guilty by default, following the lead of the USA (despite the \"innocent until proven guilty\" tradition of common law, the model employed in US jurisprudence).  The universal goal of both government and commercial snoops is to collect and store everything they can grab indefinitely, on the theory that if they can't use it now, it might come in handy later.  Fortunately, so far the reality tends to fall short of that goal, but the hunger for big data appears so irresistible that the Panopticon is becoming every day in every way more and more an mundane reality.  But no less oppressive and dangerous for being \"ordinary\".

* There is a great variety of different infrastructure, protocols, hardware, software, etc involved in different modes of communication.  Different modes afford snoops varying levels of easy access to various kinds of information.

* Interception and collection typically results in a grab-bag of data which is not always \"ideal\" from the snoop perspective, but one general principle always favors the snoops: data which are useless in isolation become powerful in combination.  For example, commercially collected APR (automatic license plate reader) data, or cell tower geolocation data can be combined with traces  associated with a communication by an activist or whistleblower to reduce a huge list real life identities to a manageable list of suspects, whose vehicles might then be tagged with an underbody GPS beacon, or whose laptops and mobile phones might be targeted with police malware.

* The most convenient sources of data which is invaluable for fleshing out bits of intercepted data are often not police or intelligence agency files but the international commercial data brokers.  Essentially all police and intelligence agencies and organized crime groups appear to purchase or steal large volumes of personal information from data brokers, often including information on persons living well outside their jurisdictions, or working outside the professions traditionally considered targets for espionage (such as journalists, government workers, aerospace and communication engineers, and military personnel).

* Broadly speaking, the kinds of information sought by snoops includes personally identifying information (PII), metadata. and communications content.  The Aqsacom document mentions username, MAC address, phone number or cable modem identifier, external IP address and possibly internal ethernet address as examples of PII sought by adversaries.  Information provided by customers when they sign up with ISPs, public libraries, or cybercafes, is also routinely obtained by police, private investigators, and intelligence agencies, often without a warrant, and often on a massive scale.

* Metadata can include services used, access levels, timestamps of various events tied to the user, geolocation, urls accessed by the user's web-browser, phone numbers called.  Metadata associated with emails includes chains of IP addresses showing what path the email took from point A to point B, email client port, login names of senders and recipients, byte counts, unique message ID, and when and if the email was received or read.  

* Content information is self-explanatory, but the Aqsacom document says that in \"Western\" countries, the webmail provider or ISP is responsible for decrypting encrypted emails for police or intelligence agencies.  (Aqsacom recommends against simply inserting a bcc into the email headers, adding a snooper to the list of recipients, because alert users may notice the change; many activists now use \"web bugs\" of their own to detect incompetent snooping.)  In \"Western\" countries, almost all providers who offer mail servers for use by their customers have agreements with police and intelligence agencies to pass on emails to \"mediation servers\", for a flat rate fee.  The mediation servers are programmed to how to distribute  the \"intelligence product\" constructed from email interceptions.

* Any files uploaded by a user (such a picture posted on Facebook) can offer many additional opportunities for adversaries.  For example, digital cameras often attach to each snapshot timestamps, technical photographic data such as focal length, a unique identifier of the camera, even geolocation.

* Many websites include things like Facebook buttons which can be abused to help adversaries track even users who use Tor to try to evade tracking.  Noscript can help a lot with many of these, but we are all caught up in a nasty arms race pitting citizens against corporations and their various governmental clients.

* Broadly speaking, adversaries target all 7 layers in the OSI model.  These range from Layer 7 (application layer, often trivial to extract) to Layer 1 (hardware).  In particular, the MAC address at Layer 2 uniquely identifies each device, but this may not always be easily accessible to less capable adversaries.  However, if the adversary can coerce the ISP through which your device is currently connecting to the internet, your MAC address will become known to them.  In this way you can be re-identified when you move from your home or office to a public WiFI hotspot.

* The documents reveal interception of broadband traffic can and does occur at just about every place you might imagine: in surreptitiously installed keyloggers at the user's PC, in the \"first mile\" of \"PSTN wire\" (owned by a public switched telephone network, also known as your local phone company) between the user's location and the DSLAM, between the DSLAM and edge router and gateway of your ISP, inside the ISP's network, at a place such as \"internet hotel\" where internet traffic is handed over to another communications provider (Internet Exchanges are particularly dangerous for Tor users because the Tor Map can incorrectly suggest that two nodes are unlikely to be sharing information, when in fact your packets might be intercepted at both entry and exit by the same IX), in international undersea telecom cables, between microwave relay links, between earth-to-satellite links, inside fiber optic trunk lines, in webhost/webmail/cloud-backup networks, and in \"content delivery\" systems.   And don't forget that several governments operate surreptitiously in many countries, often engaging in such surreptitious operations as intercepting microwave relay links or faking cell towers. 

* Users who get on the internet using a dial-up modem can be targeted at the same points, except for the DSLAM.

* Most or all vulnerabilities also apply to WiFi communications, but websurfing from a laptop or smart phone or even a PC using a home WiFi router can be vulnerable in additional ways.  In particular, despite what you might have read recently about IMSI catchers, it has been common for many years for adversaries to use mobile devices which imitate cell towers in order to \"interrogate\" all cell phones (typically in an area of several square miles), in order to obtain thousands of real life identities which can be winnowed down by combining other data.  There are also devices which can quickly read stored data out of phones, such as a contact list, provided that a snoop can come within a short distance of the phone.  And of course, if you are talking on a cell phone in a cafe, you can be overheard.  (And parabolic microphones are used more often than most people realize.)

* An important point which is not yet appreciated by most people is that many interception techniques can be and are being rapidly \"married\" with unobtrusive police surveillance drones.  In particular, MAVs (small drones) can be and are used as fake cell phone towers.  In the next few years, it will become routine for police drones to carry thermal imaging cameras and perhaps radar systems capable of peering through roofs and walls, as well as high-definition video cameras and technology capable of interrogating RFID tags, and picking up signals from beacons and perhaps chemical \"taggants\" too.  For example, police chiefs are discussing visions like this: a plainclothes policeman surreptitiously dabs the shoulder of a target in a crowded demonstration, whose movements are then followed by a drone for several minutes, long enough for an \"arrest team\" to move into position.  Or the undercover agent hands the target a \"protest leaflet\" embedded with an invisible RFID tag, so that he can eventually be followed to his vehicle and identified, no warrant necessary.  Facial recognition technology can then be used by police drones to identify him again if he turns up at another demonstration.  

* Most military-industrial giants are deeply involved in country-level surveillance.  Many, such as Boeing, Thales, and several Israeli companies, manufacture both surveillance drones (including models intended for \"domestic use\" in urban environments) and electronic surveillance gear targeting ordinary citizens.  Some of them are working on insect sized drones which can fly into your home without being noticed, or small rolling surveillance robots which can be thrown in like a hand grenade.

* Also just a few years off: widespread deployment of remote biometric measurement devices which measure breathing, heart rate, and pupil gaze, which will be used by drones looking for people in a crowd who \"appear upset\" or \"unnaturally calm\", or when someone has been stopped by police, shoulder worn devices will examine the detainee for \"indications of deception\".  Police are even interested in acquiring MRI helmets for \"field interrogations\" which would literally scan your brain for \"indications of mal intent\".  In short, it is important not to focus exclusively on surveillance of electronic communications, lest you miss the forest for the trees.  Governments have always been potentially dangerous to the people they govern, but they are about to become dangerous to an unprecedented degree.

* VOIP services have been a particular concern for our adversaries, but unfortunately they now have many techniques for obtaining information from Skype and other providers.  Things got much easier for them after Skype was bought by Microsoft, which is one of the snoopiest mega-corporations of them all.  But its not all smooth sailing for VOIP snoops, so the Aqsacom paper recommends using \"probes\" which directly target the equipment owned by the user himself.

* Traditional VOP (voice operated phone) calls are typically teed by the phone company to the police or intelligence agency which want to listen in.  In many countries, there is a legal distinction between metadata such as geolocation and which numbers were called when, and the spoken communications themselves.  When laws prevent listening on the latter, it appears that intelligence agencies may arrange to have calls routed through another country, which then enables them to \"legally\" access both call data and spoken communications without a warrant.  Another subterfuge which some say has been widely employed is by resorting to the legal fiction that interception is an inadvertent consequence of \"routine testing\" that a telecom link is working properly.  When other methods fail, or when greater intrusion is desired, inexpensive listening devices are readily available for clandestine installation inside the user's home or office.

* Encryption of communications is slowly becoming more common, and when done properly can make things much harder for adversaries.  They have reacted by heavily promoting \"encryption in the cloud\".  Yes, Google's gmail is easy to obtain and use, and content of emails is stored encrypted on Google servers, and is probably encrypted in transport from their servers to your device, and maybe even in transit to your correspondent's own webmail provider.  But don't forget that Google can decrypt gmails for governments, and by their own statistics the requests for information has been skyrocketing.  (Good news for Google because they charge for providing decryption.)  In any case, Google extracts keywords from the plaintext content of all gmails, and sells \"anonymized\" data to data brokers.  And data which has been artificially \"anonymized\" can, all too often, all too easily be \"de-anonymized\", by, you guessed it, combination with non-anonymized data.

* Encryption, particularly SSL, is routinely directly attacked.  Search for \"Examining SSL-encrypted Communications\", a marketing document by Netronome touting a device which can be plugged into various \"internet choke points\" to study SSL \"protected\" data streams.

* Also common are \"poison pills\" disguised as governmental regulation, such as legislation mandating cooperation with digital-rights-management systems, content filtering systems, and \"protective\" systems like Green Dam Youth Escort (China), or mandating encryption backdoors (such as laws in India and Pakistan targeting Skype users).  These poison pills are typically disguised as anti-terrorism, anti-piracy, or anti-child-exploitation measures, or as measures intended to \"help\" providers authenticate their clients to prevent miscreants from stealing services (although the ISPs themselves universally say they don't need or want any such \"help\").

* A related topic which has received little media attention are international data brokers like ICF International, a little known company headquartered in Fairfax, VA, which perform tens of thousands of \"health surveys\" around the world.  ICF operates everywhere from Yemen to Pakistan to the two Koreas; in fact, ICF appears to be one of the few corporations which operates in every country on Earth, under cover of huge contracts with UN development agencies.  No matter where on Earth you live, no matter what language you speak, chances are good that ICF has contacted you, or will, under guise of some \"local government\" initiative.  What a gold mine for global snoopers; just imagine, a window into the state of health and state of mind of everyone on Earth.  A conjecture is obvious, but it is unnecessary to speak in terms of conjecture, because ICF makes no attempt to hide its deep ties to \"Western\" intelligence agencies.  One ICF subsidiary, GHK Pakistan, Plc, may even have played a role with the notorious fake \"vaccination program\" targeting the Bin Laden compound, a scandal which has been widely discussed in Pakistan.  The connection is still conjectural, as far as I know, but GHK Pakistan was working with very the clinics and NGOs implicated in that scandal, at the exact time of the fake \"vaccination drive\".  Just one more reason why all citizens everywhere should be suspicious of surveys and \"free services\".

* The trend is towards increasingly routine reliance on police malware which directly targets the users's own devices (PC, laptop, smart phone).  Malware sold by Western companies which specialize in surveillance gear may provide capability for directory transversal, password sniffers, screenshots, surreptitious hijacking of webcams, as well as keyloggers which can circumvent strong encryption.  The cutting edge appears to be malware which can allegedly remotely search the RAM of a running computer or server, looking for encryption keys and for files such as emails which may never have been saved to disk.  Obviously, tools like GPG are of no use if your computer has been compromised by such malware.

* The 2010 Aqsacom paper makes an interesting implicit admission when the authors remark that \"the LEA may resort to external interception when direct physical or legal access to the NWO/SP's networking is not possible\".  The authors also say that some ISPs resist illegal demands for blanket information; such resistance can always be overcome but it may be faster for adversaries to simply seek an easier path to our data.  So when our adversary can't easily obtain the information they want from our ISP, they will find another way, not necessarily legal. (In the quote LEA = law enforcement or intelligence agency, NWO = network operator, SP = service provider such as an ISP or telecom.)

Some Tor specific points:

* Anyone can operate a Tor router, and it doesn't take much skill to turn a Tor exit router into a rogue node which sniffs packets instead of (or in addition to) sending them on to their destination.  A few years ago a Swedish security researcher, Dan Egerstadt, ran five rogue Tor nodes for a few months, and collected clear text packets containing the login name and passwords of dozens of diplomats employed by the governments of Iran, India, among other countries, who were apparently using unencrypted connections to log into their embassy LAN from their residences.  When he divulged his findings, his home was raided by the Swedish government, allegedly at the behest of another Western government angered that their intelligence collection program had been \"blown\".  (All charges were dropped when government lawyers could find no laws which had been broken by Egerstadt; most governments are trying to close such loopholes by enacting legislation purposely written so vaguely that any government can charge any citizen they please.)

* Recently, CDN (content delivery network) giant Akamai introduced a large number of high bandwidth Tor servers which may well be involved in the already notorious anti-piracy efforts of major US telecoms.  

* Geolocation data is provided by Gnome applications (Tails is based on Debian stable, which uses Gnome as its default desktop environment).  Unfortunately, these applications are so deeply built into Gnome that they are almost impossible to turn off.  As far as I know, Tails has not been audited to check that this is not a potential problem for Tails users.
