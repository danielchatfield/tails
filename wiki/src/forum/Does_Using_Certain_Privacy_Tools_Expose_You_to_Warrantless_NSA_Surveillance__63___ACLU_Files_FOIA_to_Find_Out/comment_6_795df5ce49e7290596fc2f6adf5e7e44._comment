@ Comment 5: 

Thank you for that information!  It is good to know that this may not be nefarious after all.  (That said, many MIT academics have close ties to the US intelligence committee, so some persistent caution may be appropriate.  It is often hard not to cross the line from suspicion into rampant paranoia, which can become a crippling affliction.)

@ Comment 4:

Thank you for the appreciation!

There are some important general points I forgot to mention:

* If you carry a cell phone, a sophisticated adversary can still query its geolocation, or even silently turn it into a bug transmitting your conversations, even if you think the phone is \"off\", unless you remove the battery.  Of course, carrying a cell phone with its battery removed is in itself viewed as a \"potential terrorism indicator\", so choose your poison.
* If you use a laptop, you should be very aware of the distinction between power of, sleep mode, and other modes.  This could save your neck if your laptop is searched because encryption keys may be kept in memory even if you are not currently using encryption, or think your laptop is \"turned off\".  
* Many police agencies and private investigators have bought handheld devices designed to search cell phones and laptops during \"routine traffic stops\" or \"routine searches\" of public transit riders, so it is a good idea to know your rights (if any) under such circumstances.  Snoop journals are full of articles explaining how to search RAM for AES keys and so forth.  Twofish keys seem to be a bit harder to exploit, so it would be a very good thing if tools like Tails included Twofish and elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC) as an alternative to AES and CAST (the default used by GPG), plus steganography tools and other items which are invaluable for social justice and environmental activists and political dissidents.
* Another major source of personally identifying information which is readily available to our adversaries and which can be combined with other data to de-anonymity targets of surveillance comes from smart meters.  These devices are being widely installed in customer residences by \"Western\" power companies.  The transmitted data ranges from total electricity usage sampled at five minute intervals to extremely detailed real-time information listing all the appliances and consumer electronic devices in your home and how much power each is drawing from the grid.  In the first case, anyone sufficiently near your home or office can probably tell whether someone is present, which is in itself a valuable clue; in the second case, much more intrusive snooping about the inventory of consumer electronic items you own and your activities inside your own home is possible.  Typically smart meters transmit unencrypted data at reserved radio frequencies which are public information, so this data is easily available to anyone curious about what electronic devices you own and when you use them.  Since laptops running Linux can now be used as programmable radios, anyone with sufficient skills can easily snag this data, and in many locations it is not illegal to do so, so some data brokers are allegedly starting to do just that.
* I mentioned the widespread use by police, private investigators, and repo men of automatic license plate reader (APR) data to gather personally identifying information, which can be combined with other data to de-anonymize surveillance targets.  (See recent news stories on TrapWire.)  Users of public transit are even easier to track in cities which use transit cards which keep on each card data which typically includes the travelers name and address, plus a months worth of individual travel data (start station, end station, with timestamps).  The data from card readers may be transmitted unencrypted to base stations, making it even easier for third parties to collect this data. Likewise with toll systems which use automatic readers to extract fees from the individual accounts of drivers passing over bridges.  It is no coincidence all of the major providers of transit card systems worldwide are corporate subsidiaries of brand name members of the global military-industrial complex, whose other subsidiaries include companies which sell country-wide surveillance systems.
* All electrical power grids exhibit local \"power line spikes\", brief over and under-voltages which constitute a geolocation \"signature\".  The UK intelligence establishment, which suffers greatly from NSA envy, is quite proud of their claim to be the first to take advantage of this phenomenon for intelligence collection purposes.  Their idea was that the behavior of computers can be affected by power line spikes in ways which can be detected by a remote attacker monitoring an internet data stream.  Less capable governments use a much cruder variant of this idea to target PC users by simply turning off the power neighborhood by neighborhood, and tracking which dissident data streams suddenly vanish.  This information can be combined with other data to identify persons to be rounded up in a \"civil emergency\".  In many nations, blackouts are so common that most residents of the affected neighborhoods won't suspect that anything is amiss.  Recalling that laptops may be somewhat easier to geolocate than PCs, this is one more reason to consider using a PC with a UPC (uninterruptible power supply) while websurfing with Tor.
* Many people probably assume, without really thinking about it, that our adversaries are neither capable of nor interested in tracking in real time the movements and communications of homeless persons.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, \"Western\" governments view their rising urban homeless populations as an alarming risk to public order (imagine the outbreak of bread riots when the urban homeless population rises above ten percent of the total population, as is projected to happen in many countries owing to austerity measures), and they have devised and widely deployed effective means of monitoring the geolocation and communications of homeless individuals.  You can probably guess how this works from what I said about free services.  See also www.epic.org/privacy/poverty for another surveillance program.
* As the global depression deepens, many citizens who were once capable of putting food on the family table are faced with the choice of accepting government food assistance (which entails signing away your expectation of financial privacy) or going hungry.  For this reason, it seems that the monthly bank statements of as many as one in five Americans are picked over by analysts working for Accuity Inc, a subsidiary of Reed-Elsevier, the global publishing giant (headquartered in the UK), under contracts under the guise of benefit fraud detection.  This strikes me as a particularly apt illustration of the often bizarre nature of corporate connections with country-level intelligence collection programs.  Who would have guessed that the publisher of hundreds of scientific journals would also be deeply involved in monitoring the financial transactions of poor people?
* The mythical Chinese agent planning a cyberattack on the public utilities of a major city in an adversary nation can gather invaluable information simply by listening into the unencrypted radio communications of utility crews doing routines maintenance or emergency repairs.  The fact that \"Western\" governments have shown no serious interest in changing how utilities crews communicate is another indication that the hoopla over hypothetical \"Chinese Stuxnet\" is simply a smokescreen intended to frighten legislatures into enacting even more oppressive legislation targeting computer users.  These governments are worried about their own impoverished and disgruntled citizens, not foreigners.
* There are dozens of large companies which offer \"surveillance as a service\", such as Diligence LLC (headquartered in Washington), which frequently hires active duty CIA agents with proven skills in carrying out \"black jobs\" on behalf of corporate clients.  Diligence operatives routinely use their espionage training and specialized spy gear such as IMSI catchers in their field operations.  Diligence allegedly targets the corporate rivals of its own clients, as well as also journalists, government ministers, NSA consultants, and other individuals, as well as corporations such as international data brokers, who often possess information about other targets.
* In another apt example of the absurdly tangled web woven daily by our arachnoid adversaries, Diligence was hired by Alfa Group (a multinational company based in Russia), which was seeking derogatory information on a rival company, IPOC International (based in Bermuda).  Alfa had learned that the government of Bermuda had hired KPMG LLC (based in the Netherlands, with major offices in New York, London, and other financial capitols) to audit IPOC, and in an operation codenamed \"Project Yucca\", Diligence operatives flew to Bermuda and, employing their extensive training in deception, persuaded a KPMG employee to give them documents from the official audit.  Now, KPMG is well known as one of the \"big four\" multinational auditing firms, but it is also one of the largest data brokers dealing in the personal financial and medical information of up to a billion citizens in about one hundred countries.  And the CIA is among the major clients of KPMG (it is no coincidence that KPMG has a major office in McLean, VA).  Allegedly, the agency routinely obtains from KPMG the resumes of applicants for \"interesting\" jobs worldwide.  And CIA field agents are themselves said to be subject to anti-money-laundering surveillance by that very same company.  So in this Project Yucca incident, operatives employed by an American company with extensive CIA ties were hired by a Russian-based multinational (with ties to the Russian government) to spy on a Bermuda corporation by targeting a huge Dutch multinational, a company which in turn apparently spies on CIA field agents.  The incident became public knowledge when a former employee of Diligence passed internal documents describing \"Project Yucca\" to KPMG, which sued Diligence, which settled in 2006. 
* Another company which hires many CIA agents is Wal-Mart, which covets their covert action, information operation (disinformation and disruption), and interrogation skills for actions targeting union organizers, social activists, as well as for routine surveillance of its customers and its own employees, two populations which corporate executives appear to deeply mistrust.  Police agencies around the world also hire CIA agents as advisers on their intelligence operations targeting local \"troublemakers\".  Wal-Mart appears to have enough in-house expertise in \"black bag ops\" that it has no need to hire a company like Diligence.  I don't know whether Wal-Mart operatives have targeted information brokers like KPMG, seeking the personal financial and medical information of activists opposed to their corporate activities, but such a scenario appears all too plausible.  For a similar scenario, search for news stories about the \"Team Themis\" scandal, in which a troika of surveillance companies targeted activists opposed to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which acts as a lobbying organization for the largest American-based multinational corporations.

So far I have stressed the role of publicly traded corporations in country-scale surveillance.  I don't mean to suggest that private companies play no role.  In fact, private companies involved in surveillance are often \"fronts\" for national intelligence agencies.  Very often these connections are not hard to uncover, as several journalists discovered when they found they could easily track the daily movements of the airplanes used in the CIA rendition flights.

I have said almost nothing about global surveillance operations carried out by the NSA itself, in part because I wanted to stress how much of their dirty work has been outsourced to both private companies and publicly traded multinational corporations.  The operation of the now notorious secret room whose existence was revealed by whistle-blower Mark Kline, and many other aspects of global NSA surveillance of ordinary citizens (and US soldiers, and governments closely allied with the USA, and other seemingly unlikely targets), is detailed in the book by James Bamford, The Shadow Factory, which should be read and re-read by anyone interested in the topic of the amazing extent of NSA intrusions into the private life of each and everyone one of us.  Search also for Bamford's recent profile of the Utah Data Center, NSA's newest data slurping facility.

One other topic which seems potentially noteworthy concerns the advent of small drones which can be launched by tossing them into the air, which are designed not as  near-silent surveillance vehicles but as personal assasination munitions.  Activists may well fear these getting into the wrong hands, such as operatives of companies like Diligence.  Who knows how far a CIA mercenary might be willing to go?  Among the countries developing such devices are the USA, Israel, and Iran.
