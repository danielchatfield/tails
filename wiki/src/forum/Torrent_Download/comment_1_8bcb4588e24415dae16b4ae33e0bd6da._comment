No tracker on the public internet should work in I2P. In fact it should only be possible to download torrents created within I2P and only from other I2P peers.

You probably have a quite serious proxy bypass bug in your bittorrent client that makes you connect directly to peers on the public internet without using the configured proxy. In other words you have no anonymity.

Have QBittorrent been reviewed whether it is safe for use with I2P? Or have you just assumed it is? I highly recommend to only use the builtin I2P bittorrent client, because that one is safe.
