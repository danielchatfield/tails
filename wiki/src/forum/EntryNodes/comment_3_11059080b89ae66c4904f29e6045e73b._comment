> maybe there is someone between you and internet (admin of university network, ISP, etc) who can setup which entry node will spy you, I use PCs at university and million times (linux and windows) I get the same starting IP address.

I think the IP adress appearing publically is the *exit* node, or ?

> So, I think someone can setup network and you are always connected to spying nodes

Can the entry node spy the datas? Only the exit node can do this, or ?
