Does anyone *know* if/how Tails would be affected if booted on a system infected with the recently discovered "Rootkit.Linux.Snakso.a" rootkit?


>The malware module was specially designed for the kernel version 2.6.32-5-amd64, which happens to be the latest kernel used in 64-bit Debian Squeezy


More at [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/21/powerful_linux_rootkit/) and [h-online](http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Rootkit-infects-Linux-web-servers-1753969.html)

I've only scanned those articles and haven't had time to analyse any of their content or read the reports and supplementary info they link to myself yet... I thought it'd be worth asking here as we *may* share the targeted kernel.

This **is not** an invitation for sensationalist speculation! ;o)
