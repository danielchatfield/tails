I have a laptop that I'm going to wipe and reconfigure from the ground up, with privacy, security, and Anonyminity being the focus. I'm currently running Ubuntu (10.4) on it. I will wipe the and Trucrypt the whole drive, install some light linux OS, create a Trucrypt hidden OS partion for my main OS... I want something as close to Tails as possible, I have thought of Liberte Linux, I can't seem to find good info on a natively torified and encrypted HDD installable OS. I will be using Tails on SD probibly for the most part, but I would like to have a fallback! I have looked at Backtrack also, I definitely understand the security issues involved with a non-live install. Could I get some suggestions from fellow Torizens, Please?
