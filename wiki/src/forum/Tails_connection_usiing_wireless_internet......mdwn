Hi! I am hoping someone can help with this. I LOVE Tails, so far have used it only on my desktop PC....using bootable USB, booting from start up of computer. My computer is hardwired to cable Internet. Goes right into the main Tails blue screen and automatically starts iceweasel.
I tried to use my laptop similarly, but with a wireless connection. Used bootable USB, took me to the main blue Tails screen and then gave me a box which said something like "wireless connections found click on this icon to choose" However the curser did not appear to go active (from an arrow to a finger point) and when I click on the icon it just disappears, leaving me at the blue Tails screen but with no iceweasel. Then if I click on the iceweasel icon at the top left of the blue screen I get the following message: "The proxy server is refusing connections. Iceweasel is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections". Then it give me two suggestions: check proxy settings to make sure they are correct, or contact you network admin. to make sure proxy server is working.
I do not know how to check proxy settings or what they should be set to. I am sure this has to do with the wireless connection, since, if I hardwire the laptop to the Internet, Iceweasel comes right up.
I would sure appreciate any suggestions and I thank you sincerely!
