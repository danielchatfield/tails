I've been trying to get Tails 0.13 working for a while now, looked through a couple forums in terms of setting date manually and still cannot get a connection. 

After I connect to the internet, it gets stuck at requesting relay information failed and alternates between (connection timeout) and (done). 

Rather new to linux in general. 
Help would be appreciated :)
