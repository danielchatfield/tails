therefore I wanted to try privatix linux but I didn't succeed to install to usb and even when I tried with cat privatix.iso > /dev/... privatix doesn't recognize automatically DHCP details and when i tried to do it manually. I didn't succeed (I tried to copy info from windows ipconfig/all), so, there is no network and internet connection when you install privatix. and support by author doesn't exist, he never send answer.
