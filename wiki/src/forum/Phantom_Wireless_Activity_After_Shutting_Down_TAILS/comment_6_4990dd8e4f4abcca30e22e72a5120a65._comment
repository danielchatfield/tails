@ comment 4:

I appreciate your help and support but I suspect that you misread #3. I don't think \"Tails\" meant it that way.

>the network is probably brought down before Tor gets a chance to cleanly close the connections, and circuit peers try to communicate for some time, with the router still forwarding the packets to non-existing interface.

How long would you expect this to continue before all traffic finally stopped?
