Trying to hide own incompetence behind assumed skepticism, are we? Users are generally not stupid, and know what they see, even if they are not experts in a given subject. In this case, the network is probably brought down before Tor gets a chance to cleanly close the connections, and circuit peers try to communicate for some time, with the router still forwarding the packets to non-existing interface. Next time, try to think a bit before replying.
