Indeed! this wiki and the git back-end do not scale. The community cannot grow much more with this forum as without categories and other functions several interests coincide in the same place. Thus it gets \"crowded\" and leads to disagreements and general stressfulness of the forum. Yet...are you the one who will implement it? If you cant (or wont) then we have to wait until someone able does so such as tails devs and the day only has 24 hours...
