>@ Tails, Commentator 17:

>What is needed is the identification or creation of a suitable forum then, and I think it is clear that we all agree that such a development would be a win-win.

hear hear

>I don't understand what is meant by a \"template\" but I guess this might mean some kind of boilerplate suggesting an alternative forum for discussions likely to be of interest to many Tails users but which \"Tails\" might feel are OT in this forum.

I took the \"template\" to be a draft admonishment. Something that could be re-deployed, perhaps with thread specific modifications, every time an admonishment was deemed necessary.

>@ Commentator 17:

>I disagree with your characterization...

I think you might have misinterpreted the strokes - usually taken to represent \"or\" ...or was comment 20 you, indicating that you meant to address this to comment 1? It's difficult to tell as we're all \"Anonymous\"

>but I think we both agree that this forum is not the place to debate our respective viewpoints on the credibility of claims about surveillance targeting Tor users.

I think we'd all agree with that.

>So please, help to find or lobby for the creation of a suitable forum.

[There's a thread for that](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Educating_Tails_users:_whither_general_privacy_discussions__63__/)! (now) ;)

\"help to find\" ...am doing. Actively. Right now.

\"lobby for the creation...\" ...no chance.

>I warn again that the well-funded organizations most likely to offer \"help\" here are our adversaries, so it is essential for all the finances to be public and verifiable, which unfortunately will be an issue for many/most potential contributors. I feel that the best compromise may be to lobby the Tails Project, Tor Project, Privacy International, RSF, EFF, ACLU, and other organizations to consider trying to combine to create an organization which has no purpose other than to run the lacking forum, possibly with servers in a country more like Iceland and less like Malaysia with respect to intrusive government surveillance, with legal cover from an organization such as the EFF.

I think this has drifted a long way off topic now and belongs on [the other thread](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Educating_Tails_users:_whither_general_privacy_discussions__63__/) so I've transplanted it to [the other thread](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Educating_Tails_users:_whither_general_privacy_discussions__63__/) for comment. Hopefully further dialogue will follow me [there](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Educating_Tails_users:_whither_general_privacy_discussions__63__/) :D
