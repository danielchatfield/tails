I think comment 15 is an ***excellent*** (and sincere) suggestion.

There are clearly people here who wish to discuss assorted Tor/privacy/security/paranoia/technology/conspiracy matters. Reading the previous comments it sounds like they've settled here simply because they can't find somewhere ***appropriate***. If this is really the case, then this whole problem could be very easily remedied. If one of those with an interest in these extra-Tails topics would find somewhere ***appropriate*** for these discussions, that information could be incorporated into an improved admonishment. This would be of benefit to ***both*** the Tails community ***and*** the Tor/privacy/security/paranoia/technology/conspiracy theorists.
