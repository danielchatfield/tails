He might not be a moderator of this forum, but the actual moderators of this forum have made it crystal clear many times in the past that they only wish this to have Tails specific discussion in this forum, they don't want this to be treated like a general privacy forum for anyone to post any privacy related content to.

And since this post is not in any way specific or even all that related to Tails I'd say its completely fair to say that it doesn't belong here.

PS: in case it weren't clear, i'm not the author of comment #1 just in case anybody though so.
