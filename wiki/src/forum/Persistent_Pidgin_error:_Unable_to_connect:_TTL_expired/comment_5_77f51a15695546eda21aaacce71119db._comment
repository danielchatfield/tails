> There is no evidence whatsoever that this hidden service is maintained by OFTC. Including this server in an official image that users rely on for privacy and anonymity shows complete lack of judgement on part of the developers.

My understanding is that it's run by the Debian maintainer of the Tor package for whatever that's worth. Tails could activate SSL for additional authentication, but that will of course throw cert errors all the time which will just make users shit their pants.

Any way, ultimately speaking, why trust `irc.oftc.net`? It's just like trusting your email service provider (and implicitly the one used by the ones you communicate with) which you shouldn't, imho. Use OTR if you need privacy in addition of anonymity.

> is there another server with a #Tails channel, onion or otherwise, that I can go to for Tails-specific support? If not, what would be my best alternative?

If the onion doesn't work you can try the normal `irc.oftc.net` on port 6697 + check the \"Use SSL\" check box.
