I don't.

This would be doable, but I would not mind something faster, that would not be a real field test for sure, but could avoid me to upload a full ISO. E.g. something like \"when you boot Tails and choose Japanese in tails-greeter, then a XYZ entry should appear in the input systems menu in the taskbar\". I mean, I'll be happy to upload an ISO once I have done this kind of basic checks, if they are possible at all.
