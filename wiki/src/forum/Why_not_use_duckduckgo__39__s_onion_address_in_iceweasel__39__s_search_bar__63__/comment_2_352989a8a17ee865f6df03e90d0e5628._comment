Access to hidden services are slower, at least twice as slow than access using exit nodes, and there is a good amount of latency in the initial connection. Tails already goes a great length to prevent leaks and keep every users in a broad anonymity set. So the benefits/costs ratio of accessing DDG through its hidden service is not that high.

Feel free to raise the issue on tails-dev mailing-list if you feel it's worth more discussions.
