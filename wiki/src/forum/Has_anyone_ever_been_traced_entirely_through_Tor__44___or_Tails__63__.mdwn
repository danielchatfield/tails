Hi guys,

I am aware people like hackers have been caught when they were dumb enough to trust a lessor form of security like vpn. And how the drug marketplace was busted. But that was more because of real life packages that they were shipping. Neither was a failure of Tor, though they used it, also. 

My question is: 

Is there any known case of someone being traced entirely through Tor or Tails? Without any of the above additional factors, or just them being stupid with their own giving out of information? If not, could it happen soon?
