> It would be a waste of my time if I started posting the survey (in multiple posts, in one thread) only to have you delete the entire thread.

The relatively little information I have it hand (that is, your two big introductions above, and the fact you claim having posted a lot of other off-topic text on this forum already) don't make me very confident that the result of your survey will be on-topic. Rather the contrary.

Additionally, given the size of the introduction and support text I've been given to read, I can only say that I'm sorry, but this forum is not a fine place for such large pieces of text.

So, please find a better venue than this forum to publish this survey of yours.
