that be deleted like so many of my other threads?

Threads are unlikely to be deleted if they keep to the topic, that is what's
specific to Tails (note that I wrote \"Tails\", not \"Tor\") and don't diverge
to general purpose security, foreign policy, conspiracy theories or whatnot.

But more generally, if so many of your threads get deleted, I suggest you
try to be more careful about sticking to this forum's topic, and perhaps
find more appropriate venues for off-topic discussion.
