The next version of AdvOR is going to introduce AES encryption and making TOR (as it is based on TOR) invincible and untraceable even for the global adversaries.

The next version is also going to introduce the feature of using proxy before and after TOR via ADVOR. This is called innovation, dear TAILS developers.
