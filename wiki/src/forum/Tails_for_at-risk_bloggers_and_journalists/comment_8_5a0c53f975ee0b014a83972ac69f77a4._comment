Mark my words, most of the active participants of this forum have started abstaining from TAILS forum and TAILS mainly because of its size and party because of the ego of the developers. There are many projects like TAILS for example Privatix and some more,with automac changers - the technique which hitherto is could not be adopted by TAILS developers!

See the no. of posts and no. of comments/replies thereon. You are losing your base everywhere but you are still oblivious of the reality around you. I for one was the greatest admirer of TAILS but now I have seen many security loopholes in it.

If TAILS can announce updates of TAILS in their official blog, why the hell can't you allow discussion on TOR? The day the TOR have its forum, no one will visit your forum for sure and mark my words forever.
