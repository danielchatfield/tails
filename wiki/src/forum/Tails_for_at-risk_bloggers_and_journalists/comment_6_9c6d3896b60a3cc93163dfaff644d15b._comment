The Admins of this forum have much time to devote on debates over Off-topic and On-topic posts and do not intend to bring about certain changes which require changes in Tails. If the Tails developers are so intelligent, why do not they try to add some additional (and optional)features like using proxy after TAILS/TOR?

I agree with OP because the information that he intends to share is valuable to TAILS users also. The Admins of this gorum may choose not to read those threads which are off topic; let us have debate on those issues and we do not need your participation if you have no time.

Tails is an off-shoot of TOR and without TOR it has no identity of its own. Most of the users have either switched over to Whonix (which is very huge in size) or I2P or AdvOR and out of these AdvOr is the best, innovative and highly secured amongst all (including TOR and TAILS) in addition to high speed that it provides to its users. Why the switch over? Because the developers of those innovative and secure tools are not egoists and accept every kind of advise. I have stopped visiting this forum long ago because now there is no security discussion and it requires a lot of cumbersome procedure to add proxies before tails and it does not have feature of obfscureproxy feature as yet. Tails is updated much later  after months of TOR update release and renders the users highly vulnerable. 

What's wrong if the OP is allowed to post in the forum and occupy one post/thread? Afterall it will help users of TAils to some an extent.
