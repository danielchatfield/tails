No, we're not going to host random content without reading it. There's various kinds of spam to delete every day, no speaking about the hate talk that comes up from times to times.

About obfsproxy: you might want to read the [[the documentation|doc]] before spreading wrong information about Tails. The rest of that paragraph is full of wrong information too, but well...

This forum is not a fine place to insult anyone, let alone volunteer Tails developers, and tell them at length what kind of effort they should make for you. Repeatedly insisting does not help.

I'm tired of such discussions with people who use this kind of tone,
and I declare this April Fool joke (well, \"discussion\") as closed.
