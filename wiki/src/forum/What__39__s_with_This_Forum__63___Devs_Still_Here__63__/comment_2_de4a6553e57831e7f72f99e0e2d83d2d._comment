Tails developers are working mainly on their free time and we are mostly very very busy. Sometimes we also go on holidays; believe it or not. Today I'm reviewing a lot of forum posts but yes, it has been a while.

Regarding disappearing stuff. Sometimes people duplicate posts or answers and we try to delete such duplicates.

Regarding the tooltip bug I answered yesterday. Happy reading.
