How is the TAILS project funded? Is this info available anywhere?

Also, is there any info available at all about the people behind the TAILS the project, and your motivations?

On the web site for The Tor Project, there is some funding disclosures as well as at least *some* info about at least *some* of the people behind it. But I don't see any of this here for TAILS.

Thanks.
