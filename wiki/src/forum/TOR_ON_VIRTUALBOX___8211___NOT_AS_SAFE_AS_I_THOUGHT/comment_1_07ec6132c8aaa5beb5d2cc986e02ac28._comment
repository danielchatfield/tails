None of the points brought up in the article is false but the headline does seem to be a bit dramatic and misleadinfg, the article simply points out that keyloggers installed on hosts can possibly track keys typed in the VM, which is not exactly a huge revelation for anybody that understands how keyloggers work, and it is one of the things Tails itself warns against on their info page about running Tails in a wm.

If you haven't yet I'd recommend that you read through Tails page on virtualization:
<https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/virtualization/index.en.html>

On it they outline many more possible security disadvantages that there are when running Tails in a vm as opposed to running it from a CD/USB device.

So in other words it's true that there are disadvantages to running it in a VM over running it from a CD/USB device, but all of those disadvantages can be bypassed in some way if you are aware what the possible problems are.
