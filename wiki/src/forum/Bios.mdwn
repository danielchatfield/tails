Sorry if this isn't directly related to Tails itself, but I was wondering whether BIOS (I understands it has some memory) records any information about your use of Tails, or indeed the dates that you are using your system. In short, I want to know if it can be ascertained that I am using an operating system other than my standard windows OS by examing the system itself. Apologies if this sounds a silly question.
