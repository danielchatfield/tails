So lets look  at this issue, how secure is
this option, for staying anonym.?

issue.1.
Using Tails on usb stick, running it from laptop, and allways using other peoples open wifi connections, when
communicating on example onion hidden forums, not speaking about names and locations at no time. ?

issue.2.
using same principes, and reading and sending post from
safe-mail.net. ?
