For detailed instructions on how to burn an ISO image under Linux, Windows or Mac OS X you can consult the corresponding Ubuntu documentation: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto just replace the Ubuntu ISO image by the Tails ISO image you downloaded and ignore the part on verifying the data integrity since you've already done that.
