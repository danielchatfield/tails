@ OP:

But you *did* verify the iso image, didn't you?   I try to always ask because that step is truly essential and Tails could do more harm than good if the user forgets or doesn't know how to do it.  See

For burning the iso image to a DVD, make sure you use a DVD not a CD, and make sure you choose \"burn an image\" rather than \"make a data DVD\".
