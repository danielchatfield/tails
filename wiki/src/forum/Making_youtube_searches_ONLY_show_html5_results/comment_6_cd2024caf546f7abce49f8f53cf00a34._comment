With Tails I have to go to Bookmarks > Show all Bookmarks > (bookmark manager opens) > Organize > New Bookmark

At first I tried going to the bookmark which results in \"%s\" appearing in the search box. This time I typed in the address bar \"webm angelina jolie\" and this must be how we are supposed to do it. Without joining the html5 trail at youtube.com/html5 I got these results:

First video says \"The video is currently unavailable.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Sn08FgKUs

Second video plays. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_xha1wJzmc

Third video says \"The video is currently unavailable.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isfxQ0f0MOA

Forth video plays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ4cAjMMvM

Fith video \"The video is currently unavailable.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_xha1wJzmc

Sixth \"The video is currently unavailable.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLmSZF-cuF0

Seventh \"The video is currently unavailable.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQLnzmqKs5c

Eighth video plays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AybC_iR8FU

This time I try after joining the html5 trail at youtube.com/html5. The YouTube logo in the upper left says YouTube SE (that is a country code).

1st plays (it didn't play last time)

2nd says \"The video is currently unavailable.\" (it played last time)

3rd plays unlike last time

4th plays but it is not the same video as in the above list https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqP948g8DPU

5th \"The video is currently unavailable.\"(It played last time) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcQ4cAjMMvM

refresh 5th \"The video is currently unavailable.\"

refresh 5th again \"The video is currently unavailable.\"

6th plays https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLmSZF-cuF0

7th \"The video is currently unavailable.\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XXrYaiL7jY

8th doesn't play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AybC_iR8FU

So less than half play when I was not in the html5 trial and many of these won't play when I am in the html5 trail. Why is it that I can download any video from YouTube in webm format with Flash Video Downloader? YouTube must be hiding the webm format from us.
