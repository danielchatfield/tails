1.) Remember that add-ons not already in Tails are not supported and could possibly de-cloak you.

2.) I have also experienced erratic, inconsistent results with YouTube on Tails and Tor Browser Bundle. Similar to what the above comment reports (#6), I would get the unavailable message for many, if not most of the videos I tried. Sometimes, the video would start playing after that. Other times, I would have to refresh the page and many times the vid wouldn't play even after numerous refreshes.

3.) Hopefully the download manager planned for Tails will make it easy to download videos for later playing in a stand-alone player.
