I found some info about it on their blog:

The JonDoFox research team has uncovered a new attack on web browsers: Affected are the web browsers Firefox, Chrome and Safari. By a hidden call over of a URL with HTTP authentication data, third party sites could track a user over several web sites, even if the user blocks all cookies and other tracking procedures. For doing this, it is sufficient to include a simple CSS file:
<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" \"http://Session:638431048@ipcheck.info/auth.css.php\">

You will find a demonstration of this technique on the web site ip-check.info.

JonDoFox now contains an integrated protection against this attack. Third party sites may now no longer receive HTTP authentication data from the browser.
