I boot up Tails 0.11, i plugged network in. Nothing happened for a while, it needed to synchronize the clock... A popup appeared that Tails 0.11 is not secure anymore.
But i didn't see the onion icon. It took a while until it appeared, and it was then yellow. A little bit after it went green and iceweasel loaded the tor-check.

How did it know it was outdated without being connected to tor?

Does it connect directly to the tails servers?

Why?!
