Installed current release of Refit on Mac OSX 10.7.3 and rebooted twice as required.

Installed Tails-0.11 on thumbdrive using tails' usb installer from dvd boot.  Plugged thrumdrive into Macbook Pro.

Refit menu appears ok with tux logo linux option.  Selected tux logo.

Boot fails with "no bootable device found" message.

Help?
