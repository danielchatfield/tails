There is no point in running `macchanger` on a network you control, i.e. that can be linked to your state-sanctioned identitiy. MAC addresses are only supposed to be used in a link-local mannder (i.e. on your LAN). Even if your ISP handle them differently and record them it doesn't matter as they already can link your MAC address to you (by definition).

Only use `macchanger` on publicly accessible networks that's not linkable to your real identity.

> The syntax for blacklisting a module called \"net\" would be: net.blacklist=yes

This won't work as `net` isn't compiled as a module in the Debian kernel.

Please create a new [[todo item|todo]] with an approapriate name if you want this feature it in Tails.
