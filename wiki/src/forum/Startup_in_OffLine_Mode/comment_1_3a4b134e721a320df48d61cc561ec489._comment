I start my Tails boot with my router turned off which is effectively an offline mode.  After I select more options from the Greeting page and plug in the root password, I click on the Terminal window icon from the main menu bar which allows me to create aliases in both the default amnesia and root accounts, mount my hard drive, run an initialization script (which also executes the macchanger command and other local modifications), before un-mounting the hard drive and then setting the UTC with the date command (note: I have an atomic watch):  

    date -u MMDDhhmm

where (MM - month, DD - day of month, hh - hour, mm - minute).

Then I turn on the router.

Setting the UTC shortens the time for synchronizing the clock after a connection is made via DHCP with my ISP.
