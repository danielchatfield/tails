Thanks but I don't have the option to modify any of the network, only option available is to reboot the PC and boot off of the tails USB device.  The network and network card are not accessible to me.  Unless you are talking about router software within Tails and I don't know the command to disable it upon boot and persistence doesn't remember that I unchecked the wired network the last time I had booted. 

Is there a Tails grub command that can be added to the line when you select tab along with the already existing options?  I tried removing the nox11autologin but that bypassed everything and I loose access to my Encrypted Partition on the USB stick as well.
