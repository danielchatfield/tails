We have all the intentions to do it. One of them is to do it *right*. Yes, it takes time and energy.

Can you believe that I have already reviewed more than 1000 messages to sort out what needs to be migrated to the new software?

> Tails has no incentive to provide a strong forum for its users. It has page after page of space on the website for its views, none of which can be commented on outside the forum

We have an incentive: we want to enable users to help other users. What we don't want is clueless folks compromising other users security with bad advices.

Anyhow, if you don't like our views, feel free to start your own project. Tails is free software, everything is there.
