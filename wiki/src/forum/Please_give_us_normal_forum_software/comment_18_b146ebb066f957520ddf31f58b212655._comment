Seems PERFECTLY REASONABLE to me. Tails has a moral and legal duty to censor (that'll be \"moderate\" if you're a Yank who speaks in euphemisms) this forum.

>>I'm not sure this discussion will lead to anywhere enjoyable or useful. But I'm sure it does make Tails developers spend time here, while they could do something more enjoyable and useful instead. Comment by Tails â€” Sun 11 Nov 2012 01:37:00 PM CET

>Tails believes that this forum distracts it from other \"useful\" activities, and routines replies to anything critical with a \"why dont you contribute\" retoric...

No, \"Tails\" posts sometimes try to point out that once specific threads have ceased to serve a useful function, the ratio of burden:benefit on the developers of monitoring subsequent posts will lie too heavily on the \"burden\" side with very little (no?) \"benefit\". Try reading that post again. Perhaps you'll understand.

If you have another look around this forum, with your whining moron setting disabled, you'll find many, many *helpful* posts singed \"Tails\" and even a smattering of *thank you* notes addressed to \"Anonymous\" and singed \"Tails\"!!!111111

In fact, while you've got your whining moron setting disabled, if you stop to think about it you might find that even the comment above, which you've taken such exception to, is actually helpful and constructive! We are *all* here primarily for Tails (the distro) rather than Tails (the user forum), after all, aren't we? So that'd make *anything* which can be done to focus development resources on Tails (the distro) and away from less constructive distractions like Tails (the fuckwits bickering amongst themselves and whining on and on, on the forum) a very good thing. Wouldn't we all agree?

There's an *h* in rhetoric by the way.
