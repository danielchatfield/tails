I posted comment **7**, in which I merely expressed my *hope* that posts expressing strong dissent will not be excluded from, \"what needs to be migrated to the new software?\" (TAILS).

I did **not** post comment **4** (the second one), which made the *accusation* that,

>TAILS has been editing critical comment right from the beginning leaving most forum users unaware that they have been censored

This is yet another case where different posters are assumed to be the same simply because they both dissent from the prevailing chorus of \"yes men\". 

There should be a rule against speculation that tries to link different **anonymous** posters.
