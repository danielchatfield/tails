Just because someone has a different view to you doesn't make them a troll and deleting a post just because they call you a cock head goes against the ethos and idea of freedom of speech which this project is based around and why it's supported as a project by tor on it's homepage.

That would be like Communism run by the law and opinions of a Dictator.
