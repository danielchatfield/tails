*dissent*:
>Difference of opinion or feeling; disagreement.

 The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. Answers.com 29 Oct. 2012. http://www.answers.com/topic/dissent

(First definition for the noun form of 'dissent')

\"Dissent\" is Perfectly appropriate here. Your argument is specious.

>The word \"dissent\" is really gay in this context.

For your sake, I *hope* you are just trolling...

Otherwise, the irony is just too much.

(The word \"gay\" is really...immature...lowbrow...vulgar...unsavory...in this context.)
