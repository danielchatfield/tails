>It's on the todo list. If you'd like to hurry it along, then perhaps contributing would be more helpful than nagging on the forum

This topic has been raised over and over and over again. It is clear to all by now that Tails has no intention of introducing a new forum. It was promised more than a year ago and surprise surprise never materialised

The reasons that TAILS has no intention of replacing the forum is that it was chosen to be this way all along. If you read through the forum you can see a pattern where any subject critical of TAILS is spammed at the beginning. The forum design was chosen to be backwards with the newest comments at the bottom, making spamming more effective. 

Tails claims that the ability to change the subject is also to be rectified.  Strangely no action only the same comment over and over again 

>perhaps contributing would be more helpful

TAILS has been editing critical comment right from the beginning leaving most forum users unaware that they have been censored

Tails has no incentive to provide a strong forum for its users. It has page after page of space on the website for its views, none of which can be commented on outside the forum
