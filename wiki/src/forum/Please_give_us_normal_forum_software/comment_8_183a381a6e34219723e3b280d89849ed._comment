The term dissent suggests something admirable such as political or
religious dissent against the ideas of an authority who would use
their position of power to impose their will upon you in a situation
where you risk life, liberty or reputation by resisting. Tails is not
a world-wide system of oppression, it is a small distro which you are
at liberty to stop using if you find its practices don't suit your
needs. The word \"dissent\" is really gay in this context.
