Everyone take a close look at comment 16 by TAILS. This is the exact attitude which has been expressed by TAILS on a number of occasions.

The truth is that this subject is too critical of TAILS, which is the only reason it has drawn condemnation signed by TAILS. This discussion is right on the money, and outlines a flaw in TAILS openness and transparency which are the very ideas this software is suppose to be designed to promote
