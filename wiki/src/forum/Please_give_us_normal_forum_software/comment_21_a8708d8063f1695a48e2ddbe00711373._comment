@20:

Of course I realize that ultimately there would be no practical way of enforcing any such rule. Nonetheless, I do believe that an official statement from the Tails devs (and community) making it clear that the type of behavior in question is not welcome and that any posts exhibiting it are subject to deletion on sight would serve as a *deterrent*.

(Because it does not appear to me that all of the people making such posts are complete trolls.)
