Every time I am getting the following messages in my message log.
I did not had them when using the regular Tor bundle.

This one keeps coming back, but I can still browse without a problem.

Destination '[scrubbed]' seems to be an invalid hostname. Failing.


This one was new for me:

[Notice] Your system clock just jumped 3589 seconds backward; assuming established circuits no longer work.


Can anyone tell me what the mean, and is my security or anonymity at a risk here?

I searched for an answer but could not find something that i understood.


Thanks a lot
