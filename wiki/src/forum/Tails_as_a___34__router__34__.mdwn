Is it possible to use Tails as a Tor router? let's say you have an old PC with two NICs (one connected to the ISP router and the other would be to connect a second PC, which all traffic should be redirected to the Tor network) I know that it's not the Tails purpose but it couldn't be too hard to adapt it using iptables (well it's hard to me but it won't be to a more versed person in iptables) My attempts to do it were very basic, just using "iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE" (where eth0 is the NIC connected to internet) in the Tails side hoping it to work in the same way you share your connection using iptables but with the difference that all the traffic will be redirected to Tor, of course it was not that simple, I didn't get connectivity at all, so the cause may reside in one of the default Tails rules hence I've tried to flush all rules (just for testing purposes because I would like to adapt it in the way that the new rules could coexist with the default ones without compromising the anonymity) and reapplying mine (of course in this scenario the traffic won't be redirected to Tor since I cleaned all the rules up, but the purpose of this was just to test connectivity) but unfortunately it didn't work either, probably because the default policy for the chains is DROP, so I changed it in the chains INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD, which didn't work either, however I don't remember if I did the same for POSTROUTING and PREROUTING, I need to do more tests but first I wanted to ask here. A far I can tell the problem is that the client PC can't "see" the Tails PC ( I can't ping the tails machine from the client but I can ping the client from tails)

A this point I have two important questions: 1) why the client PC can't "see" the Tails machine even when I flushed all iptables rules? and 2) what iptables rules should I use in order to masquerade traffic to the Tor network in a way they can coexist with the existent Tails configuration? Any help would be very appreciated but please avoid answers like "why do you need to use Tails as a router when you can use it as is" because I know that but I'm experimenting with a Tor router approach (using a PC because it's better to maintain compared to different solutions, for instance, using OpenWRT + Tor in an old router or something like that) and, since there is not a live cd project that aims to this purpose (as far I know), I see Tails as the perfect candidate to adapt.
