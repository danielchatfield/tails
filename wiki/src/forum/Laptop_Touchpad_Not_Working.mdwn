Booted Tails 0.15 from DVD on a HP laptop. It booted to the desktop and a copy of Iceweasel is opened. I can move the cursor with the laptop touchpad. But it seem that touchpad tap function is not working when I move the cursor over the 'Application' or any of the pulldown menu.
1. How do I get the touchpad to be working?
2. How to I control the desktop pulldwon menu with the keyboard?
