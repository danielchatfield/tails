I would say from what I read the short answer would be less unless more precautions are taken. I am not real knowledgeable about security, I am just learning. I have always had an interest in security and encryption. I guess I am starting a learning adventure with Tails. I must admit, I don't have a pressing need for this type of security or anonymity but have always wanted to learn. I will read more documentation on this site and if you want to point me to other sites where I can learn more please do. I think these types of security issues may be necessary later. I know in some countries it is a must.
