how in the hell could installing it on a virtual machine be more secure?

think this through...

youre going from a scenario(booting off dvd) where every time you power down the machine everything dissapears; to a scenario where everything you do is stored in a file on your computer! everything you do on that virtual machine has a chance to be cached to the host operating systems swap file!

this is the equivalent to asking \"is it more secure to have someone dictate on carbon paper my inflamatory memo that could get me in trouble?\"
