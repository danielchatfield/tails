Thought I'd died and gone to heaven when I found this link buried in the torproject.org documentation pages.  Lots of fascinating papers about various kinds of attacks on Tor network:

* correlators using packet timing attacks
* correlators using Baysesian classifiers
* browser fingerprinting attacks
* website fingerprinting attacks
* social profiling attacks
* routing attacks
* authentication attacks
* various statistical attacks
* network disruption attacks
* perfect matching attacks
* attacks leveraging network topology

Only a few of these are so far mentioned in the Tails or Tor documentation pages, possibly because some of them have not yet been observed \"in the wild\".  Expect future work on MITM attacks (designed to break the encryption of Tor circuits) and certificate attacks (designed to insert malware into iso during download), which have been observed \"in the wild\" (or rather, largely unsuccessful attempts have been observed; what worry me are the successes of our adversaries).

In practice, the greatest dangers may come from attacks not on Tor itself but on non-Tor vulnerabilties in the browser exploited by various state and corporate-sponsored ROCs (remote operation centers).  That is obviously an even bigger topic than the large literature describing attacks on Tor.
