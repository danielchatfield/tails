This may not be what you are looking for but I thought I'd just mention, for the possible benefit of others:

Lubuntu (Ubuntu with LXDE instead of Gnome and lighter default applications) is quite lightweight and can be installed with full-disk encryption by choosing the *alternate install* ISO.

I installed Lubuntu 11.10 on a system with 512 MB of RAM and found it quite usable for basic tasks such as browsing, text-editing (LeafPad, IIRC), word-processing (AbiWord)-- even with Firefox instead of the included Chromium.
