Beware that Tails seems to do A LOT to improve just the *basic usability* of Debian Live!

When I tried regular Debian Live it didn't even recognize my *USB ports*! (Same USB ports that work fine in Tails and every other OS I've tried.) 

Never mind any of my wireless adapters, though that I'd expect.
