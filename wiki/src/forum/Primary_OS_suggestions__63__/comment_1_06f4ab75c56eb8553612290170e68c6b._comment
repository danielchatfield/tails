Install GNU/Linux Debian and get inspiration from the relevant parts of the [[Tails configuration files|http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=tree;f=config/chroot_local-includes;hb=refs/heads/devel]] (in particular the files in /etc, like firewall*.conf). Note that this obviously isn't something we support.
