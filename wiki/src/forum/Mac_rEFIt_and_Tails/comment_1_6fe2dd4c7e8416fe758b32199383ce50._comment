Setting the boot flag on a USB partition is easy:

1. Using Disk Utility, format the USB with an MBR
2. Create a volume partition with FAT format
3. Check the bootable flag for the partition

Then burn the Tails ISO file (e.g. on your Desktop) to the USB using Tails USB Creator tool (and the third variant with ISO file).

Than retry your booting rEFIt from a CD on a Mac and selecting a USB device that has Tails installed on it.
