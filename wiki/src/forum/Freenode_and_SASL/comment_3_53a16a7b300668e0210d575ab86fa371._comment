I think that an easy solution for this problem is needed. Meaning, it would make sense to update pidgin to the newest version (2.10.7 ; it is the first version with SASL supported by default).

The motivation is that some people use Tails to do bussiness in bitcoins. In the bitcoin universe, there is a certain world-of-trust system, called bitcoin-otr.com . The ratings there are updated via a channel on Freenode, and thus simple access to it is of crucial importance.

Thanks!
