Thanks comment 3, that was actually useful. It seems to me somewhat unlikely that a popular addon like downloadhelper contains this behavior. But I see that it is unfortunately possible. And therefore should be avoided for people serious about security. 

If only operating systems and browsers weren't so quick to give control of your computer and information to outside entities. But I guess that's why we have Tails. :)

I can't wait for minitube. That should actually be secure since I guess it's going to be integrated by the Tails team.
