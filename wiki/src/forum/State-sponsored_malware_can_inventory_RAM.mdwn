An important development confirms a key point which some of us have been trying to make concerning the Tails thread model: US TLAs use state-sponsored malware with the capability to *remotely* search, inventory, and report to the attacker the contents of *RAM* on a running "target computer".

Cryptome has just published a public document, an order by a US judge concerning a request by the FBI to use malware to infect one or more "target computers" in a investigation of suspected money-laundering.

The malware cited in the order is un-named but may be the malware which the FBI calls CIPAV.


The document includes this description of the state-sponsored malware:


> The FBI has commenced an investigation, leading to this search warrant request. At this point in the investigation, the location of the suspects and their computer is unknown. The Government does not seek a garden-variety search warrant. Its application requests authorization to surreptitiously install data extraction software on the Target Computer.

> Once installed, the software has the capacity to search the computer’s hard drive, *random access memory*, and other storage media; to activate the computer’s built-in camera; to generate latitude and longitude coordinates for the computer’s location; and to transmit the extracted data to FBI agents within this district. Using this software, the government seeks to obtain the following information:

> (1) records existing on the Target Computer at the time the software is installed, including:

* records of Internet Protocol addresses used;
* records of Internet activity, including firewall logs, caches, browser history and cookies, “bookmarked” or “favorite” Web pages, search terms that the user entered into any Internet search engine, and records of user-typed Web addresses;
* records evidencing the use of the Internet Protocol addresses to communicate with the [victim’s bank’s] e-mail servers;
* evidence of who used, owned, or controlled the TARGET COMPUTER at the time the things described in this warrant were created, edited, or deleted, such as logs registry entries, configuration file, saved user names and passwords, documents, browsing history, user profiles, e-mail contents, e-mail contacts, “chat,” messaging logs, photographs, and correspondence;
* evidence of software that would allow others to control the TARGET COMPUTER;
* evidence of times the TARGET COMPUTER was used; and
* records of applications run.

> (2) prospective data obtained during a 30-day monitoring period, including:

* accounting entries reflecting the identification of new fraud victims;
* photographs (with no audio) taken using the TARGET COMPUTER’s built-in camera after the installation of the NEW SOFTWARE, sufficient to identify the location of the TARGET COMPUTER and identify persons using the TARGET COMPUTER;
* information about the TARGET COMPUTER’s physical location, including latitude and longitude calculations the NEW SOFTWARE causes the TARGET COMPUTER to make;
* records of applications run.

Note that the mentioned capabilities also suggest what kinds of metadata are currently targeted by US state-sponsored malware available to the FBI.  It seems to be quite possible that US, Chinese  and Israeli cyberspies all have even more sophisticated abilities.

Note that if you use Tails booted from a R/O DVD and are disconnected from any networks during booting and configuring Tails, it is possible that even if the OS on your computer's hard drive has been infected with state-sponsored malware with the capability to search, inventory and report the contents of RAM, it is possible that the malware might be thwarted.  But if it has infected BIOS this may not be true.

Note also the reference to geolocation of the targeted computer.

Note that the FBI appears to use a very broad definition of "money-laundering" under which anyone suspected of mining bitcoins may be considered to be engaged "suspected money-laundering" and thus to be a suitable target for this kind of malware.  I hardly need add that some of us consider this an outrageous, dangerous, and illegal assumption.  Interestingly enough, it seems that the judge also felt the FBI was overreaching in this case because the request was apparently *denied*.

I guess that the cited malware may infect Windows OS, so Tails users would be immune to such intrusions from this particular malware, but it is known that the US TLAs are switching to using Linux (see the recent talk by Gus Hunt of the CIA), so it would be a serious mistake to assume they have no malware with capable of attacking Linux.  Indeed, I consider it likely that they are specifically attacking Tails.
