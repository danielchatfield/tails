I realize that there are several individuals who have contributed substantial amounts of code to the Tails project, some of whom prefer to remain anonymous (so do I).  (And thanks, by the way.)

But in an unrelated thread here, someone claimed:

> You seem to think that "Tails" (the eponymous source of many forum posts) is an individual. It's the signature to posts from the developers' shared account.

Is that true?  Because if so, isn't sharing a common user account a classic failure mode from the viewpoint of network security?
