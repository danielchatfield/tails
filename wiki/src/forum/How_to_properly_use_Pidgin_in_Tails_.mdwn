Until recently I was using torchat due to its simplicity. But your opinion about it is not very encouraging. So I decided to give this pidgin bird a try (I try it some time ago but only in Windows and as a "host" for the account from "ordinary" massenger like yahoo...)

I've read documentation about OTR stuff, but still I just fail to understand how to use it in the "private way" in Tails properly. 

Let's say I start Tails and Pidgin, my husband on his buisness trip does the same - what should we do to connect to each other? 
There are 3 accounts already configurated - should we use one of those to chat safetly? Or should we create new ones (some yahoo, g talk stuff like that)? It's pretty confusing to me...
