Quick note to say I am finding Google Docs not editable since they gave the site a new look.  I don't know if anyone else is finding this, but it is not the first website that has demonstrated to me that Tails could do with a browser upgrade if at all possible.

Keep up the good work :)  Tails seems to be getting stronger and stronger each release.
