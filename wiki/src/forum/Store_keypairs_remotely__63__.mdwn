I'm new to PGP, so I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

Basically it seems that the only way to consistently use the same key is to create one within Tails and enable the persistent file.

However this means that anyone can access your keys as the persistent file is not encrypted.

What I would like to do ideally is export my keypairs, and then store them in a text based password vault like KeepassX, or in a plaintext file within a truecrypt vault.

Is it possible to do this and then re-import them for later use as needed?
