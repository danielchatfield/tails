Thank you for helping me.

I am located in the Netherlands. I just type \"yahoo.com\" into the address bar, and then click the link to sign up.

A few minutes ago I tried it again. I got a Danish homepage (http://dk.yahoo.com/?p=us). The second tab within the page contained a Dutch (Netherlandic) flag. When I wend to the register page (still in Danish) the dropdown was an \"Frankrig\" (France).

When I restarted the browser I came to a German homepage, with an US flag on the second tab.

Could it be coincidence I got the dutch flag, and before the Netherlands in the dropdown? I just do not trust it anymore.
