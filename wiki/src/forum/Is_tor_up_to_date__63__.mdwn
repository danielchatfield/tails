First, I'd just like to say that tails seems like it almost too good to be true. Although, its not perfect and clearly has its issues.

In the message logs of Vidalia it states that my Tor software is out of date. For awhile it wouldn't connect to any relays because of this until I restarted tails. I thought 0.2.2.34 was the latest verison of Tor and 0.9 latest verison of tails? Please clear this up. Thanks.
