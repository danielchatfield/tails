Nix \"lsof -i\" unless you can prevent it from trying to do DNS lookups every few seconds.

Reading the manpages for tools like iftop shows how to suppress (wasteful and possibly dangerous over the long term) DNS lookups.

\"Tails\" said that recent problems with sudo (fixed in a patch incorporated into Tails 0.17.1) were probably not serious for Tails users.  If so

     sudo iftop -Pn

might work well to keep an eye on Vidalia.
