Unless a future edition of Tails includes iftop, you'll need to live install it.

* set up a root password when you boot Tails from live DVD
* when Tor is working, call the Synaptic package manager (see the Tails menu)
* use the search window to search for the iftop package
* install it
* expect to see the dialog say it is falling back on readline

Some of us would like to see some small and useful utilities like iftop, seccure, steghide included in future editions of Tails.

Needed: a steganography tool which can be used to hide mesages in uploaded Youtube videos.  These are perfect since 

* not previously published, so no comparision file available
* very long, so easier to quietly hide files
* ubiquitous format/website, uploading in itself should not draw attention
