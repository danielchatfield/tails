I hope that this happens eventually. I just got Fedora up and running from an SD card and I'm rather pleased with it! I'm mainly concerned about being able to use Tor for online banking so my need is fulfilled, but I've grown used to Tails and Fedora doesn't quite feel as comfortable.

Well, I'll be keeping an eye out. I suspect (read: hope and pray) that as soon as Google/Samsung gets more stock and the price falls back down to $249, we'll be seeing much more development from all the major distros.
