The less you try to customize Tails the \"safer\" it is for you as long as staying in Tails anonymity set is concerned.

I personally don't know how \"safe\" it is to disable monkeysphere and I don't care as long as I don't deel the need to disable it, and am not willing do the required audit work to know how safe it is.

If you do, please go ahead and report your findings. And if you want to participate in the decision on what it included or not by default in Tails, please join tails-dev@boum.org.
