Hello everybody,

I can't see folders and files anymore on my encrypted usb drive. Yesterday I compressed two folders into .zip and .7z and when I now open the usb drive, all the folder are gone including the uncompressed folders. When I search for a file, then I can find some files, but I can't see any folder or file on the drive. I have checked 'Show hidden files', but I still can't see the folders. When I compressed the folders I think I accidentally checked also 'encrypt the file list too'.

How can I display all the (hidden) files that are on the drive? Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance.
