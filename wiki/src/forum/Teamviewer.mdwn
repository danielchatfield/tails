I run Tails from USB and have teamviewer installed (wine).

When i connect to a "friend" computer with teamviewer what IP TM server is getting? What is known about my internet connection?

As far as i understand.

For TM server the hole thing looks like: my TM client <-> 127.0.0.1 <-> .... <-> Exit node IP <-> TM Server <-> My "friend".

So TM Server only knows exit node IP and nothing more. Am i right?

P.S. Is it the same for any other application (hamachi for exmpl, or any kind of rdesktop connection)?

P.P.S. What about encryption? Teamviewer creates VPN connection, so the exit node can not get any info, right?

P.P.P.S We must use a new copy of TM every time using it, cause it creates personal id for every client. If we use it more then 1 time we can be tracked. Your opinion?
