I want to use a USB with two partitions one 700MB (sdb1) with Tails for booting and then another partition using the rest of the drive (sdb2) that will be encrypted.

I basically want what unetbootin does but with the original tails iso untouched (no  unetbootin bugs or branding)

how is this exactly done? I've tried some guides but I'm getting confused with the documentation on offer.

Thank you. 

Gavin.
