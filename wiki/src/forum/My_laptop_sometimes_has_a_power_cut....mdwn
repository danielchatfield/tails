I'm just wondering if, because Tails doesn't always shut down the way it's supposed to, if this can or will cause problems? 

I'm running it from a LiveCD, if that matters.

Also, for the time being, I'm actually using Tails as my default/only OS, for day-to-day browsing using the Unsafe Web Browser. My Windows OS got deleted (I think I deleted the partition by mistake), so this is the only OS I have. Is this safe? I'm not using it for anything that needs encrypted or hidden, just general web browsing (hence the Unsafe Browser), but I'm not really computer literate, so if anyone could let me know if this is dangerous or harmful, it'd be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

(I'm working on getting a new Windows disk)
