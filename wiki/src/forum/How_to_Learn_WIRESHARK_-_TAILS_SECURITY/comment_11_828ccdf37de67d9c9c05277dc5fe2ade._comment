Wireshark is open source and available for free as a Debian package, and it comes with plenty of useful documentation, including an expression builder which helps you to build filters which help you to see only the packets which might suggest a problem.  Wireshark is very powerful and for just one computer it should do well in capturing all the packets.

Ideally you would use your \"trusted\" PC (maybe running off a security minded live CD) to sniff traffic on your LAN to and from your \"untrusted\" PC (running and possibly compromised by the suspect FF plugin).  But unless you have suitable hardware (two ethernet cards suitably configured) you wont' be able to sniff packets in \"promiscuous\" mode.  I think.

Mike Perry has a good document somewhere at the TorProject.org website explaining the design goals of TorButton, in which he makes a good point: the more plugins you install, even \"security-promoting\" ones, the more likely you will compromise your anonymity and possibly your security too!

As a silly example, using a spell checker can help prevent idiosyncratic spelling mistakes which might tend to enable an sophisticated adversary like the US government from identifying you uniquely by quirks of your usage of natural language (see stylometry, de-anonymization, or \"authorship identification\").  But using an on-line spell checker would defeat the purpose.

Another silly example: asking FF to warn you about problem websites sounds like a good idea from the perspective of security, but checking this option in FF preferences will I think cause FF to make third-party callouts which could possibly degrade your anonymity while using Tor, which may be why that box in unchecked by default in Tor Browser Bundle.

In general, unfortunately electronic-security and electronic-anonymity can be somewhat conflicting goals, and in general, everyone must seek a compromise.  It might seem to be good to educate users to make wise decisions about what choices are best for their individual needs--- but even that is dangerous because anything which makes you stand out tends to degrade your anonymity.

So obtaining both anonymity and security is a really hard problem.  Nevertheless this is the problem we all can, should, and must wrestle with daily.
