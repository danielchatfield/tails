Tails is obviously rigth of course. When I talked about unplug and wireshark (Note that I EMAILED with the developer who USED Wireshark..I don't know how to use wireshark myself but I heard it is quite dificult:( ).. he used it to make sure his addon didn't leak the ip adress...and it DID, and now he is altering it to make it Tor and proxy compliant..Tails would not allow unplug to leak the IP anyway but Tor Browser Bundle would.

But browser finguerprinting is another issue altogether... as far as I understand it (which is not completelly).. you would then stand out as the person who uses unplug amognst tails users...they would be able to say who you were or to see where you are but.. adversaries could correlate your activities like...the tails user with this addon visited this site, and then this one, and that one on the other day..and so on...

If the plugin is included in all Tails iceweasel then the problem goes away, but I think tails is thinking about making iceweasel finguerprint equal to the Tor Browser Bundle... and really that is taking things to a very high level Developer-wise. who knows though.. if it turns out it adds function without compromising anonimity it migth be \"adopted\" even in tbb.. but don't expect that for any plugin in beta that has not been audited by the developers or something.

You can do it for yourself, but bear in mind that your anonimity will be sligthly decreased..depending on your adversary it migth be worth it, but if Tails users start fragmenting into diferent browser plugins it will make it worse for ALL of us.. so overall not a good idea at all.
