Also, see the link Tails posted 

https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/warnings/index.en.html#browser_plugins

topic Overwriting Configurations:

\"The persistent volume allows you to overwrite the configuration of the programs included in Tails. Those programs are carefully configured with security in mind. Overwriting the default configuration can break this security or render them unusable.

Furthermore, the anonymity of Tor and Tails relies on making it harder to distinguish one Tails user from another. Changing the default configurations can break your anonymity.\"

So, without certainty I would say no. It is Not Safe..

I know many times it is tempting to (in metaphor now) 

leave the nest anonym and intrigeri and so many other developers have carefully built for us.. I am tempted to do it many times by whishing Tails had this feature or that feature..

But you see..while a little bird may be happy when it flies alone, he must be very VERY carefull...Out there be monsters...and cats :P.. they will de-anonimize you and eat you...

Browser Plugins...such an innocous thing..but then an adversary could correlate your activities and if it becomes interested in you.. wait until you make a mistake (like saying your name in a public forum....really, was it worth it? what purpose did it fulfill other than gratuitously and greatly reducing your anonimity?)... and then when has a suspicion of who you are (if powerfull and suficiently determined.. make an end-to-end correlation attack against you.. (and mind you it does not have to be a government.. just regular law enforcement or a nasty hacker, who manages to whatch a big part of the web...

Think law enforcement which requests assistence from your ISP and the ISP the page you are visiting... or a hacker who works for a top-tier ISP.. 

what happened to the little bird then? Cats got it! It was eaten up by the dark monsters of the web lol..

So little bird, stay in the nest for a while longer.. by all means train your wings so that you may be fast and the wind your friend and not your enemy.. but think you are not ready to fly alone (end of metaphor)

Hope you find the methaphor enjoyable :) I am a newbie myself so by no means is this meant to be insultuous or anything. Also I may have been inacurate so if I was mistaken in my assesment of some dangers I am glad to stand corrected.
