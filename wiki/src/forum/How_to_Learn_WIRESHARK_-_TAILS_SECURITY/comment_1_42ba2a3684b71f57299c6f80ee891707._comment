Sorry but I won't write here a two-minutes wireshark tutorial that will 
solve your problem.

When we are saying that installing [[additional browser plugins might
compromise your anonymity|/doc/first_steps/persistence/warnings#browser_plugins]] we are talking about different threads that
might not all be easy to detect, even using wireshark.

For example, torbutton does a lot of work to anonymize your browser 
fingerprint. An additional plugin might alter those protections and 
still that would not show up in wireshark as a connection not going 
through Tor.

That was just to share with you the first example that came to my mind.
There are probably a lot of other potential threads.
