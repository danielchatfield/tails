>if Tails users start fragmenting into diferent browser plugins it will make it worse for ALL of us.. so overall not a good idea at all.

Would there be a problem if you uninstall the addons when you are not using them and get a new identity from Torbutton?

Torbrowser is portable so you can copy the torbrowser folder and use one stock version for better anonymity and another for nonstandard addons. It is also possible to run these two Torbrowser sessions at once (on Ubuntu). I'm not sure if this threatens privacy but they seem to work together.
