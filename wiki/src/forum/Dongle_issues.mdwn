Hi,

I connect to the internet using a mobile broadband dongle, and I have had to click on the New Mobile Broadband (GSM) Connection and then select my country and Broadband provider before I am connected. However, I have recently got a new dongle (using the same data sim card), and when I startup now the internet automatically connects when I log on, and says I am connected with a Wired network connection “auto eth1”. Surely this can't be right? Can anyone please explain what is happening, and whether this is significant?

Thank you.
