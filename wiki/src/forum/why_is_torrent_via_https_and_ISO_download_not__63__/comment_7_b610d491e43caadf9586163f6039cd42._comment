Hi,

> Interesting...in the past, wget got stuck on trying to verify the SSL cert. Now, it looks like wget just redirects to HTTP ?

No, it's exactly the contrary: when you wget from https://archive.torproject.org/blah/blah/foobar, it uses https (port 443); if you try to wget from http://archive.torproject.org/whatever/you/want, it redirects from http (port 80) to https (port 443).

Please, learn to read, or at least make some usable comparisons: if one day wget outputs something like
\"HTTPS request\", you should ask you questions about your wget version... and be afraid instead of satisfied... there is no HTTPS request; only HTTP (or FTP, SMTP, etc.) requests, optionally using a secure protocol, or not.

cheers
