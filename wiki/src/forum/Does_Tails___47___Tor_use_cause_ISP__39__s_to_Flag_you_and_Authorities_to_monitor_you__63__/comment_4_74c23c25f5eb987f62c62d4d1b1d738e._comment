@ OP:
> I heard that using Tails / Tor will get you automatically flagged by your ISP and then investigated / monitored by police / authorities on grounds of suspicious behavior! Is this true?

In some countries, possibly, but definitely not in the UK since you have [about 10 000 Tor users every day](https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users&start=2011-11-29&end=2012-02-27&country=gb&dpi=72#direct-users). The fact that you are using Tor may of course be noted and added to the file your local security police keeps on you, though. Who knows?

@ comment 2:
> You could use bridges or proxies to access the tor network so the ISP can not see that you are using tor. 

Tails has [[experimental support for a \"bridge only mode\"|doc/first_steps/bridge_mode]].

@ comment 3:
> What about using a VPN then Tor? Can an ISP see that Tor is being used if I connect to a VPN first??

Only if the VPN provider collaborates with the ISP. Unfortunately Tails doesn't support using VPNs like this yet (see: [[todo/vpn_support]]).
