I find the following perfectly adequate for my degree of paranoia:

1. Terminate Iceweasel

2. Vidalia -> \"New Identity\"

3. Run Iceweasel

This quick and simple sequence will wipe Iceweasel's session data, while ensuring your new tor circuit can not be tainted.

As for what specific threat re-booting is supposed to prevent, which isn't mitigated by the above, one can only guess... Any potentially exploitable user-agent fingerprints, user habit heuristics, etc., will still be present *after* a cold reboot. So it can't be any of that. If Tor's \"new identity\" facility is not trustworthy, then the whole Tor system is intrinsically untrustworthy and rebooting would do nothing to correct that! There's, perhaps, a remote possibility that Iceweasel could retain data between private sessions but that seems to have been rather thoroughly examined by a great number of people (even myself) and seems at least as reliable as any other part of the privacy house-of-cards. Any malicious code in Tails its self would have full system access and so could cache data persistently anyway. That pretty much leaves drive-by exploits. I suppose an arbitary-code-execution-without-root-escalation style Iceweasel exploit could persist after terminating the browser and re-pwn the new session. Perhaps that's is what the reboot-for-a-new-identity advice is intended to prevent?
