@ OP:

I think that's innocuous.  It is just Debian's way on ensuring that apt (the excellent Debian package management tool) will work with a variety of protocols which users may encounter. (Debian is the Linux distribution on which Tails is based.)   I believe that you won't use any of the more unusual protocols if you are downloading something like the new TBB tarball from a server which uses http to offer such files.
