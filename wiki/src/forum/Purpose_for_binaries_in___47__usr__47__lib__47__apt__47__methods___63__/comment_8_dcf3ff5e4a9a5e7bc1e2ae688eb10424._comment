One would hope that. Building a security critical operating system upon a by todays standards rather insecure OS seems not like an intelligent choice.

But I doubt this will change in Tails current state. First at least one of the core developers of Tails is also a Debian developer. He/she knows Debians inner workings and have a good relationship with other Debian developers (I presume). Switching to building Tails upon another distribution is a very large task, especially if you have no relationship with upstream or knowledge about the tools and methods used to build on top of that distribution.

But a new major Debian stable release (7.x) is on the way, and Tails current plans are to switch to it. That will (at least temporarily) improve things a bit regarding security.

In the future I hope Tails is built upon another linux distribution that takes security more seriously, or even better, that Debian starts taking security more seriously.
