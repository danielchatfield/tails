Is the software in Debian Stable compiled with stack smash protection and hardening? No. Is the software in Ubuntu/Fedora? Yes, and have been for a few years.

Is any application confinement as AppArmor or SeLinux used to confine applications that is popular targets for attacks in Debian Stable? No. Is it in Fedora? Yes. Ubuntu? Partly.

Do Debian Stable have any protection at all against zero-day exploits? Maybe ASLR, I don't know, but besides that I cannot find anything.

So do Debian Stable instead focus on getting security fixes released as soon as possible instead? That may be their goal, but they are failing hard on that point as for as I can see.

So, I would say Debian is rather insecure by todays standards.

> Right, so once you understand why Debian Stable is in fact one of the most stable and secure Linux distributions, you can see that it is actually wise to base Tails on Debian Stable.

Debian is definitely one of the most stable distributions, if not the most stable, I never claimed otherwise. And if Tails would only exist if it was based on Debian Stable and stays based on Debian Stable (due to developers choice), then I am still happy with that. Tails is my linux distribution of choice, and although I do not like Debian Stable, *Tails* at least have proved to take security more seriously.
