> I have heard of viruses which install into the BIOS. Could this be a reasonable threat to the secure operation of TAILS?

Definitely. If a BIOS virus modifies e.g. the kernel as it's loaded into memory, there's not much any operating system, Tails included, can do.

> What other circumstances could exist which would undermine security before TAILS is even booted

Tails does not defend against:

* Compromised hardware (Tails defends against hardware keyloggers if the user uses the provided on-screen-keyboard)
* Compromised Tails boot media
* Video surveillance
* [TEMPEST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST)/[Van Eck phreaking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking)

Etc.
