I would like to set up a Hidden Service. 

I know that this will entail installing new software, but assuming that I have ensured the safety of the server software I would like to use, would Tails make a good starting point ?  If not, what would be a good platform for a hidden service ? The icognito aspect of Tails is what I'm looking for. The amnesiac part is easily bypassed with the persistent storage option.
