One of my machines that I run Tails on is powered by an Intel Core2Quad.
I've installed gnome-system-monitor to check the CPU load graphs - only a single core shows up!

Not that I need all four cores to get things done with Tails, but I wonder what's causing this issue.

Anyone else with this problem?
What could be the cause for this?
