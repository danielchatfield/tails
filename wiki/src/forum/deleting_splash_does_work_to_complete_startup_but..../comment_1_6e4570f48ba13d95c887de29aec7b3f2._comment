Getting a new release out is not really an easy process right now (but we are working on it). At the present time, we are still trying to figure out *why* some computers are affected and not others.

In the meantime, just edit the boot command line and remove the 'splash' keyword. That's a pain, but it'll do while until we get a new release out.
