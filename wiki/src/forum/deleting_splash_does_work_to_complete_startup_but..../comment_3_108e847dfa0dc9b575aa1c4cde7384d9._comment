Booting from a usb install. I permanently deleted 'splash' from the kernel boot parameter line by re-mounting /live/image read-write and then editing live.cfg (as root) to delete that code:

# mount -o remount,rw /live/image
# cd /live/image/syslinux; gedit live.cfg

Delete 'splash' from the boot parameters.
Afterwards, remount read-only:

# mount -o remount,ro /live/image

Fixed! No more hitting tab and deleting splash on every boot.
