Yes, that's what I meant in the first comment.

Well, my understanding is that the consensus in the relevant research community is that it's easy. I am not aware of any proof-of-concept studies on simulated networks, but there are theoretical papers showing that correlating traffic can be done much better than it appears at the first glance. I think that Nick Mathewson (nickm) is the person to go to for that.

Well, probably.
