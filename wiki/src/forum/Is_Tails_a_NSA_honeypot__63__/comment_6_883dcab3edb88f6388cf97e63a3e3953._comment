Well think about this: most child pornographers use Tails and Tor (considering the only real CP sites are .onion pages), and if it were a honeypot I think we'd soon know.  My thought is \"If people can be sending such horrible things as child pornography using Tails and Tor and they haven't been caught even with the government looking for them like crazy, then why should I worry?  Even if Tails/Tor is relatively easy to break through, why would the FBI go after me when they have bigger fish to fry?\".
