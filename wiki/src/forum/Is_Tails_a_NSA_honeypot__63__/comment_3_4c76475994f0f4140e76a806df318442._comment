Hang on.  By \"traffic analysis\" you people are talking about having a global view of a significant percentage of tor nodes, right - in effect compromising all tor circuits? I think that might be non-trivial.  Furthermore, you're talking about being able to watch traffic at an exit node and trace it back through the tor circuit.  Traffic to/from hidden sites is quite a bit harder I believe.
