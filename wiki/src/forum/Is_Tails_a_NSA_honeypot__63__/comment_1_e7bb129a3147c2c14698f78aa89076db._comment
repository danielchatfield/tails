I think that the consensus is that Tor's anonymization is easily broken with an end-to-end traffic analysis (likely available to organizations like the NSA). The anonymization is still good for practical purposes, though â€” military intelligence won't compromise their techniques by cooperating with law enforcement. And, of course, there are non-NATO countries. Also, it's unclear what traffic analysis gives you for hidden services.
