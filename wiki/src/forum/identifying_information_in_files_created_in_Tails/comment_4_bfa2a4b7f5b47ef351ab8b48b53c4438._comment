As included in original post, I am referring to files created using tails.

>and the fact that it was created using Tails, can still leak

Can you please be specific? which applications would leave such a trace? Can you tell how to change it for those who want to do so?

The meta-stripper in tails does not support all file extensions. I'm also not sure what exactly would it do to files created in tails
