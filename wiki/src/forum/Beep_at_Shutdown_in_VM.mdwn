I am using VMware Workstation and even though I have Tails on USB;sometimes I am booting from the VMware so that  I won't reboot.

Whenever I shutdown; I hear a beep (The computer beep). Is there any way to avoid that?

(I have other Linux VMs and they don't do this so I thought it may be a setting in Tails instead of VMware)
