There is no ssh server (i.e. sshd) installed in Tails, so I'm not sure what your problem is. We recently switched the default user when *connecting* via ssh from \"amnesia\" to \"root\" to avoid fingerprinting, so \"root\" is not mandatory (that would be ridiculous), just the default. You can specify a user when connecting over ssh like this:

    ssh some_user@some_ssh_server

If this isn't what you want, please try to explain your problem again.
