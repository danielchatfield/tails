Somewhat (?) related, I've noticed Tails no longer let's me ssh into anywhere. I used to copy ID_RSA key to /home/amnesia/.ssh then load up amensia terminal (not root) and ssh in but now I immediately get a ssh connection denied message which means it didn't even try to access the server over tor and instead denied me immediately

Could be alternative ssh ports are blocked with Tails 0.10? (instead of usual ssh port 22)
