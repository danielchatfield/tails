The instructions you followed just removed the stick's partition table. You haven't created a new partition table or any filesystem yet. Just \"format\" the stick as normal to whatever filesystem you prefer in whichever OS you prefer.

Methinks this should be mentioned in the guide! \"Step 8\" perhaps ;O)
