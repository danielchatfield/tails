Sorry! For some reason I read your last line as:

>Can I format it - how can I reset my Usb stick to default ?

It's been almost a decade since I last used Windows, so I had to look it up...

Try these two commands as (the missing) steps 8 and 9 (you'll probably need to perform 1-6 again to select the correct device again). **BE SURE YOU'VE SELECTED THE CORRECT DEVICE!**:

    convert mbr

    create partition primary

From Linux you could use Gparted. [Comprehensive instructions here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17001/how-to-format-a-usb-drive-in-ubuntu-using-gparted/)
