This got me a bit confused. When opening 'Vidalia Control panel' then 'View Network' and checking the last entry in 'Connection' box indicates a certain country (United States for example). However, when checking 'what is my IP' on IP testing websites it comes up with a different IP/location (like Germany). Why is this mismatch happening? Which one is the real exit node IP?
