@ Comment 14:

If you are using a Tails with a persistent volume, if you really think your installation was compromised you should back up personal files and reinstall (very fast, right?).

Then I think you should be able to use the package manager to download Tripwire and create an initial snapshot.  I think you'll need to reinstall Tripwire from the persistent volume each time you run Tails, but this expectation is based upon reading the documentation, not upon experience.

The point about using TripWire is that this can be a valuable tool in quickly spotting \"what changed\" if something did.  TripWire includes some measures to guard against the likelihood that an intruder, maybe even malware, will try to mess with the TripWire database to hide their tracks.

Hmm... one serious problem with this plan: TripWire insists on trying to email the sysadmin unencrypted reports with sensitive information.  Well, there are other rudimentary intrusion detection packages which don't do that and might be better suited, so look around.

You could maybe also install rkhunter, which can apparently be effective in catching script kiddie malware (but you'll have to learn to interpret false positives).  This also will probably make some daily callouts, unfortunately.

(Tripwire and rkhunter: good for security, maybe bad for anonymity.  Illustrating a maxim I mentioned in another thread.)

Then, if a similar incident happens again I too hope you will:

1. disconnect your machine from the internet but NOT reboot

2. attempt to document as precisely as possible what happened using logs, memory, screen shots output of ps, lsof, lsmod, TripWire, rkhunter.

3. if another computer is available, if possible boot that using a forensics live CD and ssh into the possibly compromised computer, and try to use the provided tools to find more information.

4. post it all in this forum
