    * R1 Read or write files from mounted drives
    * R2 ... from unmounted drives (by mounting them)

* R1 Read or write files from mounted drives
* R2 Read or write files from mounted drives from unmounted drives (by mounting them)
* R3 Read or write files from mounted drives from unmounted drives that are disabled in BIOS
