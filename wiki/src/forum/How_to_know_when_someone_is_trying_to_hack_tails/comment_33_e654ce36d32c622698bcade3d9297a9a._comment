You wouldn't happen to have copies of those scripts by any chance?

No, wished i did save them.  They said something about a java script virtual machine. They had scripts giving them info. Seemed like a metsploit payload. I think it could have been from a malicious exit node taking advantage of an exploit in the tbb for windows. It probally got patched by now.
