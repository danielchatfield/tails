Sounds like you're after some sort of \"application level\" snake oil. You should really stick with windows if windows' \"security\" is what you desire. I very much doubt that anyone competent here wants to turn Tails into a windows-a-like security fiasco. The incompetent user can rest assured that the complicated stuff has been carefully configured for them by someone competent.
