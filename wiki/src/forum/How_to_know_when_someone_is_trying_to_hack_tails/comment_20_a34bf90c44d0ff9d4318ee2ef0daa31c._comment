Then we have firmware exploits that can survive reboot, like this Apple keyboard that can be made to log keystrokes. Someone says all USB keyboards usually have firmware.

or they might just corrupt the firmware so it requires surgury to get it working again but at least you know *something* isn't working (for your benefit). I've read of older model computers that have been killed this way but also that they are supposed to check a digital sig before BIOS can be flashed.

If they do this to the BIOS you won't be able to run the computer to fix it.
