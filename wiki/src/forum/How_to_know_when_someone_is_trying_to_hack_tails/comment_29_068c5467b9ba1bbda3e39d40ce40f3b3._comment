... for what it is worth, when I connect to a site like boum.org, I always check the certificate against previous encounters.  I keep printouts of major certificates in a handy notebook.

Assuming you are using tails 0.13, in FF, left click on the icon which appears to the left of \"boum.org\" in the browser pane, then \"More Information\", then \"View Certificate\", then \"Export\".  Save it as something like boum.org.pem in amnesia home directory.  Then open a console (window with a shell) and type

[code]
openssl x509 -in boum.org.pem -nout -text
[/code]
This will display a human readable interpretation of the contents of the certificate.  The last field is the value of the signature.  You can also see the serial number, the issuer, the expiration date.  Print it out, save it, and compare with future visits.

This is not very good protection against possible hijacking of \"SSL protected\" connections or possible DNS hijacking, but it can be of some use.  For example I discovered in this way that torproject.org is completely different from its perfect mimic, torproject.us, which uses a different certificate registered to barkerjr.net, which does seem to have some connection to Tor Project (some posts from barkerjr.net have appeared in a Tor developers mailing list), but which as far as I can tell has no official connection to Tor.  In a recent post on the Tor blog, the author commented to the effect that \"people do try to impersonate us\", but I don't know if the reference was to barkerjr.net.
