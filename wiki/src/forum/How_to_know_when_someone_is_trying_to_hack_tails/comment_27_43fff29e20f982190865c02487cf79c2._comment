Regarding ACPI persistent firmware rootkits, it is worth confirming that if tails livecd where to disable all power management and never execute acpi code, then would an ACPI rootkit never execute

Something like a noacpi line in the bootscreen


I will research this later for tails but last time I checked a persistent ACPI firmware rootkit is able to execute because an OS typically executes at least one ACPI power management command during normal use of a computer


This would make tails more amnesic, more research is needed
