>probably a complicated one that only true Linux nerds could use and understand.

All Tails users get to *use* (and benefit) from it. As with *any* firewall, only reasonably sophisticated users will *understand* it.

Tails is a security & privacy distro. It exists to offer those attributes to the every-day user by combining appropriate high quality tools into a convenient pre-configured OS.

So yes, \"true Linux nerds\" can easily create themselves a Tails like system from scratch. For everyone else... there's one done for them... Tails!
