is there a built-in firewall in TAILS?   probably a complicated one that only
true Linux nerds could use and understand.  i caught an freeware app on Windows
the other day trying to install some adware/spyware thanks to Comodo but i've
never seen any easy firewalls with good GUI yet in ubuntu sadly
