Forgive me if there is a simple answer to this, but I would like to know why - for those of us opting to manually install to a USB (i.e., never using DVDs at any step) - why we must first install a working version of Tails to a 1st USB using Universal USB Installer, then clone+install to a 2nd USB using the Tails USB Installer. to get our final operating version of Tails on USB #2.  

In other words, why can we not (or can we) just stop the process after USB#1 and use that version of Tails?  Is this not safe?  A brief explanation of this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
