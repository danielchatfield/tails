@ OP:

This sounds a bit like something which someone else reported.  In that case, the problem turned out to be that they had tried to burn the DVD-sized iso image on a CD instead of DVD.  Result: ran out of room, some files didn't get written, and they couldn't boot from the mangled live CD which should have been a live DVD.
