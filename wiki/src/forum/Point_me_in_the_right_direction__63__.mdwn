Hi, im new to Tails, and Linux as well. I know Windows. Im willing to do the work, and the reading to learn. There is just so much inmformation, and it is so spread out.
I want to be as safe as possible in my useage of Tails, but there are so many different options, opinions, and some I cant even seem to find. Sometimes I dont know what/who to trust.
I was hoping some of you would just point me in the right direction with what I should be using, and where I can learn more.
Im aware of the things im not to do on my end, but besides running Tails with TOR off a USB drive, im not using anything else, or making any changes to how TOR or Tails runs. The methods talked about in another posting "tails startup rituals.." scared me to realize im not doing anything else.
Im reading as much as I can in the forum postings, to learn what I can from has already been said.
Thank you for your help.
