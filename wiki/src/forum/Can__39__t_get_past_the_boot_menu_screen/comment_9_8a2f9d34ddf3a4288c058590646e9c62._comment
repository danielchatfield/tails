No. AMD64 is a superset of I386. Your machine can run I386 code perfectly. Have you read the bug reporting link you were given?

The [release candidate for Tails 0.14](https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.14-rc1/) is available for testing. If you're feeling inclined to experiment, you might like to have a look at it.
