Okay, I filed a bug report.  Oddly enough from Tails, which I managed too boot, no problem at all, from the same dvd, on an old IBM Pentium Celeron system I had lying around.  So the problem is not with the dvd itself.

Here are my system specs:

AMD Phenom II X4 925 running at the stock 2.80 GHz

24 GB RAM (3 8-gig sticks)

VisionTek Radeon HD 5450 graphics card

MSI MS-7599 motherboard (using onboard sound)

A single SATA hard drive, and a couple of SATA optical drives.

Nothing unusual, really.
