# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

I'd say that the best way is to enable the following persistence presets:

1. [[APT Packages|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#index7h2]]

2. [[APT Lists|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#index8h2]]

At every boot, set an [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]] and then issue the following command:

    sudo dpkg -i /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb

This command will install all packages that previously have been installed using synaptic or `apt-get`.
