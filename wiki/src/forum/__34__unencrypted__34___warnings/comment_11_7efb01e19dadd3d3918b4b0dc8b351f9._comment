Firefox has had a bug they have been working on for a decade to fix the browser's response when displaying encrypted httpS/SSL pages which also contain content/elements that are from ordinary http connections.  Such as sites that serve images or whatnot from a different server than the main SSL page that they don't bother to make an SSL connection with.

In the past half year they got close and had several false starts thinking it was fixed, and I think it may be finally fixed in the current V. 22. (+ or - one version).

Just my guess that the complaint in Iceweasel is related to the fluctuating situation experienced by Firefox in recent months as Iceweasel and/or Tor tried to adapt.
