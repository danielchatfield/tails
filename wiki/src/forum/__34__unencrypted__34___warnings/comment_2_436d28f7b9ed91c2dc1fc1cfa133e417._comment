This is incorrect: this warning means that your connection is not encrypted with http**s** (SSL), nothing to do with Tor here.

To clarify, your connection *is torrified* but the datas your transmit may be [[captured by the exit node|doc/about/warning]] or every computer between the exit node and the server.

Tails can't do anything about this, as https encryption has to be setup by the server your are connecting to.
