>Firefox has had a bug they have been working on for a decade to fix the browser's response when displaying encrypted httpS/SSL pages which also contain content/elements that are from ordinary http connections. Such as sites that serve images or whatnot from a different server than the main SSL page that they don't bother to make an SSL connection with.

Wikipedia does this. How is it a bug to notify the user that parts of the page are not encrypted with TLS or SSL?
