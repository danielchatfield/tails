I tried turning off the computer>putting in the USB> then turning on the computer.  Does not work.

Then I tried for the 'black' page after restart to enter the bios to run tails.  That did not work.

Apparently it's not possible to run tails from a public computer?

Plus the computer needs a pass to log on.
