We've seen this complaint many times. Long story: [[thread|forum/tor_is_working_but_.onion_sites_504]].

tl;dr: If you have a bad system time and Tails failed to sync the system time .onions will refuse your connection. [[Try manually restarting the time sync|forum/How_to_re-run_time_sync_when_it_fails/#comment-9aa1288dfbec8c92a93b1e822254d964]]. For the record, Tails 0.10.1 will have **much** more robust time syncing.

If you have a correct system time and .onion still fail, please [[report a bug|support/found_a_problem]].
