Of course, there are many Tails users who could. A user-created discussion forum would be nice. However, it seems the discussion forum would be more effective if it was on the same site as the other forums associated with Tails. Or at least have the site connected and accessible from tails.boum.org or askbot.org (or whatever the future forums will be)... All I was suggesting. If devs do not create something like that, I'm sure eventually some Tails user will.
