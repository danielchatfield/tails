I cannot blame Tails for not wanting to comment further on such an issue. However, this is an issue that others users may want to discuss. It sure would be nice if in the future Tails had an area for primarily for user discussion. (something similar to liberte linux's forum)... Even if the discussion area is a completely seperate site from askbot or not.
