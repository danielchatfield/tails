>It seems to me that the appeal to TAILS is in it's use as an anonymising tool when you need to use the internet anonymously, though also download files and use those files in other applications. 

The amnesiac design and convenient security tools are helpful too. even when offline. You should read the \"About\" page.

>Afterall, it is my understanding that using TOR browser bundle in a Windows environment is entirely safe, providing that you do not download or access and use sensitive files outside of TOR.

This is sketchy and probably misguided. Read about the potential for leaks on the Tor site. There's also some good information here about what Tails offers that TBB can't. You should read the documentation... but don't ask here - it's a Tor question.

>That is, in a Windows environment no record is kept in Windows of your activity online in TOR; things viewed online are stored only in RAM.

...and swapfiles and hiberfiles and what about malware, trojans, viruses, etc...

>And so TAILS, being effective only when one can download, store and use sensitive files, needs good encryption tools in order to work.

You were mistaken about this.

>I currently live in a country where the government can compel you to provide a password to encrypted files. To protect myself I require use of Truecrypt, which allows one to create a hidden encrypted folder within an encrypted container which affords the user plausible deniability. That is, if I am compelled to provide a password I need only provide the first level of encryption since it is not possible to determine if a second hidden folder exists. Is there any other Linux based encryption software that allows you to do this?

Tails includes Truecrypt. You can read all about it in the docs.
