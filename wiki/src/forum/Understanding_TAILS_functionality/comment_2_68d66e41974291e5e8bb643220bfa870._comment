Thanks for responding, 

Yes, I often overlook things when I am writing.  

I am aware of the potential for leaks in TOR while surfing the internet.  I wanted to confirm though my understanding; that is that there is no risk of information being retained if you use TOR in a Windows environment, where hibernation is deleted and swap is encrypted.    

I am aware that Truecrypt is included, however it was mentioned in the documentation that it will not be included in later versions.  If that is the case I would be interested to know if there is an alternative to Truecrypt that offers similar functionality.
