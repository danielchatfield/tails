Hey, I recommend to all people to download the newest iso file, from 22.november 2010, I used Live CD to install it to USB and it worked. 
1)Install iso file to CD and then boot Live CD
2)start Terminal orinstall Konsole, inside of it you must come in in folder where is downloaded Tails iso file. 
3) then you must find how is marked, named, your USB device, as you see, my was SDC and therefore command for installation was like this:
cat tails-i386-lenny-0.6.iso > /dev/sdc

then you must unmount and mount again USB in order to see changes. then you can reboot and boot from USB, for me, it worked. don't write sdc1 or sdb1, just sdc or sdb...
tail team answered me very fast to my email, when I asked questions and now everything is done:) Thank you! I am very happy.
