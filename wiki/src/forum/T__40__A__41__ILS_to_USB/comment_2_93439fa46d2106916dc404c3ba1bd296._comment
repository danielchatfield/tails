Hi   Its probaly a bit late now   but you could run the whole cd from ram  only takes about 500MB and is way faster  than cdrom

steps

before the cd actually boots into amnesic  press TAB 

when u see the grub command line ( a single line of text commands  ie    username=amnesia  etc etc )  enter \"toram\" and hit return

I will load the whole system into your ram and run it from there...   takes about 3 min on my machine to fully load.

Regards
