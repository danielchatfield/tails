Once T(A)ILS has started up from CD you will find a short cut to an installation guide in the \"T(A)ILS\" meni available from the panel and the K menu, aptly called \"Install T(A)ILS to USB\".



well you know what, there is no Install T(A)ILS to USB option... maybe if you want this to be useful you could update the docs?
