I am completely fed up with Nautilus.  This piece of shit file manager is intolerable, quite simply the worst available.  Even if I switch off all previews and assistive technologies and switch to list mode only, opening a directory of say several hundred items can take FIVE MINUTES and that's running from usb. Meanwhile you can't do anything with Nautilus which hangs up while it's busy! It must have been written by morons.

Eye of Gnome is crap also. Also very slow. GQView kills it.
