> How can the patch mentioned in the link you provided be applied ?

The road to building a patched version of Vidalia yourself is going to be long and hard, if you're starting at learning to apply a patch. I'm very happy if you walk this way, learn how to do it, and report back here, *but* sorry: I'm not going to lead you along the way. Good luck, and happy learning!

> Can you also fix this bug in upcoming releases of Tails?

We'll have the fix once uptream releases it.

> Could you also please address node selection issue raised by previous commenters?

I see nothing in there but the Vidalia bug we're discussing, and wide considerations about the Tor network that are important, but not Tails' job to fix.

To end with, please take it into account when people explain you how the way you're posting may be interpreted.
