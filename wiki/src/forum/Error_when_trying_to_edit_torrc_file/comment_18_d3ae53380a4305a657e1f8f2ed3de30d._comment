It seems that while quick to dish it out, you don't much like receiving it then. Well I never! There's a surprise. Nothing **HYPOCRITICAL** about that.

**Pretending** to mistake acronyms or emphasis for [entire posts written **exclusively** in extra-large type](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Error_when_trying_to_edit_torrc_file/#comment-3914451fa28ccc636d6b38fd9deef60e) does **NOT** make it OK. Neither does swearing at those kind enough to demonstrate to you the error of your ways. Replacing shouty with sweary hasn't made you any less uncouth. Please attempt to conduct yourself with a little decorum. THANX
