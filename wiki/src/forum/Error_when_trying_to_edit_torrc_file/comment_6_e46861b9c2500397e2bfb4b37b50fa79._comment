I've had the same problem, except that I was trying to *exclude* some nodes.

I tried booting with a root password and then manually editing /etc/tor/torrc.  Took a while and several restarts of vidalia and Tails Browser, but eventually it did seem to start using the new torrc file, and when I followed the \"edit torrc\" option in Vidalia it showed the extra line.
