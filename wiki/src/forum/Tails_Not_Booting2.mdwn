I downloaded and verified tails using the checksum from the main TOR website installed it to my usb drive (2gb) with pen linux i try to boot from the usb drive and i get a black screen with a flashing horizontal bar at the top left almost like a command prompt but when i type nothing shows up. I have windows 7 and Ubuntu installed to the HDD of my computer (Asus I5Processor) its a laptop if that makes any difference is there something i did wrong? does it not work with my computer? or should i just completely restart the whole process?
