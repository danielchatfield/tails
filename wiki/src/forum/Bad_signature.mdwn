I downloaded 0.10.1 image but deleted after a while. Some days ago, I redownloaded it again and successfully installed it on my USB drive. I tried to verify the image today several times, it said bad signature every time. I've downloaded it using a download manager (4 or 5 parts), could it be the reason?, but there was no error while installing or using it. I downloaded another one today which passed the verification, compared them, the file sizes are equal. What can cause this bad signature? Is it dangerous or not?

Also, I don't know if everyone have this issue (or is it really an issue) but when I use the ip-check.info website it says "Tab name: window.name is traceable"
