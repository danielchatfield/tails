Thanks Tails. You mean that I must have computer HARDWARE (not PAE as software as the Wikipedia article speaks of) that supports PAE, correct? I found out to do this \"cat /proc/cpuinfo\" and it shows PAE among the things that are supported by my processor. Therefore that means my computer should be one of the good ones with no problem getting a full wipe by Tails?

I honestly don't want to waste your time. I just want to make sure it is right.
