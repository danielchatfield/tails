Civil libertarians are amazed by how far the US Techno-Surveillance State has exceeded Orwell's nightmarish vision in every respect, including *inside-the-home* surveillance of US citizens.  A US congressman, Ron Wyden, has repeatedly warned that if the US public knew how the US government has been mis-interpreting the Patriot Act and other post-9/11 laws, they would be appalled.  No wonder the government is coming down so hard on anyone who might even be *thinking* of leaking (and Congressmen are being successfully terrorized into not revealing what they know, unfortunately).

The Wikipedia article has been somewhat bowdlerized:

     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Institute_for_International_Affairs

See also National Republican Institute (NRI) for the Republican party counterpart, also a quasi-governmental agency.  The parent is National Endowment for Democracy (NED).  All three were Eisenhower era initiatives intended to promote US foreign policy without making the hand of the US too obvious.

But the best information is in some leaked CS reports which describe the DIN and its kin more honestly.  (CS reports are written for members of the US Congress and are non-partisan.  Congressional Research Service is the spy agency which the US Congress created to try to keep abreast of the US Federal government, which is far too large and complex for staffers to monitor without a lot of professional help.)  Some were mentioned in a thread here but that information was apparently deleted, possibly because \"Tails\" considered it embarrassing to a sponsor of the Tails Project.
