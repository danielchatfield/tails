@comment 15, by Tails:

Anything said in a post signed-by \"Tails\" *automatically* carries a certain degree of implied authority and credibility (whether you like it or not, whether you intend it or not).

In light of this...

While I acknowledge that merely mentioning, as you did in Comment 13, that one of your \"hits while searching for \"security privacy forum...\"\" hardly equates to a ringing endorsement...

Nonetheless, if, as appears to be the case, you had no familiarity or reason to trust Wilder's any more than any other *random* site out there, then I contend that you should have *explicitly* stated this.

This contention of mine is compounded by the disturbing situation involving Wilder's use of a *self-signed* SSL certificate, as pointed-out in the linked-post above.
