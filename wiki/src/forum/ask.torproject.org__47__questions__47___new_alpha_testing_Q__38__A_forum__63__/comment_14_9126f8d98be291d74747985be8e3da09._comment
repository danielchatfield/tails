>One of my hits for while searching for \"security privacy forum\": http://www.wilderssecurity.com/forumdisplay.php?f=39

Do you know anything about Wilders Security Forums? Any reason to actually *recommend* it? To believe that it's a source for useful, accurate info? Or to even trust that the site itself is *safe*?

Your wording (\"One of my hits while searching\") clearly implies that the answer to most, if not all, of the above is \"no\". 


As it happens, Wilders uses a **self-signed** SSL cert and the attitude/approach/policy regarding this evidenced there does not exactly inspire confidence; see:
