Discussing Wilders Security Forums or any other such forum is off-topic.
That specific one was mentioned merely to show that places do exist, that are dedicated to some topics that are not welcome here. Pick your preferred one.

Since it's apparently impossible to keep in focused and on-topic, this thread is now closed.
