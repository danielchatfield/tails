In this forum, it would be good if people always left the subject line *blank*. I know this seems paradoxical, and indeed is very much the opposite of what is true for nearly every other forum as well as email, etc.. However, given the peculiarities of this particular software, ikkiwiki, entering *anything* into the subject line completely replaces the automatic numbering that is done by default, thereby making it somewhat more difficult to follow and reference the various \"comments\" (more properly, posts).
