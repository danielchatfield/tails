> Hey, OP, very clever of you to ask about it here, rather than just trying it out yourself. 

I think the relevant message (in essence: this is not supported) had already been conveyed to the OP, and I see little use to suggest they're stupid.

Please refrain from replying on this forum at times when you feel you are not able to keep your temper and answer nicely. (I know it's hard, and I by no means imply I do it perfectly myself.)
