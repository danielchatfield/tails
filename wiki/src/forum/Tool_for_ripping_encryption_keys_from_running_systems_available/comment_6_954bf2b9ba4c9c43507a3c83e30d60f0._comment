The \"tool\" they're peddling is a \"software tool\" - it's just a program! lol

>Do you know which open-source software are affected by or vulnerable to this type of exploit? A list of affected software would be helpful.

They mention BitLocker, PGP-disk and Truecrypt as the targets but they're not \"cracked\" as the headline says. The software merely identifies and collects those programs' keys from snapshots of RAM taken **while the encrypted volumes are mounted** - so this is only of interest in a forensic context. Any other adversary with access to your machine while your encrypted volumes are mounted could/would simply copy anything they want straight off the **mounted** volume. 

Forensic investigators have the added task of **preserving evidence** - so they can't do anything that could taint your data, like reading it directly off the mounted device! Hence tools like this.
