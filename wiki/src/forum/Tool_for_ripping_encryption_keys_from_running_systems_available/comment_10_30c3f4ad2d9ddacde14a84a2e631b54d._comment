I don't know what Tails does about hibernation, but LUKS \"whole-disk\" encryption (sic) does encrypt swap, which is very helpful in some situations.  For example, when Linux runs short of RAM it could possibly move sensitive information like encryption keys from RAM to the swap partition (when it truly runs short, that is; Linux kernels tend to look like they are running out of RAM when they really are not), and if the swap partition were not encrypted, that could be really bad because the information could be left for thieves to find on disk indefinitely.
