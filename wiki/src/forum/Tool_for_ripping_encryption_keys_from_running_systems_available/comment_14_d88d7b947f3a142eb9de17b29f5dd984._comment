>>You'd still have to take precautions against hardware/firmware attacks of course.

Hardware & Firmware: Purchase your gear spontaneously, in person, somewhere outside your usual haunts. Perhaps outside your country! Thereafter: Never leave it unattended and unsecured.

\"After the fact\":

* Hardware: Use the \"maintenance manual\" to strip down and inspect your equipment.

* Firmware: Ghastly can of worms. Possibly beyond my abilities. ;o)

NB: The \"global conspiracy\" types will presume I've missed the point!

>>Swap can certainly be encrypted when using \"whole-disk encryption\"

>And that is what the LUKS encryption does in Debian Stable (and presumably in Tails), so Tails systems should not accidently expose sensitive data in the swap partition, which is good. (I am sure you know that, but another reader might not.)

No, Tails completely and utterly disables swap altogether: The *only* way to *guarantee* \"amnesia\"
