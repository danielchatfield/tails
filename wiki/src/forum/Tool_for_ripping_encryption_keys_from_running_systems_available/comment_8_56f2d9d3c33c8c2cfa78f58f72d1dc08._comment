@ Comment 1:

I agree that this is old news to people who have followed the computer security news for five years or more, but I think the point being made by several posters here is that very few Tails users at risk of serious consequences for engaging in anonymous free speech are aware of such things.

For anyone who doesn not know, the issue here is that (as verified by such public documents as the UNODC report recently discussed here in several threads) when \"authorities\" arrest a political dissident, they try to grab all computing devices immediately while they are still up and running.  The reason they do that is because they can \"image\" the RAM (copy the programs and data loaded into memory).  They can then search the image for things like cryptographic keys which they can then use to decrypt files.  Also, if the \"target\" computers use whole-disk encryption, if seized while booted, the entire contents of the disk are available for inspection in plain text.

In particular, whole-disk encryption of a laptop hard drive is only useful if the laptopt is shut down (not hibernating or suspended) when seized.   That is why at border crossings, guards will often try to force travelers to boot up their computers so they can take them into another room to image the hard disk for examination at leisure.

Software like encfs which encrypts directories (folders) can be useful to limit the damage if a thief or some other enemy subverts whole-disk encryption.
