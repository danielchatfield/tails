When using \"whole-disk encryption\", the bootloader must indeed exist in cleartext.... but there's nothing to stop you hosting that bootloader on a USB stick, flash card, CD, etc. You could keep it about your person or in a safe place when not in use. You'd still have to take precautions against hardware/firmware attacks of course.

Swap *can* certainly be encrypted when using \"whole-disk encryption\". This would prevent the software attack discussed here obtaining key material from swap/hibernation (\"cold\" attacks) - but the attack seems target more at identifying and recovering keys from RAM-dumps taken from a running machine *while the encrypted volumes are mounted*.

What's noteworthy to me about OP is that the software is (comparatively) cheap and that it's fairly universal - it can recover keys used by *several* different products (including software included in Tails). Other than those two fairly trivial developments, I don't think there's anything new here.
