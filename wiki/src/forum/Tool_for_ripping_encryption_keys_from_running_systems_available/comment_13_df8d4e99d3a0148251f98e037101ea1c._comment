Possibly beyond my abilities, but what did you have in mind?

And that is what the LUKS encryption does in Debian Stable (and presumably in Tails), so Tails systems should not accidently expose sensitive data in the swap partition, which is good.  (I am sure you know that, but another reader might not.)

Yes, and I think I missed this point previously.
