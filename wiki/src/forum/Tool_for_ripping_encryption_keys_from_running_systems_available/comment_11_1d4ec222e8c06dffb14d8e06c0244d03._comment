Actually I'm pretty sure a tool very similar to this has already existed for quite some time now, the only reason this tool is getting such publicity is that it is rather cheap compared to previous tools.

I agree completely with that, if people don't really know that it is possible to dump encryption keys from RAM either through this method or through other methods like Cold Boot attacks then it is certainly something they should be aware of.
