For laptop users who use OS like varieties of Windows, Mac, Linux, it would be useful to know where to look for hibernation files.  

For users of Debian stable (or a closely related distro like Tails), \"whole-disk\" encryption does not actually encrypt the entire disk.  A portion with boot-related information must be left un-encrypted.  When the laptop is booted and the legitimate owner supplies the LUKS passphrase, the system bootstraps its way to loading the Linux kernel, desktop environment, and other essential programs. I believe that the \"hibernation file\" mentioned in the cited article in The Register would be kept in the un-encrypted portion, so if your laptop was stolen or seized while in hibernation mode, all your data would be exposed (if the thief realized the opportunity).  Someone please correct me if I am wrong about that.

Linux user forums tend to suffer from the same problems mentioned here in several recent threads, by the way.  Any forum which requires one to register before posting locks out the people who most need the information.
