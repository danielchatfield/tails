hello tails,

just wondering,what actually remains on my usb stick after i have used it???if an adversary were to get hold of it,could they find out what i have been up to??does it store stuff like internet caches on the stick??maybe if i downloaded something,could they see what i downloaded on that usb,even though i have no persistance...

also, theres a new tor update out...

cheers
