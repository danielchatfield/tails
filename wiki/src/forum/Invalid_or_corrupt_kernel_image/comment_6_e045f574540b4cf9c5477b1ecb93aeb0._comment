Mechanical damage to the disc? Have you tried using the writing app's verification to check you're getting a faithful burn?

I don't use \"RW\" discs for precisely this reason. They invariably accumulate damage during use, causing subsequent *writes* to be unreliable. Practically renders their \"RW\" capability moot - and certainly not worth the high premium.
