Tails doesn't fit on a CD
Burn Tails' ISO onto a DVD

The Tails ISO file is currently ~900MB in size
No CD can hold more than ~800MB of data
A DVD can hold ~4700MB of data

If you verify the ISO after download, then burn it (to a DVD) with your burning program's verification enabled, then you can be confident that you have created a valid and working Tails disc.

Full and illustrated instructions for how to do this are provided in the [documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html)
