Hi, great project, I was wondering if it was safe to use the Mozilla extension "DownThemAll" with Tails? Could it leak one's ID?

What about the wget command?

At first, I thought not, because I thought that only IceWeasel and certain included apps were configured to go through Tor.

But then I tried the Links2 browser while running Tails and when I went to IP check sites like http://ipid.shat.net , it looked like I had a Tor IP and not my real one. 

(I had wanted to download Dillo but couldn't find it in Synaptic, even after updating)

For that matter, is there ANY way to (deliberately) bypass Tor in Tails? 

I understand the risks of a user forgetting, getting confused, etc. but there are times when being able to browse WITHOUT Tor would be useful, such as being to able to determine whether connection trouble is Tor-related or not.
