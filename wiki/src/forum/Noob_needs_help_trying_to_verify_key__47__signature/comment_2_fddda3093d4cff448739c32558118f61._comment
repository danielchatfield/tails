Well, the official instructions are pretty clear and can be found here:

https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#verify

Here's my version of step by step instructions for Linux users:

0. At https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html download burn the iso image, the file ending in .iso.  Second, download the \"detached signature\" you will use to verify (sort of) its authenticity, the file ending in in iso.pgp.  Thirdly, download the signing key and save it as tails-signing-key.boum.asc or something like that.

1. (OPTIONAL) Note the certificate of the website from which you are downloading, which claims to be boum.org, as follows:

In the location pane, left click on the icon just to the left of \"boum.org\", and then choose \"More Information\", \"View Certificate\", \"Details\", \"Export\" and save the file as boum.org.pem

In a konsole (linux shell), type 

openssl x509 -in boum.org.pem -noout -text

The result should be a human readable output you can redirect to a text file and print out for later reference.  You can ask a friend to check that they see the same serial number, for example.  You can go to another location, borrow another computer, or try again tommorrow and see if you get the same certificate.  Getting a different certificate would be a warning sign that someone may be trying to do something nasty.

2. You'll need to have installed gpg but if you use Linux it was almost certainly installed by default; try typing \"man gpg\" in a konsole (shell) to see the man page.

3. The man page is rather a lot to read (and if you want to read it, I'd recommend redirecting the output to a file so you can print it out as several dozen two-sided pages of manpagespeak), so I'll make it easy.  You have gpg; next you need to \"import\" the appropriate public key into your gpg \"keyring\".  That's easy: if you saved the key as tails-signing-key.boum.asc, in a konsole (shell) type:

gpg --import tails-signing-key.boum.asc

You should see a message saying that one key was processed.  Type

gpg --fingerprint tails

and you should see the fingerprint, creation date, expiration date, and some other information.  The short name of the key BE2CD9C is also the last two \"words\" of the fingerprint.

4. OPTIONAL: It's a good idea to check that you have the right key.  Point your browser to http://pgp.mit.edu/ and search for on the email of the tail developers, amnesia@boum.org.  One of the keys you see is probably the signing key you will need to verify the iso using the detached signature.  Which one is it?  This is one place where I think the current Tails documention falls down; it doesn't say.  But the fact that the key with identifier BE2CD9C1 is called \"Tails developers (signing key)\" is a clue that this is the key we want.

The generally excellent page

https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html

omits to state the fingerprint of the key we need, but it actually contains the needed information in hidden form: the key we need is indeed BE2CD9C.

Going back to the keyserver and you should see that it lists the fingerprint for that key as

Fingerprint=0D24 B36A A9A2 A651 7878  7645 1202 821C BE2C D9C1 

the second half of which matches what is shown in the boum.org webpage

pub   4096R/1202821CBE2CD9C1 2010-10-07 [expires: 2012-10-06]

except that the expiration date has been extended by the owner of the key since that web page was last updated.

You can now paste the key itself (from the keyserver) into a file and save it as tails-signing-key-mit.asc or something like that.

Now try 

gpg --import tails-signing-key.mit.asc

You should see a message saying that the second key was not processed because it is identical to the one you already imported.  That is welcome evidence that you have the right signing key (a direct chain via the Web of Trust would be much better, but checking against a key server, especially from several locations, is probably about as good as most of us can get).

5. Next, if the iso image you will burn to DVD is called tails.iso (probably it's really got a much longer name), and if the detached signature is tails.sig (probably it's much longer), in your konsole, type:

gpg --verify tails.sig tails.iso

(detached signature first, then iso image).  You should get a message saying the signature is good but that GPG doesn't know whether the key can be trusted.  That's probably about as good as you can get unless you go to key signing parties and can get directly connected via the Web of Trust to a tails developer or someone who signed the signing key (verifying that they believe it to be the authentic signing key used by the genuine tails developers).

6. Fire up your favorite DVD burner and burn your DVD from the iso image.

Note that a very similar procedure is advisable when downloading the latest Tor Browser Bundle from torproject.org (not torproject.us or another website which may not be affiliated with Tor Project and which may not be entirely trustworthy).
