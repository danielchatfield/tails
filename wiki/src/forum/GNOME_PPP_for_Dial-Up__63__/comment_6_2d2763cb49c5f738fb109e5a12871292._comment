Some [[work has been done|todo/Add_Gnome_PPP_for_Dial-Up_Users]] to support dial-up in Tails. Needs to be finished though. Help is welcome.

Regarding `apt-get install`, it does work for me in Tails *after* having updated the packages list (`apt-get update`) which is not shipped in Tails.

Regarding the group matter, the default Tails user is already part of `dialout`.
