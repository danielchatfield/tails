I see GPPP didn't make it into the 0.7 release. Any chance for the next one?

In the meantime, I tried \"sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp\" (while running Tails with a broadband connection) and was told no such package could be found. (Note that it worked fine for me in Ubuntu, though) 

Would it be possible to install GPPP (and its dependencies) from media? If this would not be too difficult or time-consuming, it could be at least a temporary solution to allow people who require dial-up to use Tails. (They could keep GPPP and the dependent pkges on a USB flash drive)
