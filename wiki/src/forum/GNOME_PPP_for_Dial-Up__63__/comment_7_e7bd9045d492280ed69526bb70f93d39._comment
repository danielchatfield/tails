>the default Tails user is already part of dialout.

What about \"dip\"?

In my experience with several Debian-based distros, it is also necessary for a user to be part of the group \"dip\" in order to run GPPP .

(How did you get the words \"dialout\" and \"apt-get\" etc. to appear like that?

The only instruction I found was for *blocks* of code, which looks different.)
