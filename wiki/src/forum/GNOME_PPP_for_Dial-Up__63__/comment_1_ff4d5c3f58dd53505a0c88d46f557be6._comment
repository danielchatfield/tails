Do you mean [GNOME PPP](http://www.gnome-ppp.org/)? If yes, it is not included.

We (or you :) should see if it integrates with Network Manager. If it doesn't, a lot of stuff that happens automatically when NM brings up a connection will not work. E.g. the Tor daemon won't be told it is now online and you won't have any Internet connection available.
