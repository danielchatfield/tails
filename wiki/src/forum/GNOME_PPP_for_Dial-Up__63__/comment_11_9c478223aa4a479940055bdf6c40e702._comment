**Beware**: the instructions in the previous post are unsupported by Tails developers and may be dangerous to use. As explained in the [[related todo page|todo/Add_Gnome_PPP_for_Dial-Up_Users]] , GNOME PPP is not integrated with NetworkManager in any way => your only protection against DNS leaks is in Tails firewall, instead of the defense-in-depth Tails usually provides.

**Use at your own risk!**
