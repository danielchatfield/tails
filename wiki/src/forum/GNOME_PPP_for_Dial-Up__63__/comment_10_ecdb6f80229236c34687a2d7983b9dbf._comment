*Perhaps the following should be included in an appropriate place in the documentation*

For those who have managed to install Gnome PPP to Tails and want to be able to run GPPP without granting it root privileges: 

1.) Open a terminal and type:

	sudo adduser amnesia dip

2.) *Log-out* 
(Under *System*, right above *Shutdown*, which, if you're running live, should be carefully avoided!)

(The password, as I figured-out, is *amnesia*. Any reason why this info isn't prominently displayed on the screen?)

3.) Log back in again. You should now be able to successfully make and keep a dial-up connection with Gnome PPP. ( Find it under *Applications > Internet*	

Note that using Tor over dial-up will likely be *painfully* slow. You'll probably want to disable images wherever you can. Sometimes you may not even able to establish a connection to Tor.
