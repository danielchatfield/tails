I apologize if my earlier post with instructions on using GPPP was out-of-line. I only meant to be helpful and didn't realize there were *safety* issues with using GPPP.
.......

I wonder, though, would using GPPP in Tails be any worse than using `Tor Browser Bundle` on a non-Tails system while connected through GPPP?

........

Would anyone be able to tell me why the \"Add downloaded packages\" option in Synaptic didn't work for me in Tails?

.........

Regarding *DNS leaks*, is it safe to use DNS services like Open DNS, Google DNS, etc.?

Thanks again for all your work.
