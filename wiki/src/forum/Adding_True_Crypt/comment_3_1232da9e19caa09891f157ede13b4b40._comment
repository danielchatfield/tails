Encfs is an open-source package which can encrypt directories, which is available as a Debian package.

My computers can't boot from a pen drive, but one can boot from a DVD and that's how I use Tails.  Even after reading the documentation, I haven't been able to get Tails to \"hotinstall\" (i.e. in RAM) via apt such useful packages as encfs.  I would like to do that in order to be able to use an 8GB USB stick as an external drive for storing securely (I hope) encrypted documents.  One advantage of using encfs is that as long as I remember the passphrase, I can access the documents by sticking the USB drive into any computer where encfs is installed.  (Of course, if that computer has been compromised, the documents could be accessed by an adversary.)
