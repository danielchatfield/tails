> Sometimes when i browse via Tails some websites, they show the following message/screen of warning, and I want to know if it is completely safe to visit such websites anonymously via TAILS

No, it's not as safe as it could be (nothing is, by the way).
Tails does not make this more safe. I suggest you learn the
basics of TLS/SSL, certificate authorities and so on :)
