What you would like to have is called \"nested virtualization\". See [#4032](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/4032) on VirtualBox bugtracker.

VirtualBox, Git, Ruby, Rake and Vagrant should all be installable on Windows. You should be to start the build process directly from there. Otherwise, only two options left: install a Debian virtual machine and do not use Vagrant, or install a Debian or Ubuntu system that will run directly on your hardware.

If you go to the Windows route, please report your findings. It might be helpful to other Tails enthusiasts.
