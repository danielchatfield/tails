I'm a beginner Python programmer and I'm DELIGHTED that Tails has Python and tkinter installed.  I have some easy to answer questions.

 
Does Tails 0.15 have Python 3 (I do most of my programming on Windows and don't know where to look)?  
If it does, where is it located so I can add the right shabang at the start of my scripts?  
If it doesn't would adding 3.x to Tails be hard to do?  

A little longer question:
What parts of Tails are written in Python? 

I probably won't be much (if any) help with Tails development but one of the reasons I started learning Python is to write programs for Tails.
