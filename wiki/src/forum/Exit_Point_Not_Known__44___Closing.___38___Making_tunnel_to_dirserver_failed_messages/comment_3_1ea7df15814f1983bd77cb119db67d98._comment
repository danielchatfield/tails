Don't let it get to you.

How do you know?

I think we all agree that Tor needs an anon-usable support forum, but berating the Tails developers for that reason is silly.

@ OP:

This happens when the browser starts, correct?  You are using Vidalia controller and looking at message log?  Did you use a non-default Tor configuration (torrc)?

I guess this might happen because you have your torrc set to request a specific bridge, but the directory servers you contact no longer list it.  If that's the case, try getting another bridge at

    bridges.torproject.org

Maybe that will fix the problem.
