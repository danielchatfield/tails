Not only is Tails support replys starting to become ridiculous they are starting to come across as rude and obnoxious to newbies as most come here from the windows version of Tor , so it doesn't exactly encourage them to donate in any way.

Why wouldn't anyone think that the error they are getting is Tails related when they are using Tails and sending them off to Vidalia or Tor developers is just ridiculous as Tails developers should be interested in how installed apps are behaving to make sure that there isn't a any new security holes that might affect all users under certain configurations when running Tails and encourage Errors to be discussed here to make sure it's not a Tails interaction with the Application.
