Some interesting bits in there, worth thinking about. 
Sadly your over the top conspiracy talk will make a lot of folks discard everything you typed as nonsensical ramblings of a hardcore conspiracy theorist.

You're not helping the cause by doing this dude.
Typing (c&p) up a Berlin wall of text also isn't going to do much good since 9/10 people won't be arsed to read all of it (not everyone's a speed reader).
I'm not trying to sound condescending but a tl;dr version would be in order if you actually want to reach at least a handful of folks.
