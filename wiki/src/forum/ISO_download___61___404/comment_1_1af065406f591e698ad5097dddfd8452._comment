The ISO images are served by a set of mirrors. Some of them sometimes fail to update correcty and people downloading from them might hit a 404 error. Unfortunately there is no way for you to choose which mirror to download from.

A workaround could be to download directly from one of the main mirror provided by The Tor Project: <https://archive.torproject.org/amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/>.
