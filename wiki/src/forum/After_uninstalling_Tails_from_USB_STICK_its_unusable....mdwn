Ater installing Tails on my Usb Stick

I were unable to boot beacause Tails is lacking UEFI support....




I tried to uninstall it but my notebook doesnt even recognize the usb device.


So I used this guide to rest my usb stick :

After I did this - My usb stick appears only as a remoable media WITHOUT any ACESS

I CANT do shit with it Its completly locked.


Cant format it - how can I reset my Usb stick to default ?
