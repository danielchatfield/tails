I have a working usb tails install of 0.12.1 on a 32gb thumb drive. i am trying to create a persistent volume for the first time, it starts to create it and after a few minutes or so my laptop will reboot, when tails restarts it does then give the option to use the persistent volume but when i try to login i just get the spinning disk icon and nothing ever happens. the documentation seemed to indicate that once the volume is created there will be configuration options but it seems to be skipping that and just rebooting automatically and perhaps not correctly finishing the setup. I have tried recreating the usb install but the problem still persists. Any ideas?
