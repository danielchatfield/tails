Linutop ships a [persistence mode](http://doc.linutop.com/current/linutopOS/security_setup.htm) that can (perhaps) be relevant for some usecases.

The Tails' persistence todo items have been rewriten, so I don't know where to add it in the documentation. Please put it in the appropriated section while it seems relevant to you.
