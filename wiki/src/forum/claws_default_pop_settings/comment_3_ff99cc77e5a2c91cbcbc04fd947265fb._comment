Hi again. I eventually could agree: if the beast *did* behave as you
are trying to guess, this setting would need to be changed indeed.

But it does *not*. At least, not in my experience. Have you actually
reproduced the described behavior or are you mere guessing about the
\"comes down to the same\" thing?

Tired of guessing, I eventually just tested this. Claws Mail did not
delete email that was older than 7-days from the INBOX on the server.
I guess it *would* delete *all* email I fetched today *if I run the
same Claws Mail configuration next week*, which is unlikely and
currently not supported as there is no [[todo/persistence]] support
yet.
