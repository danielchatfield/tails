I don't think it's a BUG, either, but it could lead to users accidentally deleting their older emails from the server, and therefore it should be turned off by default, in my opinion. Whoever wants Claws to delete mails from the server could then opt for that.

When you first start up Claws it asks you to create an account (if your mail provider does not offer IMAP you HAVE to use pop). This account then is set to delete mails from the server \"7 days after fetching\" - which comes down to the same thing as deleting all mails older than 7 days after fetching them (to a temporary mail account in claws/tails).

If the user does not realize it and/or does not turn this setting off before Claws checks the mail account for the first time, the older mails will get deleted from the server without the user necessarily having wanted that.
It is not a bug, but it is an unfortunate default setting that could cause very unpleasant experiences. I do not think that this is desirable.
