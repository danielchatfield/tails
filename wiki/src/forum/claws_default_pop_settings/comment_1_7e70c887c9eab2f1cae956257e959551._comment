Quoting [wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol):

=> In my humble opinion, this is a feature rather than a bug. Those
who don't want to delete email on the server can use IMAP, which is
the default when creating a new account in Tails' claws mail.

Also, I think I remember default settings are to delete messages 7
days *after they have been fetched* rather than messages older than 7
days. Am I wrong?
