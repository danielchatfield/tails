 using it right now and it seems absolutely stable and solid.

 I would however request a feature that comes in handy for people with broken laptops like mine.

 You see in gnome 3.x or lxde there is a easy way to navigate to the system preferences menu WITHOUT having a mouse or if your touchpad has the left button broken.

 A shortcut for system preferences on the desktop would be perfect or any other way you could open the mouse and keyboard controls without having to use the left mouse button.


 Another question that I would like to ask: I noticed that both tails and liberte don't have a firewall (?) at least from what I can tell by messing about with preferences.

 How safe is that? I see on grc.com that both http 80 and https 443 are wide open but they connect to a or ip.

 can someone give me a simple answer as to would tails and liberte be safer than say fedora 18 if you are afraid of getting hacked?

 thx
