I have found that many people are under the impression that Tails is an official project of the Tor Project (or at least is endorsed by them). 

Indeed, such an impression can only be expected, given that on [the home page of the Tor Project's web site](https://www.torproject.org/) Tails is prominently featured under the heading, "*Our Projects*".

Yet, I recall posts from Tails denying any official affiliation between the two organizations.

Whatever the actual nature of the relationship is, it needs to be clarified.

Note, as well, that the same home page of the Tor Project is still "announcing" the release of Tails 0.16, back from January.
