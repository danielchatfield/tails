Tails 0.13 runs fine on my older Dell Inspiron 8100 laptop, however I have a reduced size screen with resolution 1024 x 768, the Monitor Preferences tab indicates monitor unknown. Only one other resolution 800 x 600 is available and doesn't fill the screen. Black bars 2" or so all around the display.  IS there a reasonable fix for this?  I searched the forum and found nothing....thanks
