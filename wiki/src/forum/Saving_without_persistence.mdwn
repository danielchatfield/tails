Someone asked me about this and I didn't have an answer.  Though I have never tried it they claim to have saved files in the Amnesia file folder, without creating a persistent volume, using a LiveCD.  It just never occurred to me that you could do that.  I assume then that the file only exists in RAM.  What are the limitations to doing this?  RAM is a finite resource so surely you can't save much this way, and it seems to me it would affect your speed as well.  Obviously it would be deleted on shutdown, but can someone clear this up for me?  Thanks,
