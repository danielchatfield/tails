Hi, I'm having some trouble verifying signatures for Tails. I'm new to the world of Linux, and seem to be stuck trying to install a secure copy. I'm currently running OS X 10.6.8 and do have older, like 2004-2006 live CDs of Knoppix and Ubuntu, but I cannot seem to get them to connect to the internet on my Macbook Pro. Any help would be appreciated.
