Downloaded Tails 0.13 yesterday and burned the ISO onto a CD.

However, I can't seem to boot from the CD.

I have tried burning on two different CDs, but same error message.

The error message is:

Error 3200 reading sector 393700
No default or ui configuration directive found

I'm using Windows 7 by the way.  Could someone help me out?
