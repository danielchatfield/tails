You can try the quick and dirty guide which worked for me :D

1. Burn the ISO file on a DVD+R disk with e.g. ImgBurn -> http://www.imgburn.com/

2. Boot your pc from the created DVD.

3. Insert usb stick when Tails finished booting.

4. Point to the Tails menu and follow instructions to install to usbstick.

5. Shutdown Tials.

6. Boot Tails from usbstick.

7. In the Tials menu create a persistent partition on the same usbstick.
