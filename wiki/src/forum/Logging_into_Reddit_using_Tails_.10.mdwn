I am talking about the website www.reddit.com

I have a reddit account that I created using Tails and have only ever accessed when using Tails. Yesterday I finally got around to downloading Tails version .10  but when I tried to log into Reddit this morning it didn't work. I can type my user name and password in, but when I click the "login" button the page just resets.

I remember reading a post mentioning this on reddit not long ago by a mac user. People told him to enable cookies:

http://www.reddit.com/r/onions/comments/n3izp/i_am_using_the_tor_bundle_and_i_cannot_log_into/

I have tried enabling cookies. I can log into other sights such as Gmail and they work fine. My operating system is Linux Mint. I don't know what else to do.

Thanks for any help.
