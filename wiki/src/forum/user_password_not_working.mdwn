Using the live cd, the user password which is set upon booting in 0.12 by the user, is not recognized later in the session when required ( I receive password failed error, or something similar). I had success on the third boot last week, and a day later after four boots it still failed to recognize the password I set earlier when it was needed for administrative purposes.

Can the password function be disabled? If not, any suggestions?

Thanks
