I just started using Tails, and I use a 3G USM Modem, but the connection status says "Wired network connection 'Auto eth1' active". Why would it say that? Also, under edit connections, I see there is a Mobile connection option where it would ask for country and provider, but I didn't have to do any of this; it just connected automatically to Auto eth1 when I ran Tails. In addition, under edit connection dashboard, it says Auto eth1 has never been used, which doesn't make sense to me when it has already told me this is how I am connected. Please advise. Thank you.
