> I understand that running Tails inside a virtual machine means that the OS can only leak it&s Tor IP, thereby making it safer. 

This is not actually the case. 

> What I don't understand is why. Why would running Tails inside a VM prevent it from leaking the user's real IP in case of misconfiguration, malware attack etc?

Good question, the answer is it doesn't

> Also, is it possible to tell whether a given user is using a virtual machine, i.e., does using a VM in any way alter the browser fingerprint?

No using a WM will not alter the browser's fingerprint.

As far as a WM that doesn't leak your IP even with root exploits is concerned you are probably thinking about whonix which is a Tor centered OS designed quite differently from Tails specifically to hide the real IP address of your computer even to the root software running in the WM.

If you are curious about how whonix accomplishes that I'd advise that you head over to whonix's homepage and read some of its documentation.
