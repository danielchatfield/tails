I'm having trouble installing/opening programs in my TAILS OS.


I've got a zip file that seems to unzip onto the desktop, but when I click the .exe, instead of the program starting, a box opens with 3 files.  .reloc .rsrc .text


These simple program run perfect on windows vista and 7.  Why doesn't it run in TAILS?


Any advice to get downloaded programs running?  :)
