> Rather than skirt the issue, please consider ADDING ARPWATCH to a future version.

I did consider it, and answered.

Then, someone else added a sarcastic comment that contained a wild guess. Please don't confuse that one and Tails developers.

> IT IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM and ARP POISONING IS REAL AND A THREAT, one would HOPE on a distro like Tails this would be understood and the program included.

Please exactly state what threat ARP poisoning is causing in the context of Tails.

Also, given arpwatch reports detected issues over email, how would you see it work in the context of Tails?

Eventually, as usual in free software: if you want this feature that hard, [[submitting a patch|contribute/how/code]] has much greater chances to work than insisting :)
