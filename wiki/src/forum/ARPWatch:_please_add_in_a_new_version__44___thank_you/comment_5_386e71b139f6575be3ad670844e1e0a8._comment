How do you suppose the OP is the other OP in question? Does Tails include some type of ID# when communicating with *.boum.org?

Rather than skirt the issue, please consider ADDING ARPWATCH to a future version. IT IS AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM and ARP POISONING IS REAL AND A THREAT, one would HOPE on a distro like Tails this would be understood and the program included.
