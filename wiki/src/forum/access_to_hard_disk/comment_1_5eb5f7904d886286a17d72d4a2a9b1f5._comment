> It is not normal that when I use Tails, I can have accessibility to the both first partitions and also permissions to modify and create directories or files.

I have a hard time understanding what you mean: **can you** or **can you not** modify files on these partitions? And what is the problem?

Please also tell use which filesystem these partitions use (I suspect either FAT32 or NTFS).

Protected how?
