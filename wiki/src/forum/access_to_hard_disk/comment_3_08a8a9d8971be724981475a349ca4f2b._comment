> So if I have well understand the goal of a live system, usually you don't have acessibility to the hard disk. With a system live you write only on the RAM. 

Tails only lives in RAM, but if you access a permanent storage such as a USB drive or one of your hard drives **with intention** (e.g. by opening one through the \"Places -> ...\" menu) then we assume that the you know what you are doing and allow that to happen. If you don't intentionally open a storage media, Tails will leave it untouched.
