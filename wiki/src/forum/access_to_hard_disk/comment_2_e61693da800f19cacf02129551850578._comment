Thank you for your answer and sorry for my english.

So if I have well understand the goal of a live system, usually you don't have acessibility to the hard disk. With a system live you write only on the RAM. 

What I said is I can write on my windows partition (NTFS) because I can create modify and delete files.

Sorry if I have bad understood the function of the system tails.
I hope you understand what I mean.
