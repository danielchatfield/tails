Startpage requires javascript to view more than one page of search results, that is, if your javascript is manually disabled in Firefox and you've configured NoScript correctly to block as much as possible.

I suggest DuckDuckGo, which allows you to do google searches by ending your search term with !g for google search or !b for bing searches. This doesn't always work for google, but it's an option. Pity Scroogle died.

If you briefly enable cookies, searching google/ssl works when you enter the code in the box, the same for Yandex search engine.
