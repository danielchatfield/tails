startpage/ixquick does not use google.

It IS a meta search though (does not index sites by itself but uses search engines that do).

Basically it checks most search engines except google (yahoo, bing etc). The more stars a hit comes back with, the more different search engines that page is listed on.

So no, startpage does not reference google.
