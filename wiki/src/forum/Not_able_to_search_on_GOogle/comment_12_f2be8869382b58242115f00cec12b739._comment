* How about reading the text that appears when you click the \"Details\" button, right bellow the \"Enhanced by Google\" icon?*

My mistake, a year or so ago it was a meta search with a ranking system that did not include google as a back end but according to their current site thiis Is apparently no longer the case... In fact I see no indication that it functions as a meta search at all as it only mentions google now.
