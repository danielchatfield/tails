Looks all good. I guess they'll be happy to support, in some way, any group of people who will get this project moving, and keep it alive. (I guess the most likely kind of initial support you will get will be VPS hosting, before the forum proves it's useful, and the collective behind it shows it's alive, kicking, and able to keep the thing in nice shape.)

Friendly hint: \"someone should do it\" rarely works ;)
