Sorry, but another clarification might be helpful.  If it sounds like I am proposing that organizations found \"Revolution International\", that is not quite right either.  As a student of revolutions I know better than most that they have a nasty habit of ending badly.  (Many would probably agree that the French revolution, the Communist revolution in Russia, and maybe now the Egyptian revolution are all obvious examples.  We could argue about which revolutions \"failed\" and why... somewhere else, I don't know where!)

I believe that helping political dissidents to communicate and organize in ways which are hard for authoritarian regimes to easily disrupt can potentially help persuade them to become more responsive to the legitimate needs of the their citizens.  I believe that the turmoil currently occuring all over the world is a genuine \"global grass-roots phenomenon\" arising from the failure of many governments to work reasonably well for the majority of their citizens.  Human rights workers know better than anyone that violent \"solutions\" lead to enormous human suffering.  Most political dissidents hope rather to persuade those in power to risking policy initiatives which address genuine needs, instead of relying on more and more oppressive methods to repress the legitimate demand of their people for good government.
