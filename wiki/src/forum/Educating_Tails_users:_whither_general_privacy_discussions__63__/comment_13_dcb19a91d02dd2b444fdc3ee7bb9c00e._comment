Username and password?

1. Anything else asked? Wrong provider!

2. Anything else asked? Use fake data.

> entering into a business contract with a provider

1. wrong provider. Why not use one without asking? tormail?!

2. who cares? you are hidden behind Tor.

3. when posting a forum you also agree to some rules. whats the difference?

> user account data which can be lost, stolen, or obtained by warrantless demand

Who cares?

You use the account only for talking on tor-talk. All information is public so or so. What's the big deal?

> TOS subject to change without notice

1. wrong provider. why not use one without TOS? tormail?!

2. who cares? you are hidden behind Tor.

3. also forum TOS can change without notice

> possible sharing with un-named business partners

Who cares?

You use the account only for talking on tor-talk. All information is already public.

> is not something to be done casually.

Why not?

> AFAIK, currently no \"anonymous\" e-mail address is close to being truly anonymous.

Mixmaster. Use it to send mails. Connect to mixmaster over Tor. For IP hiding use Tor. Use mixmaster just as a tool to send mail. Forget about anonymity by using mixmaster.

> People sometimes mention Mixmaster, but the developer works for TrapWire, a company which has been in the security news lately (check it out if you want to see why someone concerned about abuses by certain intelligence agencies would be foolish to use Mixmaster without giving the pros and cons a great deal of thought).

Who cares? Use Tor to hide your IP.

Using mixmaster WITHOUT Tor is STUPID! Obvious, huh? Mixmaster can do nothing against you if you use it over Tor.
