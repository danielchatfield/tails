@comment 5/tails

If some users have the ability this would be one way to go. Still it would be an incomplete solution of sorts. Similar to the tails-dev thread where was discussed a possible joint documentation for tails and whonix instead of a fork.

What really needs to happen is also an integrated way of dealing with \"the global picture\" threads not only those SPECIFIC to tails but those RELATED to tails (and tor, and privacy, and so on..)

How this forum happens and who sets it up is besides the point aside there should be a measure of trust (by that I mean probably not the nsa or similar agencies) and that means those who benefit the most should take part in the implementation. I thus like OP suggestion about a joint \"institutional\" effort.

All that needs to happen is for someone to start and keep an inclusive state-of-mind. This forum could, for example, appear out of the discussed possible shared forum between tor and tails. And then why not include libert√© linux and eff and who knows who else? A \"meta-forum\" is needed and tails would also greatly benefit from it.

On Tor-talk you are pseudonymous not anonymous unless you create a new email for every single post and not all users know how to deal with mailing lists. In summary, it has usability problems.
