@ Comments 1-2-3:

Thanks for contributing, but as the OP stated (with links to examples, even) we all know already that there are a range of opinions here about privacy issues which appear to have bearing on Tails.   I happen to disagree with the claims that there is \"no evidence\" or that global surveillance systems are merely \"conspiracy theories\", but let's find an alternative forum and debate those questions there, OK?

In this thread, let's stick to discussing the pro/cons of possible alternative forums.

And yes, I've tried to find some, and have not found anything which even comes close.  Does anyone have any suggestions?
