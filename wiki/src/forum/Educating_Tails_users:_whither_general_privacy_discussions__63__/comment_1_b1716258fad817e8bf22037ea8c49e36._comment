Good grief! Are you conducting some sort of \"torture test\" of your keyboard? ..if so, it's having a similar effect on me.

Wouldn't a simple \"*Anyone know of any good general tech/privacy forum(s) which we might use instead of introducing O/T discussions here?*\" have saved you a significant amount of unnecessary typing and the rest of us an equally significant amount of unnecessary reading?

Anyway, Thanks for starting this thread. I hope you garner some good leads. Have you done any investigating yourself? Googling etc. Didn't usenet used to be the home of this sort of thing? Perhaps there'd be some useful pointers lurking there?

A few thoughts regarding some of the statements/assumptions in your post:

>It seems clear from various comments in these threads that

>several Tails users seem to feel strongly that in order to use Tails/Tor safely, now and in the future, users must be aware of a broad range of background issues which have social, economic, legal, and political aspects, and which are moreover in a constant state of flux, so discussions often require updates,

Speaking from the opposite perspective: Yes, it would seem that at least one Tails forum regular needs somewhere to discuss non-Tails-specific topics.

>at least one Tails user seems to want every user of this forum to focus exclusively on \"purely technical\" issues (so much so that they are unwilling to simply skip threads discussing issues which they consider boring or offensive),

Speaking from the opposite perspective: I can confirm that multiple commentators wish this **Tails forum** could be kept free of chaff.

Further more I can confirm that this is the express wish of the Tails project. To quote **the opening line** of **[the forum page](https://tails.boum.org/forum/)**:

>>**The forum is open for discussions about Tails...**

>at least one Tails users seems at times to feel that the Tails developers are somehow conspiring to suppress discussion of broader privacy issues here, for some dark purpose,

I've noticed this one too... I think it would be wonderful to be able to point him\* at an **independant** forum where he\* may freely discuss his\* theories too.

>Unfortunately, \"Tails\" has admitted that he/she is unable to suggest an alternative forum where broader discussions of privacy/security issues are welcome, and where this forum could regularly send background discussions or inquiries from Tails users concerned about general privacy/security issues which could impact their safety.

You seem to think that \"Tails\" (the eponymous source of many forum posts) is an individual. It's the signature to posts from the developers' shared account. There's more than one developer - not a single schizophrenic.

\* No offence to the female Tailsers - I'm not assuming that you don't exist, just have a hunch that this one's a geezer.
