One other key point: if such a forum could be created (and I think it will be perfectly clear to anyone who follows human-rights-related news or posts at Threat Level, EFF Deeplinks, Big Brother etc why such a forum is badly needed), it would be necessary to allow posters here to link to the other forum, in order to help newbies find useful discussions there. 

It seems that everyone here agrees that this forum is suitable for discussing issues like error messages related to Tails.  An analogous forum allowing posting by unregistered web users is needed for Tor.  Such specialized forums should be run by the developers.  To lessen the burden of moderation, not to mention to deal effectively with legal hazards, a separate privacy forum for general background issues is needed, I think, and if it could be created, everyone here would need to be intelligent and maybe a little flexible about helping newbies sort out where to go for various kinds of information/discussion.
