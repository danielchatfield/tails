Other organizations which might be able to help, and whose user base would (I have no doubt) greatly benefit from a privacy form where users can discuss general background issues like the dangers of booting up your laptop for a border guard, include human rights organizations like HRW, RSF.  Maybe others here can suggest additional organizations.

The kind of forum I have in mind would have to be moderated and this would no doubt be a burden, because to have some chance of keeping \"the authorities\" from shutting down (or DDOSing) the forum, moderators would need to keep out discussions like \"where to obtain illegal drugs on-line\" or \"here is where to share [content which is illegal in all jurisdictions]\", while allowing topics like the one just mentioned.

\"Authorities\" (such as SOCA, EU police agencies, the FBI) will no doubt complain that providing good information about topics such as using encryption methods wisely, steganography, countering GPS tracking, cell phone tracking, etc, \"helps criminals\".  But from the perspecive of human rights, privacy, and even legality, I and many others feel these are legitimate topics, and necessary ones for human rights workers, aid workers in dangerous countries like Pakistan, reporters in.. well, any country really, and other people who are at constant risk of arrest and worse at the hands of repressive regimes.
