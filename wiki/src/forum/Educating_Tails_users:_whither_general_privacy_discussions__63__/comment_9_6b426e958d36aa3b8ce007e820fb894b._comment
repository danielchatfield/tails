Setting up and maintaining a reasonably secure web service of any kind, much less a pro-privacy forum, is so far beyond my experience and technical ability that this would certainly result in disaster.

Very few individuals with the technical knowledge needed also have the necessary legal cover, and may not even have the necessary funding.

I believe that a consortium partnering technically capable organizations like the Tor Project with organizations which can provide minimal legal cover and organizations which can provide funds (hopefully not from questionable sources such as the \"un-named US provider\" which apparently provides funds to the Tor Project, or Palantir, which apparently has provided funds to the EFF) is needed to set up a privacy forum which has some chance of surviving for more than a few weeks.

You are in contact with the Tor developers; I am not.  You are in a much better position to than I to try to raise the issue with them and have them actually respond.  I hope this will be sufficiently easy that you will give it a try.  If Tor, Privacy International, the EFF, and other \"obvious\" candidates are unable or unwilling to help... well, I don't know, but maybe we can continue to ask around for suggestions about where to turn.
