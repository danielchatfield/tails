Hi folks! I just used Tails for the first time yesterday (I have installed it onto a USB stick). 

Today, when I tried to switch on the computer I used Tails with, I noticed that the PC fan is extremely loud (like a hairdrier) and something about the bootsetup (CMOSetup) does not work (I have to press F2 and exit the CMOSetup to bypass this problem). 

Any suggestions how I could make my PC start on Windows like it used to before (without loud fan and getting asked annoying questions)?

Thanks for your help in advance!
