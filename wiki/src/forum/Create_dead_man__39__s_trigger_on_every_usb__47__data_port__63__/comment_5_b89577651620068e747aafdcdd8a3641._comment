I totally don't understand this. Please explain.

Somebody is kicking your door down. You tug the USB stick out and the system automatically and immediately shuts down. A new kernel is loaded, and RAM is then over-written. Boom!

How dead-man is that? What's the problem? I am genuinely interested in how this can be improved.
