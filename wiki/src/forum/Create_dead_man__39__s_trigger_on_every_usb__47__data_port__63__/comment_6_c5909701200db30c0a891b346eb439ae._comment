I imagine this suggestion is intended for those \"corner cases\" in which \"you\" are unable to instantly remove the Tails medium. For example, if \"you\":

* had left the machine for a moment to make a cup of tea

* had just nipped off to defecate

* were already lying on the floor enjoying a quick tazing session

* suddenly found that a lead slug had been used to liquidise the contents your cranium

etc...

That said, I can't imagine that this sort of booby-trap \"security\" would be all that dependable or valuable, even in those unlikely cases. So I suppose it's some sort of \"why not\", \"belt and braces\" concept. The \"why not\" being the creation of a omnipresent risk of inadvertently destroying ones own data. Not a good trade-off in my view and if it is ever done it should definitely be an opt-in option only.
