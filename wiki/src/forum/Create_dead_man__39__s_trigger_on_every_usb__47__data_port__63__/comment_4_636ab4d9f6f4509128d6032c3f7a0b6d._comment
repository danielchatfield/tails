The guys at breaknenter released a tool recently allowing people to use firewire to break password-locked computers and elevate privileges to root that works on windows, mac, and ubuntu.

http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/

>Inception aims to provide a stable and easy way of performing intrusive and non-intrusive memory hacks on live computers using FireWire SBP-2 DMA. It is primarily intended to do its magic against computers that utilize full disk encryption such as BitLocker, FileVault, TrueCrypt or Pointsec. There are plenty of other (and better) ways to hack a machine that doesnâ€™t pack encryption. Inception is also useful for incident response teams and digital forensics experts when faced with live machines.

I think a shutdown upon firewire insertion option should definitely be included at login.
