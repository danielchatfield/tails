> What you described is the way nearly all normal forums work but this Tails forum, powered by \"ikkiwiki\" is different. Here, only newly created threads are automatically bumped to the top. Merely replying to an existing thread, however, does not bump it. The only way to do that is to manually \"edit\" the thread (even without making any actual changes).

I actually though this was the case when I came here too but there does seem to be some element of bumping present on this forum system.

Take the \"Why do we share traffic for I2P ?\" thread for example, that thread seems to have stayed near the top of the frontage for weeks now even though the thread itself has not been updated since its creation, that would suggest that recent posts does affect how the threads are sorted, though you are right that the forum doesn't seem to bump a thread to the top just because of a new comment.
