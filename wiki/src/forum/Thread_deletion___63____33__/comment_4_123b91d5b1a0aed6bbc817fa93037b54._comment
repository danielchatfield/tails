> What is \"bumping\"? I'm not familiar with the term.

bumping is when a thread is ordered to the top of a list as a result of somebody posting something in it.

The Tails forum is not sorted by the most recently created thread but by the most recently posted in thread, so when somebody post something in a thread they push it to the top which results in other threads being pushed further down the list.
