>The Tails forum is not sorted by the most recently created thread but by the most recently posted in thread, so when somebody post something in a thread they push it to the top which results in other threads being pushed further down the list.

Actually, just the opposite!

What you described is the way nearly all normal forums work but this Tails forum, powered by \"ikkiwiki\" is different. Here, only newly created threads are automatically bumped to the top. Merely replying to an existing thread, however, does not bump it. The only way to do that is to manually *\"edit\"* the thread (even without making any actual changes).
