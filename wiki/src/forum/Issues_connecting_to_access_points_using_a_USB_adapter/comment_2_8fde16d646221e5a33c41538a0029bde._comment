Unfortunatly I'm not sure that a Tails dev does own such a wifi device. You can maybe read this page http://wiki.debian.org/rtl818x or search on the internet if other people have issues with connecting this kind of devices on a Debian system.
You might also try to run Debian Live or other Live CD that have the same kernel version than Tails.
