>Any specific reason why noscript should have been updated?

Security? 

Improved usability and functionality?

http://noscript.net/changelog

The current NoScript release is 2.5.5  

>Tails currently ships the version available from Debian unstable, in order to be compatible with iceweasel 10.x. 

1.) Correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the only difference between *Iceweasel* 10.0.7 ESR (that TAILS uses) and *Firefox* 10.0.7 ESR (that Tor Browser Bundle uses) is branding/ artwork.   

Yet, Tor Browser Bundle comes with the latest version of NoScript (2.5.5).

2.)  NoScript, like all official Mozilla addons that I am aware of, downloads from **mozilla.org** and installs entirely *within the browser*-- irrespective of OS.

Thus I don't see how the version of Debian being used, etc. would have any bearing here.
