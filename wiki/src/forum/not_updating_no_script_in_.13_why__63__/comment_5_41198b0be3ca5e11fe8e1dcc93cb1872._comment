Thank you for explaining all that. (Most of which I was ignorant of, some of which I had simply overlooked.)

>The ability to tracks bugs through the Debian BTS,

I take it that \"BTS\" is \"Bug Tracking System\"?

>You can also update it yourself in you session if it's that important.

How safe would that be? 

From what I've seen, you seem to generally caution all but the most advanced users from such tinkering with the TAILS defaults.

>What you may gain in stability you may lose in security, if packages aren't properly updated.

I've seen others claim that Debian Stable does indeed sacrifice security for stability.

I wonder how the TAILS devs would respond to this argument/concern, especially vis a vis its (rather obvious) implications for TAILS.
