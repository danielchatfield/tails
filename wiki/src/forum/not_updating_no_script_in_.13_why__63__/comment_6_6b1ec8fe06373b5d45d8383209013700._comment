Yes.

Well, you ask for a fresher noscript extension for safety reasons, so I'm a bit lost here, and I'm not sure what to reply. :-)

Again, if you don't want to take this path, you can still help the noscript Debian maintainer by reporting bugs and help in maintaining the package.

> I wonder how the TAILS devs would respond to this argument/concern, especially vis a vis its (rather obvious) implications for TAILS.

I won't speak here for every Tails devs, but what I can say is that in general, security isn't an absolute thing, and is rather a matter of trade-off.

For example, it can't be disconnected from the stability issue. Stability is a component of security. Having a fresher software with security fixes doesn't mean it doesn't contain security issues at all. They will often only be found after using the new software release for a certain time. So it's not possible to simply oppose both concepts.
