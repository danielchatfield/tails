Back in January, someone wrote in a (mis-titled?) thread in this forum

> I think that the consensus is that Tor's anonymization is easily broken with an end-to-end traffic analysis (likely available to organizations like the NSA). The anonymization is still good for practical purposes, though â€” military intelligence won't compromise their techniques by cooperating with law enforcement. 

I believe that these claims are questionable to some extent:

* "anonymization is still good for practical purposes": in fact, there appears to be good reason to think that sophisticated adversaries have decided to try to trojan all Tor users in order to monitor them for "subversive" or illegal activity; if so, the comforting old notion that "no big scary organization would be interested in a little ole Tor user like me" is dead wrong

* "military intelligence won't compromise their techniques by cooperating with law enforcement": this ignores the extensive "information sharing" between the most capable "Western" intelligence agencies, including the NSA, and police agencies, including the police agencies of foreign countries allied the nation which funds a given intelligence agency; that said, it is known that despite incentives many police agencies remain unwilling to share (for example conflict between US federal agencies like the FBI and police agencies like the NYPD intelligence division have been documented in press accounts)

* "end-to-end traffic analysis [is] likely available to organizations like the NSA": this may not be always true, but if you live in a country whose ISPs either cooperate with NSA or have been co-opted (bribery, rooted) by NSA, and are surfing to a server hosted by a web host which cooperates with NSA or has been co-opted, it is likely that NSA and allied police agencies can at will mount correlation attacks which have some chance of unmasking you; however, even when intelligence/police agencies (in Slovakia, for example) have access to such formidable tools, it seems possible that they will usually find it easier and more reliable to use a more direct attack, such as simply trying to attack all Slovakian computers suspected of using Tor with sophisticated "police malware", probably bought from a German or British or American company

* "Tor's anonymization is easily broken with an end-to-end traffic analysis": "Tails" frequently cites the analysis by "Raccoon" which was posted in Tor-talk and which was discussed in another thread (until "Tails" shut it down); this analysis uses Bayes's formula and some questionable assumptions to argue that not even the NSA is likely to find correlation attacks all that useful

I'd very much like to reexamine the analysis "Raccoon" and to suggest improved estimates.  One of the most important points which I have not yet been allowed to make is that there are actually several different scenarios to consider, in which our adversary has goals and used methods somewhat different from those assumed by "Raccoon".

I feel everyone should know how greatly society was harmed for many decades by the rigorous suppression for many decades of Bayesian inference, which is so important for such crucial enterprises as evidence-based medical research.  Even now the NSA continues to suppress important advances which would be of enormous benefit to the people of the world if they were not suppressed.  This is one of the huge, huge costs of permitting the untrammeled growth and insider influence of monster intelligence agencies such as the NSA: inevitably, such organizations accrue too much political power and can cow into submission legislators and even putative national leaders who seek to pursue some policy which would expose some prized "collection/analysis technique".  Too many countries have even enacted laws stating that no-one can legally discuss such topics, which prevents anyone who learning the huge social cost of keeping secret things which have many applications which would in the end be much more beneficial to us all if the basic ideas could only be discussed in the open scientific literature.
