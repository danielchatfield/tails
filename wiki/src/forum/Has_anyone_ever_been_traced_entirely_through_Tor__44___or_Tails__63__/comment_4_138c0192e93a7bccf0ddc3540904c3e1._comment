We are all advocates of free speech and information, there's little reason other than possibly trolling to be around this makeshift forum.

That said, there is little doubt that breaking the anonymity of Tor users is something many law enforcement officials are working on around the world, and there's also little doubt as to the reason why. Then there are oppressive governments and corporations which form another enemy to privacy online, for different reasons than law enforcement.

Regardless of who is interested in cracking your privacy or the reason why they are trying to do so, whether they succeed or not is not something you'll find out until it's too late for you.

Nobody here can give you any guarantees about Tor/Tails security. The devs of both do their best, but we're all humans here; mistakes are possible, and whenever somebody builds something, there's going to be somebody else looking to tear it down.
