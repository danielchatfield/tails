> Do I need to do something else first, to generate a public key? 

Yes, you can generate a new key like this:

1. System -> Preferences -> Passwords and Encryption Keys
2. File -> New
3. Select \"PGP Key\"

You need to be extra careful about saving you key (the directory: `/home/amnesia/.gpg`) in Tails since it's not persistent and hence will be deleted when you shutdown. Tails 0.11 will have support for persistence, but until it's released I recommend that you [[save the keys to an encrypted volume|https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes/index.en.html]] which you store on a separate USB drive.
