1) Did running Tails in virtual machine leave any traces on the hard drive? and if yes what it will be enough to do to erase that traces? 

2) When i trying to running Tails from virtual machine Tor did not work to me and before i moved to the 13.0 version its worked to me good in the last version before 13.0, what can be the problem?

3) I read about it ans still can't understand the risk of use Tails from virtual machine. can you explain me and tell me what is more secure, to use Tails from virtual machine? or running Tor normally from regular operating system? because i want to know what is better option for me to use Tails from this 2 options.

Thank you for any help!
