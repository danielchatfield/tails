Would it be private I guess to make an email address without using your name (maybe use tor while making an email address?) and using tor to send the email since its got no id really or not? 

Also would being on an unsecured or public network (library or fast food hotspot maybe?) be better or should you do it only on your personal network if you got one or does it matter much? Also does what browser and computer you use matter?
