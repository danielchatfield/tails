The docs (specs?) say:

You can use this persistent volume to store different kinds of files:

    your personal files and working documents
    the software packages that you download and install in Tails
    *the configuration of the programs you use*
    your encryption keys

I cannot save the configuration pof Iceweasel bookmarks or Nautilus, which are programs I use, therefore peristence is not as per spec and is borken. Useless.
