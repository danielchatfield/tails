I can think of no plausible situation when attackers rely on
booting random USB sticks they've found in order to detect if it
contains secret data. I mean, if they've found a USB stick (be it
Tails or not) with a LUKS volume on it, they don't need a gun to
find out it contains encrypted data.

And if they have a gun, perhaps they'll get you to tell them what USB stick contains secret data in the first place...
