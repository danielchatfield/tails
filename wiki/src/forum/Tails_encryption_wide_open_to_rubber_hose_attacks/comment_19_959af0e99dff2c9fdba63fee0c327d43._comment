Yes indeed, [this post](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Plausible_deniability_of_encrypted_storage/#comment-02859cf61c0cc20e306fc069f6cb8673) makes a really good point.

As the simple fact to use Truecrypt exposes you to this threat, I would be worth add it to the [relevant page](https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt/index.en.html)

What do you think?
