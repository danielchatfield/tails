@ Tails


My concern is twofold, firstly i am concerned about unlawful indefinite government detention ie 'contempt of court', as they will be sophisticated enough to know there is encrypted data on it, but will be unable to prove the existence of hidden volumes and unable to demand of you something they cannot prove you have.

Secondly, i am concerned about the threat that should a violent criminal get their hands on the usb and see a password prompt that it would provoke them to rubberhose cryptoanalysis.

So we need plausible deniability to give the courts what they want without incriminating ourselves,

And we need to obfuscate the presence of the encrypted volume to prevent provoking usually unsophisticated criminals to violence.

Due to the fact that there is no viable hidden encryption solution for dm-crypt/luks and linux in general that you replace it with truecrypt until the luks developers implement this. In this scenario only the persistent volume would need hidden encryption, as tails live design precludes the expectation of user data.

Secondly a simple fix to the existing design is not to prompt the user for a password and allow for them to enter one before the system loads, so something like this:

1. power on
2. tab to options
3. user enters password (may expose password to meatspace observers)
4. systems loads as normal with persistent data or if no password without

or:

1. power on
2. blank prompt
3. user enters password (no characters show, cursor if any remains still), password accepted automatically when correct password typed (prevents questionable 'enter not working' situations)
4. if user presses enter at any time tails loads without persistence (preventing suspicion of password presence).

My reasoning for having persistence load automatically upon correct password instead of pressing enter is that (given step 4) if the password were incorrect then they would go through the entire boot process to find out whether it worked.

Do you have any objections to these solutions? This is the only way i see defending against these oftentimes very real situations.
