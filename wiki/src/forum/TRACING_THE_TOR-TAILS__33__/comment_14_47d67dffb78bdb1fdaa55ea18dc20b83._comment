An unsecure wireless connection is a must, preferably in an area with a lot of traffic (eg open wifi in downtown with thousands of users) A spoofed MAC address will give adaquate protection.

Before connecting to TOR, connect to a free VPN service that is known to not keep logs. Then route the connection through a service like JAP before going to TOR. Before you go to your site, visit some web-based proxies first - preferabbly with servers in Third World countires.

There will be too many connections and layers to trace, even if the FBI is indeed on you. Layers and a variety of services combine the pros of all of them.
