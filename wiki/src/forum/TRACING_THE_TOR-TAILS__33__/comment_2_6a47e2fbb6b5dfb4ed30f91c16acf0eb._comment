I know that nothing can protect from the global adversary but what if our rivals whom we expose for their indulgence into corruption and land/liquor mafia use the law and order situation by slapping false cases against the whistleblower with a view to get him traced to eliminate him later?

Any solution? Can someone tell as to what is the log retention policy and how can someone escape from such eventualities?
