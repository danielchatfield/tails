\"Now suppose someone wants to trace me from my Facebook profile\"

IMO:

If you use Facebook, you're stupid.
If you use Facebook through Tor, you're even dumber.

Ditch Facebook and Twitter, free yourself and you'll feel better. Searching both with or without Tor for interests and people who can be connected to you is stupid, too.
