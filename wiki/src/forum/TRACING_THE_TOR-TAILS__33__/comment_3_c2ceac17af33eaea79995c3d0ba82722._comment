Logs on that levels (standard ISP logging IPs and coarse time) do not equal \"global adversary\", Tor should still be secure in OPs scenario. 

Tor nodes, especially the high bandwidth ones, get connections from multiple other nodes and clients and connect to multiple other nodes or clearnet services at the same time. To reliably \"trace back\" across three hops you need additional information: timing at least at a second resolution and package sizes in addition to DPI that targets and filters out Tor traffic. This level of logging most probably can't be done (and stored) at all participating ISPs across all its customers: It's costly and it would be very difficult to get multiple states and private for profit organizations with lobbying power on board.

Against an actual \"global\" (most tor nodes are actually in a hand full states, mostly NATO) attacker, who can globally log however he pleases or even mount active attacks, you MUST use a high latency network and/or rely on public wifi and physical security tactics and/or use steganography.
