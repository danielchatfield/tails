LoL you want to use TOR to protect your identity, then the first thing you want to do is log in to FB. Well that sounds pretty stupid. 

1) You have to tell all your friends to call you John Doe from now on
2) All your friends need to 'kindly' let their lawyers ask FB to delete all references of your name and other identifying references of your existence also trivial stuff like your hobbies to counter correlation attacks from FB.

Alternatively:
You can ban all your FB friends for ever and create a new fake identity on FB and you will be redistricted to only communicate with people who do not know who you are. 

Well using FB with tor is a BAD idea anyways. With Tor you don't want to type your ID into any website you come across. PERIOD! Btw.: FB is specialized in tracking their users and even people not on FB but known by people on FB.
