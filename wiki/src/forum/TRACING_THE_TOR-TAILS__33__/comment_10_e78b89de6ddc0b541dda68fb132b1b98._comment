If one should avoid using Facebook and Twitter, how can one maintain contacts with the outside world? Why should one use TAILS if using Facebook and Twitter is not recommended? I am not aware of any other purpose for which the Tails is used. In order to communicate with the world, Facebook and Twitter are the only mode of communication. Yes, we can chat with others but only if the other person has given us his email ID and he is online at the same time on Pidgin, but it is not possible to contact unknown people through messengers.
