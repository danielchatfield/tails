This has to be the most mind numbing thread on the forum. I feel quite depressed. :(

The woolly minded naivety of most of the replies is surpassed only by the soul destroying grammar.

Sorry OP. Not everyone in the Tails community has been dropped on their head, regularly, from birth to present.

In answer to your question! Yes, using Tor to connect to facebook is <strike>the *only* way anyone should go near that data hoarding pimp of a corporation</strike> a perfectly reasonable application of Tor. Of course, you can probably comprehend that you're facebook friends and therefore the greater facebook monster know *who* you are, perhaps you just don't want them/it to know *where* you are. I suppose that for one who can't figure out what \"dumb\" means, it's probably somewhat optimistic to hope they might extricate an intention so fiendishly obfuscated in plain sight amidst a clearly expressed question.

Anyway, a couple of thoughts actually relating to your query:

If you're using Tor to connect to an identifiable account you should take care not to use the same (tainted) Tor circuit and perhaps also browser session to perform any interactions which may require anonymity. The easiest way to *ensure* this is to re-start Tails immediately before and again immediately after using facebook or whatever, while being careful not to do anything needing *anonymity* during that session. It might also be worth choosing a security/anonymity distro for use *exclusively* with *non-anonymous* accounts and using a different anonymity distro for *anonymous* interactions... thereby eliminating any possible browser/OS \"fingerprint\" linkage.

Regarding your concern of tracing back down your connection circuit by means of IP address, you've overlooked one of the key aspects of the Tor design. i.e. You're a \"drop in the ocean\". That last (exit) not is simultaneously connected to dozens/hundreds/thousands of other nodes/clients by anonymous encrypted channels. Which of those myriad connections is yours? Each of those connections will radiate across the world to a machine which is also connected concurrently and anonymously to myriad other machines - again distributed all over the world... and so on. Therefore you probably only have serious cause for concern if either (1) the whole Tor network is completely and fundamentally broken/pwned or (2*) your adversary can monitor all the Tor network's entry and exit nodes and thus obtain complete high resolution transaction records for the whole global Tor network.

* The idea of a global adversary being able to use such data and mount a viable \"timing attack\" is considered *plausible* and is presently the subject of a great deal of interest and investigation. Read into that what you will.
