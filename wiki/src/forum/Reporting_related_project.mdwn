Hi,

I wasn't able to edit the relevant section of the [about page](https://tails.boum.org/about/index.en.html#index6h1) ("*Error: about is locked and cannot be edited*"), so I report here a related project I just discovered:

[Lightweight Portable Security](http://www.spi.dod.mil/lipose.htm), activly developped by the US departement of defence (last release September 2012). There are perhaps some pieces of code to get from there, even if this distribution, as the developers, seems really crap (AFAIK, no Tor, flash activated..)

Cheers.
