Rather than trusting the apps you're testing to give you an honest summary of what they're doing, why not *test* them yourself?

I'd be inclined to choose an appropriate JPEG and use each program to sanitise a copy of it, then generate before/after diffs for each of the apps you're testing. You could then compare those diffs, perhaps in a hex editor, to see exactly how the outputs compare.
