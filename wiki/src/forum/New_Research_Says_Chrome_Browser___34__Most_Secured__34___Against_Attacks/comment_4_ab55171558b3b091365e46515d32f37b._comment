There is no such thing as a safe browser, or most secured unless you're using Lynx or another text only browser which is immune to java, activeX, flash and Xorg attacks. X itself is not entirely safe, look up Lo√Øc Duflot's research. Since tails dev's and Duflot are both in France maybe we can get him to look over the current build and fine problems with it :) 

It'd be awesome if there was stripped down tails version that didn't use X at all. Just lynx browser, irssi for IRC, the built in mail system for mail or someting else, gpg command line and no possibility of X vuln.
