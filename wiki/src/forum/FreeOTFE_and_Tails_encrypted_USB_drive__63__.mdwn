I'm using Tails 0.10 and I got a 16GB USB drive and encrypted it using the instructions in the documentation.  Tails is able to read and write files to the encrypted, ext4 formatted drive and when I insert it into other computers it looks unformatted.  Everything works the way it's supposed to.  

How can I read the encrypted drive in other operating systems?  I got FreeOTFE 5.21 (http://www.freeotfe.org/) installed under 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate and it's supposed to be able to read encrypted (LUKS, cryptoloop, dm-cypher) USB drives but I have no idea which settings to use.  Should I try to read just the partition or the entire drive?  What key processing hash method do I use, SHA1-512?  Is Tails using AES-256 bit CBC, LRW, XTF or an entirely different encryption method?  What IV generation sector IV should I use, 32-bit sector ID?  Should I mount it as a fixed disk or removable disk or does it matter?
