What I meant is exactly what I said, i.e. the command completed with nothing actually deposited onto the USB.

The USB was a PNY that was was originally formatted with a MBR and a vfat 32 partition.  I had to unformat the USB with the Disk Utility, and then the dd command worked perfectly - and the USB boots as intended.
