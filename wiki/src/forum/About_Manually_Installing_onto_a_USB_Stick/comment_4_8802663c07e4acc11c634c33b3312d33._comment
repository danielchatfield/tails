> Is there any downside to using dd as the OP described?

The `dd` and `cat` approaches should both be equivalent. Make sure to read [[the relevant documentation|doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/linux]] before doing this, though.

> 1.) Which file system should one format the USB drive to? (ext2, ext3, ext4, FAT, etc.)

When doing a raw copy like this creating partitions and formating them are pointless as the partition table will be overwritten. You do not have to do anything like this.

> 2.) What is the minimum size USB drive for installing the ISO to? (Not for persistence)

The size of the ISO file.
