First of all, I'm an uber-noob when it comes to these types of things so please be patient with me.
I downloaded 0.7.2 & the USB installer. I followed the directions on installing it onto a flash drive and it told me everything installed successfully. However, I can't figure out how to open the OS from the flash drive. Every time i open autorun it just takes me to the tails.org website.
I'm running windows 7 (64 bit) and my usb drive is formatted as FAT32. Help!
