After testing and searching I tried \"blacklist=firewire_ohci\" and now V.0.10 boots until blue/white progress bar fully deployed and vanished, just to remain with a black screen without accepting any keyboard input. Only way out the Power Button.
BTW V.0.9 works without problems.

Any help would be appreciated.
