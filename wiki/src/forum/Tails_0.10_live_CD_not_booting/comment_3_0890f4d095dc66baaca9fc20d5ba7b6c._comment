Thank you for replying. Downloaded Tails 0.11, installed it using Universal-USB-installer and tried to boot (also in failsafe-mode). Result remains the same. Without adding \"blacklist=firewire_ohci\" it would not even get as far as loading the kernel. The progress bar would stop at about 60% showing Debian 6.0.4 and then freezes up.
No chance to get a terminal, so debug mode does not allow to get any data.
Is there any possibility to have \"debug\" store the log?
By the way, trying to use the left arrow key at the command line would duplicate the first two lines at any single character of moving back.
Thanks for attention, I can be back only by monday
