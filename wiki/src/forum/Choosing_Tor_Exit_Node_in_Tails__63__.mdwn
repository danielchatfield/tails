Is it possible to select exactly the Tor exit node tails uses? I know its possible in Tor browser using Vidalia. Problem is sometimes I need my IP to stay the same while im using some online services, like online email, otherwise if my IP keeps changing, they think my account has been hacked because they keep seeing IP addresses from all over the world logging into it so they suspend the account due to "suspicious activity". I need the IP to not change or at least be from the same geographic area (like same city) so that I dont have these types of problems. Is this possible in Tails?
