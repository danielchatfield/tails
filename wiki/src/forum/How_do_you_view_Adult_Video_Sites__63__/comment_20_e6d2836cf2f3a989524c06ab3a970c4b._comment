Flash is slowly dying (thank God!).   It is a horrible PoS and has been a pain in all kinds of ways since its birth.   Unfortunately, like the monster at the end of an Alien movies, it's not completely dead yet.  It can be used to make page scraping for media files harder eg hard for add-ons that extract content.  It's just a question of time before we see the end of Flash I think.  We can thank Steve Jobs and YouTube for pushing html5 at Flash's expense.

Javascript can build a page on the fly and make scraping media links difficult too, short of running the page on a virtual js engine.

If OP is desperate for some kind of pron that requires Flash, make sure it is legal pron where you are 'coz Flash is risky.  It's rare that some kind of pron is confined to one site.  I'd just look for a non-Flash site providing the desired material instead.
