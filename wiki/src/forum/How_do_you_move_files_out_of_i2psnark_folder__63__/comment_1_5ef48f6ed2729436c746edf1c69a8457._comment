Yeah, i2psnark doesn't make it easy for us to solve this in a good way. Try starting nautilus in the following way: 

    gksu nautilus /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/i2psnark

I just tried, and that works for me.

You can. In the persistence configuration tool, add `/var/lib/i2p` as a [[custom directory|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#index10h2]]. This will also save the i2p netDb etc. which should speed up the i2p bootstrap significantly. At some point we will add a default preset for i2p in the persistence configuration tool.
