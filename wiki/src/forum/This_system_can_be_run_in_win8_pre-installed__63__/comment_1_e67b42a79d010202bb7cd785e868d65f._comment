If I read this \"todo\" item correctly

      https://tails.boum.org/todo/UEFI/

it seems that a version of Tails which can overcome UEFI will appear eventually, but that currently you may not be able to use Tails on a machine which gives you that error, at least not without doing some research on your own.  Tails is closely based upon Debian linux, and I have heard that the Linux Foundation offers workarounds for people who encounter problems related to UEFI while trying to boot linux.  So you might look into that.
