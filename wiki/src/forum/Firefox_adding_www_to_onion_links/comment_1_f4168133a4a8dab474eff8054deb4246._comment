This looks like a Firefox feature that plays against us. This behaviour could probably be fixed in Torbutton or Torbrowser. I suggest looking for bug reports there, and filing a wishlist one if you can't find an existing report. I'm sure they'll welcome a good patch that implements what you want, by the way :)
