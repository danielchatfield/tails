I need to use 2 computers at the same time, one running tails and the other mainly using windows. to make this more practical it would be good if I could use vnc to access the machine running tails from the windows machine. I've had vnc servers running on tails but cann only connect to them from the local machine. I'm guessing I need to alter the firewall/iptables but not sure how.
