I just started using Tails, and I love it. However I have a few concerns:

1 Can network admins see traffic?

If I'm using a public network, I understand network admins can see I'm using Tor. If I'm using iceweasel and https everywhere, they can only see the LAN-port or wifi router the request is coming from and the entry node, correct?

2 Can network admins tell when I'm downloading something, and will I plug up the network?

By this I mean can they tell distinguish between browsing(many requests?) and downloading(1 request?); I suspect they can guess, if only based on the bandwidth I'm using (I'm a newb, so please forgive any incorrect terminology). Is that more or less correct? I also don't want to be a hog, for either the local network or the Tor network. What's the best way to download stuff over Tor?

3 How much do I have to worry about spyware comprimising security?

If I download word non-executable files like documents, videos, music, from relatively trustworthy sources, how much do I need to worry about getting malware? Are there many known exploits for Tails or the version of Debian its based off of? And if I do get some sort of malware, how would I know, and how could I ensure that it doesn't replicate into other files? I'm always worried I'll download a bad file and not be able to get rid of it. Is this even possible?

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks to everyone working on Tails.
