Hello all

I have installed Tails 0.17 and tested its iceweasel for browser fingerprinting.

If you are unfamiliar with what browser fingerprinting is then read the following links:

and here: https://www.pcworld.com/article/188161/browserfingerprint.html

Many other material about the topic is available on the internet if you search "browser fingerprint".


The site I used for testing is: https://panopticlick.eff.org/

The results came as follows:

1. **Default** settings for Tails 0.17 iceweasel which are: "Allow scripts globally" in noscript button - "accept cookies from sites" **ticked** in **edit** >>> **preferences** >>> **privacy**

Result of **1. (Default settings)**:  only one in **114,000** browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.

2. **Changed** settings for Tails 0.17 iceweasel which are: "Allow scripts globally" in noscript button - "accept cookies from sites" **unticked** in **edit** >>> **preferences** >>> **privacy**

Result of **2. (Changed settings)**:  only one in **688,000** browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.


3. **Changed** settings for Tails 0.17 iceweasel which are: "Forbid scripts globally" in noscript button - "accept cookies from sites" **ticked** in **edit** >>> **preferences** >>> **privacy**

Result of **3. (Changed settings)**:  only one in **11,000** browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.


4. **Changed** settings for Tails 0.17 iceweasel which are: "Forbid scripts globally" in noscript button - "accept cookies from sites" **unticked** in **edit** >>> **preferences** >>> **privacy**

Result of **4. (Changed settings)**: only one in **5,121** browsers have the same fingerprint as yours.

**Best** result came with number 4. which is when you disable scripts globally (that includes javascript) and disabling cookies.

I only tried the 4 mentioned combinations.

There are other combinations that you can come up with and test  with https://panopticlick.eff.org/ to find results.

Sharing would be nice. Please tell what you think.
