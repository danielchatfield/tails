I think the OP meant to suggest keeping the keyring in an encrypted container which is kept unmounted except when

* not connected to the internet
* actually using GPG

It should be possible to use the instructions in this Tails documentation page

* <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html>

However, there may be some advantages to using a strong crypto algorithm other than AES, such as Twofish.  

Because GPG secret keys and revocation certificates are so sensitive (but so tempting to keep handy) these are good candidates for taking the trouble to secure in \"Russian doll\" fashion, by putting them in an encrypted container inside an encrypted volume.  Note: when nesting encrypted containers (or superenciphering enciphered files) it is wise to never use the same password, and event to use different algorithms.

Some time ago I noticed that many crypto-using Debian packages (including encfs) removed options to use crypto other than AES, such as Camellia, Twofish, Serpent, Blowfish.  I wish I knew why.  AES is fast and very widely deployed but the Rijndael algorithm has a property which worries many cryptographers, so it would be a very good idea to have alternatives ready to go.  Best of all might be elliptic curve cryptography.
