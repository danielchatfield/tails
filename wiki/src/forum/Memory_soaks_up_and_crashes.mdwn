Twice now have found tails freezing to the point of a reboot, also a few times prior crashing on what was probably a dodgy webpage (what looked like wikileaks twitter advert links - if these exist, causing the browser to freeze and crash Tails - some sort of browser malware that manages to hack FF 10 I would guess).

The first time the processor was 100% in use at the point of the crash but with nothing running that would warrant it, the second memory was maxed out before the crash (the system monitor widget).

Will keep an eye on the situation at this point.
