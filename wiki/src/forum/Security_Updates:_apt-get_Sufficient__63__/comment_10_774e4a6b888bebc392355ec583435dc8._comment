I would love to keep my system update and installed programs after rebooting.


1. Does this endanger my anonymity because i have software installed others have not?

2. How do i do it?

3. I am kind of worried now because i read it could replace TAILS config files.
   Or that certain software could walk around TAILS. - Is there an option to \"hardwire\" TAILS so it has absolutely no way other than the TOR Network?

Thanks in Advance, and i Love TAILS! :-)
