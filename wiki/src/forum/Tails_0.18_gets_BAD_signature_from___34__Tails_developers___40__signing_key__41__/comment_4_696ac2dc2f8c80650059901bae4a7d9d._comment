Last night I downloaded via torrent, verified the signature, and it looks like I have the same sha256 hash as I see on this link 

<https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html#download.verify-the-iso-image-using-other-operating-systems>

This is the hash I copied from the link. 4650157cc4ba292b06c7ef8368e9076600359c3cafc4f2e690b3fe22cc015869

>I re-opened the torrent file and after re-downloading some chunks I tried to verify it again and it was still bad. Hmm. odd?

As I recall, a bittorrent client would show a completed download as like 98% complete when it was re-added, but the file would not change when it reached 100%. Did you actually check a hash to see that \"more chunks\" were added? 

Did you verify the sig of the torrent file? Here is the torrent file sig in case you missed it.

Did you use your bittorrent client to rescan the download to see if it was corrupt according to the torrent file?
