I also downloaded tails 0.18 (torrent) and had the same error:

gpg --keyid-format long --verify tails-i386-0.18.iso.pgp tails-i386-0.18.iso
gpg: Signature made Thu 16 May 2013 07:58:32 AM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key 1202821CBE2CD9C1
gpg: BAD signature from \"Tails developers (signing key) <tails@boum.org>\"


I re-opened the torrent file and after re-downloading some chunks I tried to verify it again and it was still bad. Hmm. odd?
