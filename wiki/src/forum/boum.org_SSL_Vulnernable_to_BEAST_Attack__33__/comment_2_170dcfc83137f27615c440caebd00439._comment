I had recalled torproject.org being reported as NOT being vulnerable to the BEAST attack when I had checked yesterday, but now I just tested again at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html and torproject.org is reported as being vulnerable to the BEAST attack. So I guess either I had remembered incorrectly or the status did indeed change sometime over the last 18 hours or so.

On the bright side, the Qualys reports for both boum.org as well as torproject.org otherwise appeared quite good; other than BEAST, I saw no other highlighted vulnerabilities.

This is in stark contrast to safe-mail.net as well as at least three different major merchants that I checked.

I wonder how much of a threat is actually posed by BEAST and how it compares with the underlying, inherent vulnerability of the CA system itself-- a vulnerability that we have already seen exploited-- more than once. 

Perhaps the threat that should be of greatest concern when using Tor is that of MITM?

Note that the report for safe-mail.net not only showed vulnerability to BEAST but a number of other vulnerabilites as well-- including, 
*\"This server is vulnerable to MITM attacks because it supports insecure renegotiation\"*

Lavabit.com (another such email provider), while reporting as vulnerable to BEAST, did not appear to have any of the other highlighted vulnerabilities that safe-mail.com did.

In contrast, fastmail.fm, mail.google.com, as well as encrypted.google.com , not only all reported as NOT being vulnerable to BEAST, but were actually the highest-rated of the roughly ten to fifteen domains that I have checked at the Qualys site thus far.
