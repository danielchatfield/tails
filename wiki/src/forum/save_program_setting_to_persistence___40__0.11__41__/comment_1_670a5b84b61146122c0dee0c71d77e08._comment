iceweasel and related settings should work if the obvious /home/amnesia/.mozilla folders are made persistent. I don't know for the others - trial and error?

However, you will want to start fresh with your settings each time Tails is updated as it's likely that the base configurations for things like Iceweasel will change frequently.

If you have any success with custom persistent folders pleas add it to this thread:
