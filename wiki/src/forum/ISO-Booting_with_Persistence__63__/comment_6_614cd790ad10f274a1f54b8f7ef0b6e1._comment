I merely followed the guide so far. .ISO's \"syslinux.cfg\" is probably above me. I tried to get other distributions to work as well, ubuntu has a completely different menuentry [for example](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot/Examples) - it works, but other stuff from the same page like SystemRescueCD doesn't. And so don't most of the entries I googled myself. Even if they were for the exact same ISO. I used Ubuntu for installing grub 1.99. Is that my failure?

Help on ISO persistence for Tails + location of bootcodes would be greatly appreciated! :)
