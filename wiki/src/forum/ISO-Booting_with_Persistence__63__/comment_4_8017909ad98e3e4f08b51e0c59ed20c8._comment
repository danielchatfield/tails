I agree.

The problem (well, the obvious one I can see anyway) is that from time to time the kernel boot arguments change.

The boot-the-kernel-directly-from-within-an-ISO-image method, while immensely nifty, bypasses the \"official\" boot menu provided on the ISO. Instead one has *their own* set of parameters within *their own* grub.cfg - So when the arguments change on the ISO, those changes will be ignored on your system until you add them to your grub.cfg

A good example was the release of 0.11. The root password was changed from being a pre-set \"amnesia\" to something the user specified at the \"greeter\". People migrating from 0.10 found themselves unable to mount internal filesystems or connect to networks until they added \"nox11autologin\" to their consigs and thus presented themselves with the greeter and an opportunity to create a root password.

The consequences of this are just a small additional burden of diligence and maintenance: after downloading an updated Tails .iso, one must first confirm its authenticity, as always, using the sig file. Next it's necessary to have a quick peep at the .ISO's \"syslinux.cfg\" to see if there are any changes to transplant into the local grub.cfg

It's not an immense task by any means but it's a task and there's plenty scope for error. I think it's this factor alone which represents enough of a deviation for the method to be \"unsupported.\" Not bad, stupid, wrong, dangerous or anything worrying... just \"unsupported\". If you have the wherewithal to install grub2 and configure it to boot the .iso file correctly, you're certainly up to the task of maintaining that configuration. We just can't expect \"the devs\" to hold our hands.
