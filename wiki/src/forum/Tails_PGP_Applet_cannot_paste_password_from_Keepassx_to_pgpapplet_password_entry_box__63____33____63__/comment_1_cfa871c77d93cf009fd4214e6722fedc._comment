Hi,

I faced the same problem, so I opened a [[todo item|todo/PGP_Applet_cannot_paste_password_from_Keepassx/]].

> I like to know if this a problem i have locally or has this been modified because it was working just fine in 0.16?

Are you sure of that? Because if I recall correctly, the same problem was occuring with Taill 0.16.

Greetings,  
Tom
