Hi,

I had no problems with 0.16 I even stepped back from 0.17 to 0.16 to be able to copy/paste my password into the pgpapplet entry box.

In release 0.15 I had this problem as well but than it occurred just once every while, not persistant as i face in 0.17.

I reflashed my stick multiple times but this had no effect. I am ok for now using 0.16 but offcourse it's far from ideaal having to use a outdated release.
Let's see if there is a built up in complains regarding this problem i face.

Any sugestions are welcome...
