This is a pinentry feature. I'm sorry it causes user experience regressions.
For [[details and resolution plans|todo/pinentry_vs._paste]].
(Note that I've renamed the todo item someone had created, to

It's easy to help: please test if the KeePassX auto-type feature
workaround works, and report back.
