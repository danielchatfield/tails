I use Tails with persistency enabled. I also store a keyring in the included seahorse "Passwords and Encryption keys" application.

The option to export the keyring is greyed out, so I cannot create a backup this way.
I tried to locate the keyring file manually, found something in.

I found the corresponding keyfile in /home/amnesia/.gnome2/keyrings, but if try to import that file again for testing purposes, I get the error "invalid file format".

TL;DR:

How do I properly backup/export a keyring in Tails? Why is the export feature disabled?
