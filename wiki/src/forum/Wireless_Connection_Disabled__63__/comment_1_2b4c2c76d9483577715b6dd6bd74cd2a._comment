Sounds like your wireless card (chipset) is not supported by TAILS.

You might want to try a USB wireless adapter. (In the U.S., you can get one for $10- or less, and a really *good* one for no more than $20-) Check reviews and do some searching first. Any WiFi adapter that works out-of-the-box in major distros such as Ubuntu, Mint, etc., should work in TAILS. 

I've found the WiFi support in TAILS to be one of -- if not *the*-- best of all of the GNU/Linux distros that I've tried.

Thus, I would suspect that most WiFi cards that are not supported by TAILS would fall into one or more of the following categories:

- very new
- very old
- relatively obscure; not widely used
