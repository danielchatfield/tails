> I have two suggestions for Tails Greeter. First when you get to the yes/no for advanced options, have a timer with a few seconds that defaults to no if there isn't an answer before the time expires, this would allow unattended booting.

Added todo item [tails-greeter: add timeout](https://tails.boum.org/todo/tails-greeter:_add_timeout/).

> Second if Tails detects an encrypted drive also add a password entry box and add a check box for the option to use the decrypted drive as the home directory. Doing so would let those who are booting from non-writable media (CD/DVD) to have persistence.

Tails already supports [[a more refined persistence concept|doc/first_steps/persistence]] than this (which also supports makeing `/home` persistent, but that's a bad idea since it will prevent updated configs from new Tails releases).
