As I wrote my previous post I was concerned that too much focus would be put on the bookmark example, which is why I gave two other examples and also that I would sound like I was complaining rather than explaining.   
 
My solution would be to add to the Tails Greeter encrypted hard drive detection, a password entry box, a check box for using the decrypted drive as a home directory and leaving them blank would continue with defaults if a timer wasn't reached.  If I tried to create this myself it would take so long and be so poorly written the code would be unacceptable and someone else would have to re-write it.
