>Tails already supports a more refined persistence concept than this (which also supports makeing /home persistent, but that's a bad idea since it will prevent updated configs from new Tails releases).

Let's make sure there's no misunderstandings.  

Here is an example of what I was referring to. I boot from a non-USB source and have an encrypted hard drive.  To access my Iceweasel bookmarks I...

* Click Bookmarks on the menu bar
* Choose Show All Bookmarks 
* Click Import and Backup V
* Go to Restore >
* Click Choose File...
* Click the encrypted drive
* Enter the password
* Click the checkbox to remember the password for this session
* Click OK
* Wait for the drive to become available
* Scroll down to the bookmark file
* Click Open
* Click OK when asked if I want to replace all my bookmarks

	
Two other examples, each program I use defaults to opening files on amnesia instead of the encrypted drive.  If I want to install a different program than one of the defaults that comes with Tails I have to add the package each time I boot.  

Having my anonymity protected by Tails makes the effort of the work-around  worthwhile but it's inconvenient on the user end.  Couldn't this issue be solved by having Tails detect an encrypted drive at boot time, request the password and optionally use that drive in place of amnesia?  

You said that configuration files would be prevented from being updated each time a new version of Tails is released.  Does this mean that with each new version of Tails the user needs to format the USB drive Tails is installed on, losing all configuations, working documents, installed software and encryption keys?
