Nested VMs... nice :). My guess is that there's some issue with Tails' VirtualBox mouse integration in that situation. This is a pretty difficult situation to debug, and frankly not a use-case we can expend extra energy on, so your best hope is that some future upgrade of virtualbox (either your Virtualbox host software or the guest-additions we ship in Tails) will fix this. Sorry.

I'm curious, why not boot Tails in a non-nested VM?
