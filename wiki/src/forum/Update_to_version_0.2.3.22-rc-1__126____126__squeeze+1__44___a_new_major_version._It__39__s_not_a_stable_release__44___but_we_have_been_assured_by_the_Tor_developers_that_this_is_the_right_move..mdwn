is this wise?

i won't quote it all, but:

>Tor 0.2.4.4-alpha adds a new v3 directory authority, fixes a privacy
vulnerability introduced by a change in OpenSSL, fixes a remotely
triggerable assert, and adds new channel_t and circuitmux_t abstractions
that will make it easier to test new connection transport and cell
scheduling algorithms.

>Major bugfixes (security/privacy, also in 0.2.3.23-rc):
    - Disable TLS session tickets. OpenSSL's implementation was giving
      our TLS session keys the lifetime of our TLS context objects, when
      perfect forward secrecy would want us to discard anything that
      could decrypt a link connection as soon as the link connection
      was closed. Fixes bug 7139; bugfix on all versions of Tor linked
      against OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later. Found by Florent DaigniÃ¨re.
    - Discard extraneous renegotiation attempts once the V3 link
      protocol has been initiated. Failure to do so left us open to
      a remotely triggerable assertion failure. Fixes CVE-2012-2249;
      bugfix on 0.2.3.6-alpha. Reported by "some guy from France".
