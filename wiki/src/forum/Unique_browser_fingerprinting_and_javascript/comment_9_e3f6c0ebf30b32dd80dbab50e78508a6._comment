>\"Forbid scripts globally\" on the NoScript button on the browser!

I have tried to forbid scripts globally and you know what? The following problems cropped up:

- After entering some data into a box and pressing the \"Submit\" button, the web page just hanged there (froze).
- The button(s) that I clicked on refused to respond.

What should I do under such circumstances?
