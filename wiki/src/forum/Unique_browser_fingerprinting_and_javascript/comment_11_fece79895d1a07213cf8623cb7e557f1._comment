> I have tried to forbid scripts globally and you know what? The following problems cropped up:

Some (by no means all) websites are written under the assumption that everyone in the entire world has enabled Javascript, and simply refuse to function at all if you have disabled Javascript.  I simply don't visit those websites.

I have found that almost all websites can be browsed even if you disable JavaScript and image loading for security reasons.  They don't look as nice, aren't as easy to use, and things like videos won't work at all (which is a good thing, actually).  But they can still be used.
