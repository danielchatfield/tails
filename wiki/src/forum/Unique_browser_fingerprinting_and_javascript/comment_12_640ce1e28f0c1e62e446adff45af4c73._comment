>\"Forbid scripts globally\" on the NoScript button on the browser!

I've read that the spies can get around that by spoofing a site on NoScript's whitelist and I would imagine it may look different to the spies than a browser with javascript completely disabled. Better to disable it from Iceweasel Edit > Preferences > Content.

NoScript blocks other things and it makes javascript easier to turn on. Some add-ons use javascript. I can't remember if NoScript is one of those.

I don't entirely trust NoScript anyway because I read that they got into an arms race with AdBlock. The NoScript default whitelist used to include google.com! Not sure if it still does because it does not appear on the NoScript whitelist in Tails. Perhaps NoScript gets some of its funding by selling spots on the whitelist? Google certainly functions without javascript and companies like Google are the primary reason I use Tor. Will Google sell the massive database of your mind map to corrupt governments/corporations just to make a buck? If it isn't illegal (everywhere) it ain't evil for Google.
