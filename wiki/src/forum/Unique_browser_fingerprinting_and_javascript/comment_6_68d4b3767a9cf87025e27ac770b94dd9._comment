It's not about determining your location or IP address directly but indirectly.  It's about uniquely fingerprinting your browser configuration.  Web sites accessed through tor could collect these fingerprints.  So could any sites in the clearnet with access to your real identity.    An attacker with access to both datasets then knows who you are.  Duh. This is why users shouldn't use the clearnet browser in Tails if possible.
