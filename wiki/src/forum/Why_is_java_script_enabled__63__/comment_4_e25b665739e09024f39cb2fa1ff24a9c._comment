>Here is a simple javascript (or \"Java Script\") that easily reads your IP: http://javascript.internet.com/user-details/ip-address.html I do not have Tails thumb drive handy at the moment - but I will try to access this url later today via Tails/Tor and see if Torbutton safely handles this particular java script.
