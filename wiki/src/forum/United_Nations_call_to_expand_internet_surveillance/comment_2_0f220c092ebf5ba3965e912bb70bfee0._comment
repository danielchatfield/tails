Can you explain the relevance for Tails users, or at least for Tors users?  (If not, maybe I can try to do so.)

The discussion concerns the possible consequences for Tails users of a current legislative initiative which if enacted into Dutch law would essentially encourage Dutch police agents to break into computers anywhere in the world which some Dutch copper suspects may be breaking Dutch law, and even to alter or destroy data in the compromised computers, apparently with little if any effective input from the Dutch courts, much less international tribunals.

Note that the EFF essay explains the connection with Tor (and thus, with Tails).

Many people feel that more surveillance is the very last thing the world needs.  Others feel that we don't have nearly enough.  I suspect that the former viewpoint better describes the individual views held by most Tails users.
