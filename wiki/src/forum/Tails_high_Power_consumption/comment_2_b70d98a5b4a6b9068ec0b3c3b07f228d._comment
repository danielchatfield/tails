have done that, I think it may be to do with the dual GPU on this model, 4810tgz
Tails chooses the high power ATI gpu which is power hungry, not the low power Intel one. Acer provide switching software in windows, 
I know I cant expect tails to be configured to run my machine just as I want,but is there a way to get tails to choose the low power gpu via terminal ?
