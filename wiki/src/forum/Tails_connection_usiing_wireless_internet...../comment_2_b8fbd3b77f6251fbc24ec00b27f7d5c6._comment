It could be your mouse pad is not fully initialized. Mine isn't. I have to hover over the wireless network and then left click off of the mouse pad. Then it will open that wireless window for me to enter the password for that network (this one I'm using now). For example, I cannot use the mousepad to select text to copy. Anyway, maybe you can play a bit and see if this kind of workaround may help.
