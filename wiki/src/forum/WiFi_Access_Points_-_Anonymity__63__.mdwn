Just a quick question on this. I use Tails on a computer that connects to WiFi from time to time, and Access Points in the area all show up on the available wireless connection points. I know that Google has a database of access points, so is this a potential weak point? Could an attacker trying to get your location find out the names of access points and use that to get a rough location?
