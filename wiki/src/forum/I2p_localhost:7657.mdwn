Hello . I have faced problem with i2p that i can't even add to my address book anything . Also settings of this port are not available and i2p Router Console tell me that my connection is firewalled . Can I fix it , and is it dangerous 4 me to do it ? Also I need my address book persistent is it in var/lib/i2p??
I want FULL i2p as I have Tor thanks for Tails developers .
