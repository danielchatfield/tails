It seems likely that any cryptographic hash algorith contains hidden weakneses.  The question about SHA is whether any are known *only* to their author, the NSA.   It seems that the best answer is that the NSA is more likely to know about any weaknesses known to no other organization than any rival adversary hostile to the best interests of political dissidents.
