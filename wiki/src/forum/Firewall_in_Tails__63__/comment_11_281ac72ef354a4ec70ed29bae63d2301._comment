> Also important (especially if you usually enable a root password, or if you use a persistent Tails) is to ensure your shadow file is well protected. Here Tails could do better by using SHA-512 hashing with a huge number of rounds. Even better if you change to your own huge and unpredictable number of rounds, I think. 

Data point: an attacker who can read `/etc/shadow` is *root*, so
there's little more they can get by guessing your administration
password. So, a better hash function would only help if you
re-use your Tails root password elsewhere.

Tails does not try to protect (yet) anything against an attacker who has gained root privileges.
