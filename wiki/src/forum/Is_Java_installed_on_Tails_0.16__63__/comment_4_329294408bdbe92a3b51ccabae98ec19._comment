>so I'm not sure what you mean by \"disabling\"

Let me provide an analogy.

In Microsoft Windows Vista, 7 or 8, after you click on \"Task Manager\", you will get to see the processes or services that are running at that point in time.

When Tails is running, do the processes or services of Java run in the background? Is there a 'sudo' command to issue to find out the processes and services that are running in the background?
