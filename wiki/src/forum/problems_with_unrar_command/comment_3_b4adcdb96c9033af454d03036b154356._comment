I have to backup comment 2's suggestion of using unar, unar is a command line tool that Tails comes prepackaged with and that does work with password protected rar files.

Also in Debian there are two unrar packages available one marked free and one non-free (Do note that none-free does not mean that you have to pay for the program, it is just a term used to describe the type of licensing and closedness associated with the package). 

The non-free version of the package has no problems with passwords so if you really want to use unrar with password file you should install that.
