I see it's vulnerable.
I wonder though what the text was that I saw in a briefing glance at one particular instance on (ixquick.com on google.com = starpage.com)...
someone must be familiar with that message.
It went somewhere along these lines:

\"Startpage ... offers you... incomplete privacy ...\"

And the message was possibly (?) approx. 700 words long, but it went away in maybe 2 sec.

Anyone to enlighten us more on this issue.

( And, really, the guy who started the thread wasn't neither hostile nor obnoxious nor any, so... peace, pls! )

Anyone who saw that message to tell us more?

I'n not advising against anything, just trying to figure out these things.
