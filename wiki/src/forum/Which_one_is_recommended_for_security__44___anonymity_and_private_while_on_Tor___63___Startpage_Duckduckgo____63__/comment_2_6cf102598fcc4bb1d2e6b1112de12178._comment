Have a look at <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4902> for the discussion that happened for the Tor Browser Bundle. DuckDuckGo is interesting, but the search results quality is not on par with the one given by Startpage.

Please also note that DuckDuckGo is included in the search engine list, and just a click away if you prefer to use it.
