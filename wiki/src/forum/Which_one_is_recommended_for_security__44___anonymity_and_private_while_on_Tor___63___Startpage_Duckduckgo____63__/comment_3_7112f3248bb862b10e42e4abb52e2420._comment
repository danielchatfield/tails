Google makes huge profits from their proprietary search technology and tracking to the maximum extent possible is a major -- if not essential-- part of Google's business model. 

Why would Google make their proprietary, signature search engine available to an outfit like Startpage (Ixquick) or Scroogle (now defunct)?

What's in it for Google?

Is it just a token of sorts; throwing a bone to the privacy-concerned; an illusory gesture; a way for Google to be able to say,

\"See, even though we adhere strict privacy principles....we nonetheless accommodate those who demand even greater privacy...by making our API available to Startpage...\"

???

Remember, rarely, if *ever*, does*anyone* do anything for *purely* selfless, altruistic reasons. There is almost always at least *some* motivation that involves *some* sort of personal gain, on *some* level. This can be as benign as the feeling of self-satisfaction that results from doing something perceived as good. Or as insidious and evil as {fill in the blanks}... or anything in between.
