For anyone who is curious to see what Debian packages apparently use jre (Java Runtime Engine) in a Tails 0.16 system, I believe the standard way to figure this out is to use commands like these (in a root shell):

    apt-cache search jre
    apt-cache showpkg sun-java6-jre
    apt-cache rdepends openjdk-6-jre
