> (Incidentally, because one or two people have asked: *Tor itself isn't affected by the new Lucky-13 attack* against TLS CBC implementations. In order to do plaintext recovery, the attack requires that the same secret be sent in a large number of encrypted TLS sessions. This can happen with HTTPS (where an attacker can force many connections to happen with Javascript, each of which will contain a cookie that the attacker is trying to steal).  Tor, on the other hand, will send the same secret encrypted the same way more than once.

released soon afterwards.

Could this be another reason to consider disabling JavaScript in the browser, as a (temporary?) security measure, in spite of the damage to anonymity?
