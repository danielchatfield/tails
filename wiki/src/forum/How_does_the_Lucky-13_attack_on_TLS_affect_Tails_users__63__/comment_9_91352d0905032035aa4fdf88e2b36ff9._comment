Thank you.

It seems that the Lucky-13 attack may be more practical than earlier thought.  From

> For now, the Lucky Thirteen attacks described in a paper last week by researchers at Royal Holloway, University of London, are largely theoretical. But the potential exists to adapt techniques used in the BEAST attacks against TLS/SSL to improve the feasibility of Lucky Thirteen, a researcher said.

> BEAST, which stands for Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS, is custom javascript exploit code developed by researchers Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong that is injected into a browser session via a malicious iframe or a direct remote injection into a victim’s browser. Attackers can use BEAST to steal cookie data or hijack browser sessions. Researcher Matthew D. Green of Johns Hopkins University said a similar attack could be used to reduce the number of calculations currently required in the Lucky Thirteen attacks to decrypt a session and steal sensitive information.

> “The guys who did the BEAST attack have written javascript like this already; someone would just need to tweak it,” Green said. “They’re most of the way there already.”
