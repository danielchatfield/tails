Too true, alas.

One of the attractive features of i2p is that i2p circuits uses better encryption that Tor circuits.  Also, deeply built into i2p appears to be Java.

Some of us tried for years to raise concerns about the Java runtime engine (jre) which is deeply embedded in the Iceweasel/Tor from Debian stable, on which Tails is based.  However, I think Tails may evade some of the worst problems.
