How the hell are we supposed to know what you are doing when you keep saying different things?

One minute you are not going to change it to start in hidden mode because not allowing others to use your PC as a relay might be less anonymous * Go Figure *

Then your are going to change it to start in Hidden mode because of the ungracefully shutting down of a I2P relay.And we are sitting here fucking dumbfounded to how suddenly the issue of being less anonymous has suddenly vanished.

Then you post things that contradict such as

>I still think the best would be if Tails users could be participating I2P nodes so they won't leech the network.

So it's obvious to us you seem hell bent on finding a way to use us as Data slaves for the I2P network and now your posting again that hidden mode will be implemented.

Maybe if you stopped fucking us about and just actually posted what the final decision is in the thread and the reason why we could discuss it in a technical way for 6 weeks instead of expecting us to be telepathic mind readers as only you know what is definitely happening on the ToDo list and why you are doing it.
