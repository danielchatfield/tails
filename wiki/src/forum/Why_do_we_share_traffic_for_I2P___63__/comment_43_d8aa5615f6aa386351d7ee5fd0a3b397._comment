No one has said I2P starts when you boot Tails?

What is being said is when you click and start I2P from the menu it starts in full server relay mode which means your computer is now acting as a data relay for the I2P network so anybody accessing or hosting illegal content is being passed to your computer which you act as a mask for and you act as the middle man passing the data between them.

Tor doesn't start in server relay mode so I2P shouldn't be doing the same when you start it.
