You might think that the User in comment 244 is being sarcastic but he/she actually makes a good point.

We as users now have to Question the competence of the Tails developers at keeping us secure with correctly configured applications and have to Question the integrity of the project if you are not capable of finding the information needed to change lines of a application configuration file , though Tails seems happy to keep sending users to RTFM when they don't even seem to be capable of doing so themselves.

If the developer of Libert√© Linux is capable and technically competent enough to configure I2P to run in both hidden Mode and via Tor to make sure it can be run from within a Firewall and to make sure users are as anonymous as possible you have to question what the hell is going on with the Tails developers and the project.

Doesn't instill confidence that the Tails project is being run correctly,safe and secure does it? and as somebody else said it's like Tails is using us as a test case and a experiment for the I2P project until someone gets prosecuted as a rely for relaying illegal encrypted traffic like a Tor exit node.
