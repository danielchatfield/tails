Tails users go out of their way not to ever have any contact with the computer running Tor Hidden Onion Page and this is done anonymously by Tor so the Hidden Onion Page never gets Tail users Computer addresses and never makes a direct connection to any Tails users.

A Lot of Tor Hidden Onion pages are running a I2P link.

The Tor Hidden Onion Page running I2P connects to the I2p network Via I2P users.

Some of these I2P users will be Tails Users so the Tor Hidden Onion page has made direct connection between their computers.

How fucking hard to is it comprehend and understand this is a bad idea as you have gone from never existing to Tor Hidden Onion pages to having your computer address logged with them via another protocol.
