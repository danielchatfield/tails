> Will people get their head out of their arse about all this internal encryption of data on the I2P network and node hoping as if there are some secret machines acting as exit nodes on there behalf that hides them.

You raise a common misconception: I2P does not use \"exit nodes\" like Tor, because data *never leaves the I2P network* except from on the actual client and server machines (at which point it is up to the applications to protect; I2P does not protect or anonymize storage of data, just transmission of data. If Alice decides to send Bob her Social Security Number over I2P, there's nothing I2P can do to prevent Bob receiving it - I2P just prevents others knowing that Alice sent it to Bob).

> I2P does not hide or encrypt your IP address

Neither does Tor. Your IP cannot be permanently encrypted; otherwise, how would you ever communicate with other routers/relays? At some level, a packet must be sent from one computer to another.

> and it does not stop you from connecting to computers in the network that are also running external illegal sources so you will be logged to a computer by association of ISP logs.

Making a TCP connection to another computer is not proof that you were deliberately interacting with it - just like with Tor, there is deniability.
