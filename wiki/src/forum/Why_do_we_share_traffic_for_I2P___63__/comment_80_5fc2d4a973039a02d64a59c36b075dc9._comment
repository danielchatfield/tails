From the new paper outling the design of Tor, being published in installments in the Tor blog:

> However, Manils et al. discovered that some Tor users simultaneously ran BitTorrent over the same Tor client as they did web browsing. Running BitTorrent over Tor is a bad idea because the network can't handle the load, and because BitTorrent packets include the user's real IP address in the payload, so it isn't anonymous. But running BitTorrent while doing anonymous web browsing is an especially bad idea. An exit node can find the user's IP address in the BitTorrent payload then trivially de-anonymize all streams sharing the circuit.

> Running BitTorrent over Tor is still strongly discouraged, but this paper did illustrate some potential problems with circuit reuse so proposal 171 was written, and implemented in Tor 0.2.3.3-alpha, to help isolate streams which shouldn't share the same circuit.

BitTorrent is not i2p, but they both belong to the family of p2p sharing sofware packages.  So I think there is something to explain to non-technical Tails users about why using BitTorrent with Tor is a still a bad idea, but using i2p with Tails (and thus with Tor) might be an acceptable risk.
