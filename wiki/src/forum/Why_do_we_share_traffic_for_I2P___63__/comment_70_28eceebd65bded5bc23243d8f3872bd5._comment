\"Your nightmare scenario is more a warning against enabling persistence in Tails rather than against i2p, after all with nowhere to dump illegal material on disk the whole nightmare would be a non-starter.\"

I agree that a computer running from a R/O live DVD with no persistence would probably be harder for script kiddies to attack than a computer running from a USB stick with a persistent volume.  But I don't see why a sophisticated adversary up for a challenge could not possibly mess with a computer running Tails from a USB stick with a persistent volume, which was more or less the situation I had in mind in my scenario.

I agree that the phenomenon (not the prospect, since multiple agencies are by their own admission ALREADY doing this) of cyberagents employed by police or intelligence agencies from multiple countries running around the web breaking into computers and altering or deleting files at will is frightful, but in the early stages is probalby more likely to affect dissidents/activists who use a computer or laptop running off a hard drive installation, possibly unencrypted, possibly not promptly patched with security upgrades, and very likely suffering from some zero day exploits found by sophisticated adversaries.

By the way, this is a topic for another thread, possibly in this forum, but it is not unthinkable for attackers who realize they are attacking a computer running from a live DVD to exploit security vulnerabilities in large buggy programs like the IW/xulrunner suite to alter programs living in RAM.  Not easy but doable.  

I think many people make the mistake of assuming that today's threats look like last year's threats.  But that's not true.  

Remember, once a highly sophisticated adversary has successfully mounted a novel, clever, and un-anticipated attack against some \"worthy\" target, well-funded adversaries can often automate the attack and use it widely.  And don't forget that common sense, and leaked documents from adversaries like \"Team Themis\", suggest that corporate intelligence units (and government intelligence agencies) understand the value of attacking associates of associates of the ultimate target, in order to prepare the way for working closer to their real goal.
