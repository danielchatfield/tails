How is it nonsense when the Law Enforcer knows he is downloading ManLove.AVI and can see the IpAddress of the I2P users sending him the encrypted ManLove.AVI data?

It doesn't matter how many times it has been encrypted or passed around to I2P users if the Law Enforcer is the recipient of the file and the only way it can get to him is via a I2P users and he can see those ipaddresses in his local network map of the connecting computers and what ones passed the data.
