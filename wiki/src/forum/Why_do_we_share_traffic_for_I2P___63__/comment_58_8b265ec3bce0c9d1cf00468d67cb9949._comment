>No, your computer is not being used to 'share and relay illegal porn such as bestiality', it is being used to share encrypted data.

That'll be a yes then. As I'm sure you must be able to comprehend, encrypting \"illegal porn such as bestiality\" doesn't magically turn the plaintext into something benign, it merely cryptographically obfuscates it. This process can be reversed using a process commonly known as *decryption* to reveal that, infact, the \"illegal porn such as bestiality\" did remain \"illegal porn such as bestiality\" all along.

Or do you mean to suggest that there's *no* \"illegal porn such as bestiality\" on the I2P network?
