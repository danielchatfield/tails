Allow me to make user comment 88 slightly clearer for you.

90% of tor hidden-servers now run a I2P link as well.

When you start I2P your computer acts as a relay for all the users that wish to view and visit the I2P sites being hosted on the tor hidden-servers so if you leave I2P running long enough then your computer will connect and have it's IP address logged with every tor hidden-server running I2P regardless if you choose it to or not.

This is a fact that needs to be addressed as it has circumnavigated the use of Tor to hide your IP address from being logged with these hidden-server computers and network hosts.

This is a fact and anybody calling user 88 paranoid or anything else detrimental is just making themselves look like a complete idiot.

fact is not imaginary , paranoia is ...........
