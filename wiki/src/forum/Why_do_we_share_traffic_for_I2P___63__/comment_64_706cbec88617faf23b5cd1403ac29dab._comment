If we share for the Tor network this would happen from when Tails boots. I wouldn't have a problem with this but it gives users more choice if they can choose from the GUI to become a middle or exit node.

Isn't there a way to keep I2P from acting as a router before you allow it to connect to the net? Maybe disconnect from the internet from the taskbar, start I2P, disable sharing?

Boot options for all these things would be nice. Selectable choices would be even more convenient than having to type boot options.
