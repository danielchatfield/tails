If after reading the documentation and learning how it works you don't feel I2P is safe for your use, don't run it. 

If you're stupidly paranoid about people having your IP address (\"OMFG, I2P doesn't hide the fact that I'm using it (and neither does Tor!!!!\"), close your browser and completely disconnect from the Internet because doing *anything* will leave your IP address somewhere.
