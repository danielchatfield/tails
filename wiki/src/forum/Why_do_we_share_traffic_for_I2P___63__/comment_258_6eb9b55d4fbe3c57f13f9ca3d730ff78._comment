I just started a download and i can see the Ip-address and the exact amount of data transfered from the I2P relays in the administration page of my load balancer on my network so where do you get this ridiculous idea that they are not exposed?

If i was a government agency and i downloaded a illegal file i would know exactly who was relaying the data to me. 

So user 254 is correct the relays are not hidden to the downloader and nothing is hiding the last person in the chain that is connecting to me.
