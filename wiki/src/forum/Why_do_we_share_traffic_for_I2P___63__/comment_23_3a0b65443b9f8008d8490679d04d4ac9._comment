> Then why isn't I2P set to start in hidden mode until tails users decide to share their PC with the I2P network?

Because I2P is a peer-to-peer system, it is by its very design made to be a distributed system where every node in the system shares the workload, that's kinda the point of peer-to-peer systems.

> Tor doesn't start in share mode so there is no reason for I2P to do the same.

TOR and I2P are so extremely different from a tech perspective that its silly to even compare them in the way you do, and the reason that TOR's \"sharing mode\" as you call it is not turned on by default is that it is not a default or recommended action and can be quite risky and bothersome for the user.

Also strictly speaking TOR doesn't even have a \"sharing mode\" being a exit node is very, very different from being a sharing node in the I2P network. 

For I2P sharing network load is the default and recommended action, and is not any more risky than not doing it, in fact many would argue that not sharing data while being a part of the I2P network would strongly reduce your security as you are using it in a way it was not designed to work, and opening yourself up to many deannomycation attacks that do not work when I2P is used like it was designed to work.
