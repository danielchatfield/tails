comment 15 - Don't start it? - Change the settings from default?

Considering the OP made this thread about most users being clueless about I2P whether they start it themselfs or start it by mistake clicking around the menus that it starts in server mode and uses your PC to share traffic and data for the I2P network , you truly are a idiot aren't you.
