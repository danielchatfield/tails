> Comment 23 doesn't know what he is talking about (inability to spell “Tor” correctly is a hint). Tor and I2P are quite similar in their design, if one ignores exit nodes. Sharing traffic on I2P is similar to enabling Tor client to be a relay, and same deanonymization attacks apply.

Sorry, I didn't realize that proper casing was such what determined technical knowledge on this topic.

Anyway, you are wrong, Tor (does that make you happy) and I2P are not even based on the same fundamental network type, I2P is a peer-to-peer system which alone makes it fundamentally different from how Tor works. you should have a read at this page over here: http://www.i2p2.de/techintro.html where it is outlined that while it is true that I2P and Tor  share quite a few features from a anonymity perspective they are still fundamentally differences from a design standpoint.
