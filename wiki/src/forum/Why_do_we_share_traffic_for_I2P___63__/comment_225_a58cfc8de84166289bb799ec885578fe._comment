>The I2P users that passes the Encrypted data to the recipient for his PC to decode is acting as a exit node to the I2P network

Yes, some random I2P user X must pass the data directly to the recipient user Y.
However, user X is known as an Inbound Router in such a case; an Inbound Router in I2P is functionally similar to an Entry Guard / Entry Node / Bridge Relay in Tor and they see **encrypted data**. On the other hand, an Exit Node / Exit Relay in Tor is functionally similar to an Outproxy in I2P and they see **unencrypted data**; using an Outproxy is \"outside I2P's (formal) functional scope\" and not an expected use case.

Maybe some textual diagrams for the expected use cases will help you understand.

**Tor->Internet:**

*Tor User Client <-> Entry Guard / Entry Node / Bridge Relay <-> Relay <-> Exit Node / Exit Relay <-> Public Web Server*

**Tor->Hidden Service:**

*Tor User Client <-> Entry Guard / Entry Node / Bridge Relay <-> Relay <-> Rendezvous Point Relay <-> Relay <-> Relay <-> Entry Guard / Entry Node / Bridge Relay <-> Private Tor Server / Public Web Server*

**I2P->eepSite:**

*I2P User -> Outbound Router -> Outbound Endpoint -> Inbound Gateway -> Inbound Router -> Private I2P Server -> Outbound Router -> Outbound Endpoint -> Inbound Gateway -> Inbound Router -> I2P User*


Please cite any precedent for a court finding that a user hosting an Inbound Router of I2P or an Entry Guard / Entry Node / Bridge Relay of Tor is liable for the encrypted traffic that said user cannot decrypt. If such a precedent exists, I imagine that ISPs could be liable for all encrypted traffic that they cannot decrypt as well.
