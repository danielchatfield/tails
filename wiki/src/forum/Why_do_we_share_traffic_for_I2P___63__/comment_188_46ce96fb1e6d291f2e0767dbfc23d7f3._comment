This is truly an amazing find. Here we have a thread filled with treasures of knowledge and intellectual discussions laden with civility. And over here we have a thread packed with countless posts of meaningless, accusatory drivel and pessimistic rantings that would be better suited coming from the mouth of a mentally ill man living in the gutter. Oh wait, it was all the same thread.

I would have stopped reading this garbage long ago if not for a select few whom demonstrated their sanity. Thank you, Tails devs. Thank you, i2p devs.
