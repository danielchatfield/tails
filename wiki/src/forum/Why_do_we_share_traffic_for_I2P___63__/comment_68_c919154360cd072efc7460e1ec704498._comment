@63:

If I were building a botnet I probably wouldn't waste time attacking a
linux system running off a CD in RAM memory which was running on a
relatively slow i2p network when there are millions of vulnerable
Windows systems out there with high-speed broadband connections and
plenty of proven exploits.

Your nightmare scenario is more a warning against enabling persistence
in Tails rather than against i2p, after all with nowhere to dump
illegal material on disk the whole nightmare would be a non-starter.

I agree that it's worrying to have police forces aggressively
targeting computers at home and abroad, but they are just another
adversary to add to the long list that already exists.
