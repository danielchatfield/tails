Good summary!  Thanks.  (I partially disagree with one editorial comment you made, but that hardly matters at this point.)

There is at least one paper at

http://freehaven.net/anonbib/topic.html#Anonymous_20communication

which analyzes i2p, by the way.  Haven't read it yet so don't know if it contains any information relevant to any of the points raised in this thread.
