This discussion is a big fail of intelligence. Too much intelligence. You're still reading. You're one of the guys reading topics with 200+ comments, reading the whole i2p website, debating about it and so on. I am addressing you.

What you think about law enforcement...

- law enforcement has more time than you to learn everything about all networks
- law enforcement is at least equally clever or more clever than you
- when they get a tip that there is a illegal file on i2p or Tor they have experts to handle it
- these experts download i2p or Tor, read the whole i2p or Tor website, read discussions with 200+, anonymously questions to better understand, book consultation from the network makers
- understand the network equally good or better than the network developers
- know the one sending the file to them is not the one possessing the file
- know the one sending the file can not decrypt it

In contrast... What law enforcement does in reality... In this order... It happened similar in the William case.

1.) someone reports a illegal file in clearnet
2.) they are not as motivated as you, they are not geeks like you, they have not so much time like you
3.) they raid and overtake the server
4.) they watch who is downloading illegal files and log ip
5.) they force the provider to user data for ip
6.) they plan a raid
7.) they raid
8.) they eventually understand what Tor is

They keep doing this for a few years. Eventually this causes so many failed cases and so many lost curt rulings that they finally understand what Tor is.

Bureaucrat finally adds what Tor is to the field manual to prevent more financial loss for them. Finally after years all law enforcement understand what Tor is.
