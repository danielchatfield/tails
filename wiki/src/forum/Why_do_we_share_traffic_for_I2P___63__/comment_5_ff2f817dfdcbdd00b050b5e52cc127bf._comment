> Why is I2P set as a server for I2P and shares traffic when Tails is set as client only for the TOR network ?

I2P is designed around the idea that every node should be \"participating\", i.e. relaying other I2P users traffic. After all, it is I2P's default setting to have it enabled. Assuming that very few I2P users deviate from this default, if we'd disable it, it'd make \"non-participating I2P users\" a way to identify Tails users with some probability.

> How is the attention of bringing all that traffic to a PC helping with anonymity. ?

That's irrelevant. I2P makes no real effort to hide the fact that you're using it even if you use the *Hidden mode* (i.e. no participating traffic, and your IP address isn't published in the I2P NetDB). Essentially I2P in Hidden mode is the same as being a Tor client that's not using a bridge. Hence the adversary would just have to keep a list of all participating I2P nodes (trivial) and check whether you're connecting to any of them (trivial in Tails' threat model).

So, until I2P implements something like Tor bridges (they have a proposal for it called \"fully restricted routes\") the Hidden mode is irrelevant w.r.t. attracting attention. If anything it may attract more attention because an adversary may interpret it as suspicious (i.e. clueless users that want to be \"extra anonymous\" activate it).
