Why is Tails trying to mislead people that when running I2P that they are only entry
/middle nodes when the Data has to leave I2P network for the recipient to have the file.

The I2P users that passes the Encrypted data to the recipient for his PC to decode is acting as a exit node to the I2P network and as the others have said this person transferring the Encrypted data to the recipient has his Ipaddress on show as that is the only way he can send data via a network connection to the recipient.

And i'm somewhat shocked and dismayed at Tails attitude \" what person do you know that has been prosecuted \" as that is completely idiotic as what Tor exit node do you know was prosecuted until one was?
