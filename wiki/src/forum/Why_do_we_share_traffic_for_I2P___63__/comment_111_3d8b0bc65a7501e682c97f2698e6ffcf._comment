@ Comment 109: thanks, that helps me understand i2p better!  Maybe you can volunteer to help the Tails project by expanding the i2p documentation?

I like what I've been reading about some of the features of i2p, and I think I am beginning to understand better why i2p may be a better way to offer up legal content which might result in harassment if the author's identity were known.

However, I think the implications of the Opstelten letter are well worth discussing here because it may suggest that the threat model of both Tor and i2p needs to be updated to resist this new state-sponsored threat.
