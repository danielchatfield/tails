I just can't understand why anyone can be against i2p. In this thread people have tried to explain how it works. We have even had an i2p developer here to answer peoples' misgivings and yet still we get uninformed and trenchant comments. I don't think there can be a resolution to this that will satisfy everyone. I think that those who think i2p and tails developers are propagandists with evil intent just need to use some other distro. I mean if you believe they are evil why are you even using their distro?
