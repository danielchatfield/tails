> How do you come to the conclusion that the more people you connect to the more anonymous you become?

well first of all differentiating yourself from 98% of the users of a service is a good way to decrease your anonymity as you sure as heck stand out from the crowd a lot more, and secondly it increases anonymity in the sense that if somebody actually manages to somehow intercept a request from your node and see the data requested then they would be able to tell with  99% certainty that you actually were the one requesting that information, if you were sharing data it would be impossible to tell if you were actually requesting the data or simply forwarding the request from some other peer. 


> I2P starts in server mode which means you are making direct connections to other computers which means you are being recorded at ISPs logs and in some cases this is retained for a year or more.

True, but all of the data sent is encrypted so the fact that the ISP logs the connection is not really all that dangerous for you, especially if you are sending out requests on behalf of others in addition to your own requests.

Also that point is not really relevant to Hidden mode as the exact same thing happens while using I2P with hidden mode enabled.

> The more people you connect to the bigger chance that you will have of making a connection to someone involved in illegal activitys outside of I2P online or in real life and your logged connection to this person now brings attention to you and your ip address if they are under investigation. 

That is theoretically true I suppose, but again this point applies just as much to I2P whith hidden mode enabled as it does with I2P with hidden mode disabled, and I personally find it to be a silly thought that police would really care about what peer-to-peer IP adresses a criminal has connected to, while using Bittorent or I2P you connect to hundreds of IP adresses and the data is pretty much always encrypted so its not like the police would actually have any right to case any of those IP Adresses anyway.

Also is this something that also worries you while using Bittorent? Because again the exact thing applies there.

> This completely contradicts the effort and modification that goes into Tails / Tor of removing your online digital presence and as other have said I2P should not be included in Tails or at least is should start in hidden mode until a person decide they wish to be part of the network and share direct connections to their PC.

No changing something that is on by default and would make you stand out like a sore thumb would be against TAILS policy, though I would actually agree that its a bit strange that TAILS even includes I2P as TAILS is primarily a TOR distro.
