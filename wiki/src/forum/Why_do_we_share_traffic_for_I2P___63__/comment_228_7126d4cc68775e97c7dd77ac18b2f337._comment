You fail at explaining i2p to interested users. This thread is the proof.

Why do you think law enforcement will understand this technical thing?

Don't you know the current William was raided for running a Tor exit node. story? Happened few days ago. Read it. The i2p case is very similar.

i2p is very similar to a Tor exit. Don't kill me for the word similar. Yes, yes, we are not relaying clearnet traffic for others. All is encrypted and only the recipient X knows what they were downloading.

But someone needs to send X the file. Y sends the file. Y is just a normal i2p user. This one could be me.

In Williams case law enforcement just just saw his IP was sending the illegal file. They raided him. They didn't bother learning the network details.

What happens if law enforcement downloads a illegal file from i2p? The one sending the file to X could be me and then I could get raided because law enforcement tends to have poor understanding for the networks.

Being an i2p user is like participating an experiment. Very risky.
