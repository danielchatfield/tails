There is something the Tails team has not told you all.

A vast majority of Tor sites running a hidden Onion service are now also running a I2P connection from that Tor computer.This means you have made a direct connection using I2P and your ipaddress has been logged in association with that computer should it be raided and taken down , so hiding behind Tor was pointless.

The Tails team have really screwed up on this one.
