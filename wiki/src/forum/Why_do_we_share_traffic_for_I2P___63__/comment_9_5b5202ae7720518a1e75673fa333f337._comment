No

The op is saying when you start I2P it starts in server mode and uses your PC to share data for the I2P network and most people are clueless about this as most people assume Tails is set for everything to be read only and not share anything from your PC.

So it goes against what everything else tails is about as you have no control what your PC is bring used to share on the I2P network and i have to agree it shouldn't be part of Tails.
