> And I will answer with yet another technical point: the data you relay for others are stored encrypted in RAM and you don't have the key...due to perfect forward secrecy. All this also applies to Tor relays.

This is very good to know; thanks!

> To date, though, I haven't heard of a single Tor non-exit relay (or participating I2P node) that has been raided. 

I have, but yes, so far this seems to be rare.  And I agree that the bigger LE agencies these days seem to be generally better informed about Tor.  The intellectual property trolls, not so much.  Harrassment can come in many forms.

> Just like the middle nodes the Exit nodes should ideally be picked as randomly as possible for maximum anonymity. In Tor the randomness is skewed by the node's capacity (more capacity -> more likelihood to be picked), but without that property the Tor network would function really poorly performance-wise, which probably would result in lower anonymity when all factors are taken into account.

Good point; thank you.

> There are end-to-end timing correlation attacks that only require observing at the traffic you send to the Tor Entry, and the traffic the Tor Exit sends to the destination ... adding more nodes makes attacks that depend on misbehaving/snooping middle nodes more efficient.

Good stuff.  I don't entirely understand that last bit, but your taking the time to explain some of these points should help to convince any doubters of the validity of my statements that (i) anonymity/privacy is really hard to obtain (ii) Tails and Tor developers are aware of many non-obvious pitfalls, have found reasonably good solutions to some of them, and are working on mitigating others.

> relays could just add random delays which would save significant bandwidth for the network.

This is seeming like a better and better idea every day, so I hope the Tors developers find a way to implement it.  If I understand what you are saying, small delays won't help nearly as much as I hoped.

> to defend against global adversaries anonymity networks need more users that can generate activity and more relays to make that possible.

Absolutely, one of the nicest things about TBB and Tails is that they make it easy for nontechnical people to quietly run a relay.  I appreciate a point made at the Tor website, that this can help anonymize your own Tor traffic.  The \"foreign\" traffic is certainly not \"random\" but it is at least somewhat arbitrary, which might be helpful.

> Such tools would only work if the Tor binary you use has been compromised, which could happen if you didn't authenticate Tor when you downloaded it. In that case the automatic tools could swap the Tor binary you think you are downloading with one that enables them to MitM you. MitM:ing a Tor client running an uncompromised Tor binary (and system in general) shouldn't be possible as long as the crypto holds, which we reasonably can assume it does.

Good to know.  Although I was quite worried by the Comodo hacker's exploit in obtaining a genuine (but improperly issued) certificate which, but for a minor error, would apparently have allowed him to impersonate the Mozilla add-ons sites, and thus possibly to insert malware into a fake update for NoScript which potentially might have caused a serious problem for Tor users.  And there have been several reliable reports of intrusions into major linux servers.  I think it would be hard for an intruder to mess with the kernel and not be caught, but I worry about an intruder messing with debs or rpms and not getting caught before many people download the bad \"update\".

I wonder whether you are aware of specific claims by specific vendors of state-sponsored-malware that they have the ability to insert trojans into an update as it traverses the wires from a vendor to a user.  I can see why this would seem intrinsically dubious, but when I have time I might try to explain what I think they might mean.

> There is not even a difficult solution to this issue that doesn't have extreme drawbacks that would kill the network.

I think I take your points regarding delays, etc. but I also think this means that instead of giving up (that's unthinkable while we yet live), we need to think out of the box.

Perhaps workable solutions lie in realizing that while global adversaries make capable and fearsome opponents, we also have certain intrinsic advantages, while our global adversaries have some intrinsic limitations.  In some ways I think that broadening the scope of design goals to take account of net infrastructure conditions and sociopolitical conditions can offer opportunities for privacy-enhancing software developers.

The Tor Talk post you linked to is fascinating---thanks so much!  As you probably realize, it tends to validate my contention that despite the vast wealth squandered on a certain global adversary, not everything is going their way.

> Running I2P in addition to the more typical applications should be fine with 1 GiB of RAM. For instance, I have an I2P instance which I've been running with participatory traffic for years (so it's massively well-connected and constantly saturates its participatory pipes) and it uses ~160 MiB of RAM, give or take. In Tails I rarely see that number climb much higher than ~70 MiB.

Very good to know, and an excellent candidate for quick addition to the existing i2p documentation at this website.

I'm learning a lot from this thread and I thank you again for your excellent and informative responses!

While I have your ear, off the top of my head some suggestions for additions to the existing Tails documentation:

[*] a tutorial on using remixers to anonymously email submitted documention to Tails, encrypted of course.
[*] if such a thing is even possible, how to configure a thin client to run a tor relay, preferably off fire-and-forget read-only media, written for Windows/Mac/Linux users who hardly know what a thin client is but happen to have one lying around,
* a tutorial on GPG covering the importance of protecting the keyring
* a tutorial on information theory with applications to re-identification, fingerprinting, authorship attribution
* a tutorial on Bayesian reasoning with applications to the kind of analysis in the Tor Talk post you cited
* a discussion of some of the surveillance methods Tails users are likely to encounter

Some of these I fancy I could help with.

Doesn't fit in with Tails, but I'd like to a tutorial on secure apt.
