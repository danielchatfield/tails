>Aren't they using the 2-hop tunnels when they do this, though?

Only if you use Tor.

But as the user pointed out most of the Hidden Servers are now running a dual link with a IP2 connection to their hidden server machine as well.

So as you are acting as relay server when you are running I2P you will at some point make a direct connection to all the computer addresses running a hidden server through the I2P connection when another I2P user requests to look at their site and the relays connect and fetch the data on their behalf.

It's a total fuckup.
