> Comment 23 has put it more clearly than I could.

Comment 23 doesn't know what he is talking about (inability to spell “Tor” correctly is a hint). Tor and I2P are quite similar in their design, if one ignores exit nodes. Sharing traffic on I2P is similar to enabling Tor client to be a relay, and same deanonymization attacks apply.
