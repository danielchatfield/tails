> (...) The differences (yes, I read that page you linked to a long time ago) are purely technical (..)

let me quote myself from earlier:

> TOR and I2P are so extremely different from a tech perspective (...)

It shouldn't be to hard to figure out that by \"tech perspective\" I was in fact referring to the fact that they were fundamentally different from a technical standpoint which you just admitted they are. 

> Operation of Tor and I2P is still very similar, and same deanonymization attacks apply.

I'd like to see you point out exactly how the operation of a Peer-to-Peer system like I2P and Tor are very similar, and while its true that both of the networks suffer from some of the same deanonymization attacks they most certainly aren't so similar that they suffer from exactly the same deanonymization attacks, some problems only affect Tor, and vice versa, which isn't surprising considering how again there are fundamental differences in their design.


> Now, since you are clearly over your capacity in comprehending even a simple introductory summary page, please save this and other threads from your incompetence.

says the guy who couldn't even comprehend my original statement and apparently judges peoples knowledge based on correctly cased abbreviations, also telling people who you are arguing against to not reply to you is generally considered pretty bad form.
