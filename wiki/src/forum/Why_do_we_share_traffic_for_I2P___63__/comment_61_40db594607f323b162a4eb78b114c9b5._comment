I don't think that it's scorn so much as hysteria. Those that argue against
complete privacy and anonymity on the net usually play on the fear that if we
had complete anonymity it would give free rein to pedophiles, terrorists and
copyright infringers. The individual who is spamming this thread with
increasingly hysterical abuse is evidently duped by those negative arguments
and has a very dark view of human nature.

There is another interesting thread on this board where a script kiddie from
zoklet.net set up a tor exit node to sniff the traffic. He was dissapointed to
find how ordinary and mundane the traffic was. I would guess that a test of i2p
traffic would show it to be just as tame.
