Reading the comments, seems like if someone was technical enough to install i2p and configure their browser to use it, they would be technical enough to go to a simple config panel to put in hidden mode if they so desired.

It's simple, I2P simply allows you to route other peoples data so when you decide to use I2P your data is buried within all the other data being routed, which is just one of the features if I2P. Turning off the server function makes it to where someone can very easily record your encrypted data and start trying to decrypt it. Encryption is the other feature.

Being a server = burying your data in routed data, making it harder to separate and log your encrypted data

Not being a server = your data is still encrypted, but since you're not routing other data it isn't hidden in their data, making it very easy for logging. It just isn't as secure.
