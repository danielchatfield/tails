How fucking hard to is it understand and comprehend that with Tails Tor you decide what your computer shares and what content you look at but with Tails I2P you have no choice what it shares on behalf of others and what they are using your computer to look at.?

This isn't like bittorent where you only share the file you are downloading.

I2P you share everything for everybody just by starting it.
