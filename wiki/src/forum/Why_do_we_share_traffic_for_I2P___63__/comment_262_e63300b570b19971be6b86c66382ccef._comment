I think there has been confusion throughout this entire thread by most users to what part of the link is being discussed. :)

But I'm glad Tails has finally caught on and now acknowledged that Tails I2P users are having their IP addresses exposed to down loaders and can now hopefully understand why most people looking for anonymity would find that objectionable until they decide for themselves to share it.

Otherwise this thread could go on for another 260 odd posts. :D
