> Am I reading this correctly? So each time I boot into Tails, I2p is running even if the user never launches the program themselves?

Incorrect. I2P has to be started manually.

> The op is saying when you start I2P it starts in server mode and uses your PC to share data for the I2P network and most people are clueless about this as most people assume Tails is set for everything to be read only and not share anything from your PC.

What does \"read only\" have to do with it? About \"sharing\": at worst you \"share\" some bandwidth and a few spare CPU cycles when participating in the I2P network. I fail to see enough harm in this to disable it to the detriment of the I2P networks's peer-to-peer nature. Besides, the participating traffic may help you some what to resist certain types of deanonymization attacks, which would be a shame to lose.

> So it goes against what everything else tails is about

I believe you are mistaken. Tails' [[contribute/design]] does not prohibit participating in peer-to-peer networks like I2P. 

> you have no control what your PC is bring used to share on the I2P network

You have all the controls needed to make I2P non-participating. Go to the I2P Network Configuration page via the I2P Router console (the page that is automatically opened when I2P starts) and select *Hidden mode*.

> i have to agree it shouldn't be part of Tails.

If you still feel this is the case, please provide clear (preferably technical) arguments if you want us to reconsider this.
