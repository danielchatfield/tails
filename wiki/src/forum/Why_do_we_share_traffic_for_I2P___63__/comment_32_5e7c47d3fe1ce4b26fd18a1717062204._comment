> I'd like to see you point out exactly how the operation of a Peer-to-Peer system like I2P and Tor are very similar, and while its true that both of the networks suffer from some of the same deanonymization attacks they most certainly aren't so similar that they suffer from exactly the same deanonymization attacks

How is P2P architecture even relevant to the subject of the thread? You are just parroting terms with zero understanding. Do you think it's not obvious that all your descriptions are extremely generic and do not stem from actual knowledge? I am completely, 100% sure that you can't describe even one deanonymization attack. This is not high school, you need to know what you are talking about to be useful.
