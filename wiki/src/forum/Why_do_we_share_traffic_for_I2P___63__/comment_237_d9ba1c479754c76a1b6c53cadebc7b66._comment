I understand the whole thing may be confusing, but I don't
believe I was expecting any kind of telepathic skills in my
previous comment.

I believe we did exactly what you are asking for in comment #110 (Thu 25 Oct 2012 04:53:37 AM CEST), and further clarified it in the one titled *The Tails vs. I2P FAQ :)* (Thu 25 Oct 2012 06:55:23 PM CEST).

Comment #110 points to the [[TODO item|todo/i2p_hidden_mode]] I was
referring to. I'm sorry it's hard to find this post when a dozen
dozens of other comments are added bellow it.

This specific topic put aside, I don't know many Free Software
projects that are as public as Tails about why and how they do
things. Any idea how we could improve this further, so that you
don't get the impression we are the only ones who know what's
happening with our TODO list?

To end with, this forum is *not* advertised to be a suitable
place to discuss such matters, and I think this thread
practically demonstrates why.
