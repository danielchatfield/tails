@ str4d:

Thank you very much for taking the time to read (skim?) the thread and to respond.  While the documention at the i2p website is very good, the design principles are (I guess) inherently confusing for the average user, so you shouldn't be dismayed that some of us are still struggling to grasp the technical points.  Your post did help me better understand how i2p differs from bittorrent.

> However, there are countries which would be happy enough to just block any I2P user regardless of what they might be doing (though to my knowledge there have been no such blocks), and so for users in those countries (or more wary users elsewhere) \"hidden mode\" disables publishing of the router's IP:port in the network database

What about the Opstelten letter?  Doesn't that seem to raise the possibility that assuming your work is good and the Dutch authorities cannot easily penetrate the garlic encryption to determine whether they think the content is illegal under Dutch law, they will simply use their state-sponsored malware to try to crash all the computers participating in i2p?

> So, what would be best for Tails users? The feeling I get from the above thread is that the standard use case for Tails is to boot it up off a CD or read-only USB, use it for anywhere between a few hours and a day, and then shut it down.

True for me, so add one data point to your categorical data.

> So, to sum up: enabling or disabling \"hidden mode\" is a swings-and-roundabouts kind of choice. Disabling it will blend the router in with the rest of the network, while enabling it will make the router harder to find initially.

Tradeoffs, yeah.

> Making a TCP connection to another computer is not proof that you were deliberately interacting with it - just like with Tor, there is deniability.

Point taken, but I fear that i2p and Tails developers may be missing an absolutely critical point about privacy-enhancing software: developers cannot be expected to be both programmers and lawyers, yet it is absolutely essential that they attempt to be aware of how laws are applied around the world, in both \"repressive\" and \"democratic\" regimes.  (Everyone has his own opinion about where Russia, or example, fits in this classification, so its better to treat all government LE/intell/military agencies as potential adversary organizations.)

I trust you will agree that coppers, judges, and juries all tend to very ignorant of technical fine points, and should any i2p user be arrested, perhaps on suspicion of violating Thailands laws against defaming the King, it is quite possible, even likely, that he/she will not be able to present expert witness testimony explaining the point you just made.

In several high profile trials in the past few years, things generally have not go well for defendants whom a government wished to convict when they have attempted to argue that no evidence has been presented at suggesting that they had malintent, or even (for technical reasons) they they could have had knowledge.

Overall, I find the i2p design increasingly intriguing, but I have to say that my impression is that, for a combination of political and technical reasons, simply participating in i2p may be more dangerous that simply using Tor, and I still do not see how it would be safe to use from the same domain where one uses Tor.  

But this is all quite fascinating and I hope you will try again to convince the sceptics.

@ tails:

Thanks for taking the time to read (skim) the thread and for your long comment.

> You need to start I2P for it to make any difference. The difference it makes is that an adversary that can observe your traffic (e.g. you ISP) can see that you are using both Tor and I2P in parallel. If that is an uncommon combination it could serve as a way to identify Tails users that start I2P, but I suspect it is common enough to make such a classifier very inefficient.

Thanks.

> This is very unlikely, and it should be pointed out that Tor is no better in this respect (in fact I2P uses much stronger crypto than Tor currently does).

The first is somewhat reassuring, and I agree with the second point.

> Doing cover traffic right is hard, and what you suggest isn't good enough. For it to do anything it has to be a constant cover flow, and even then it's arguable how efficient it is.

Agree to both.  Random delays to thwart timing attacks might be more effective for now.

> I2P doesn't cache any traffic it relays, so that encrypted data only lives in RAM.

THANK YOU!  Very important point and good to know.

Of course, if someone is running i2p at home, leaves home, comes back to find authorities carting off his/her computer (still running), even the strong i2p encryption is vulnerable since it turns out that if you can image the RAM of a running computer, AES keys, Serpent keys, blowfish keys, TrueCrypt, etc., are easy to search for and this can enable an attacker to decrypt data.   In favorable circumstances.  So at least claim some tutorials published in journals for computer forensics people.  

This scenario assumes, I think, that something has gone wrong with garlic or onion or that sufficiently many machines have been seized and had their RAM imaged while still running that all the needed keys are available.  To save you the trouble, I think I agree that this would have to be one well-timed and massive raid.

(Maybe classic cryptographic blunders could play a role in discussion of how things might go wrong with Tor or i2p.  Using \"Preview\" on a long post probably exposes me to some general attacks while using this forum, which I hope would be impractical.)

So going back to the political point, it seems possible that some governments might decide to mount some massive raid seizing as many computers using i2p as possible, and upon possing finding illegal content in some poor schlub's RAM, might very possibly win a conviction even though (as was clearly explained by the i2p developer), the schlub didn't know nuthin and for technical reasons couldn't have known nuthin about that content.  The garlic encryption might seem to prevent this from being possible, but I still worried and I think this requires more study.

> When you use Tor every eavesdropper between you and the Tor network will know it, and that includes you ISP, government, NSA, ECHELON etc. In other words real adversaries will still see that your IP address connects to the Tor network.

Agreed.

Let me try to summarize some basic points in my own words (and
please correct me if I am wrong on any point):

* By default Tor circuits consist of at least four hops: me via intermediate servers such as my ISP gateway to an Entry Guard, EG to relay, relay to Exit Node, Exit Node to destination

* Tor uses serial encryption to prevent the operator of Entry and relay notes from reading the content of traffic (UNLESS they are cooperating with operator of Exit Node)

* Thus, the Entry Guard operator can log my IP address and can log encrypted packets sent by my Tor client, but should find it difficult to read the content of the encrypted packets

* The Exit Node operator can read content if the destination site does not use https, for example user/password combinations if I use Tor while logging into a webforum account, but should find it difficult to deduce who downloaded/uploaded that content

* If the destination site uses https, for example a typical webmail server, the Exit Node operator would find it difficult to read user/password combination or to read content of downloaded/uploaded emails

* The DNS lookups neccessary to translate the destination url into a IP are done by the Exit server, thus making it difficult for adversaries to deduce what content I am accessing

* When accessing via Tor a website which uses https, an OCSP lookup must be made to verify the website certificate, and this is done by the Exit node

* When the Exit node gets a webpage from the destination webserver, depending upon settings of my browser and other factors, a dozen other servers run by third parties might be contacted following the instructions in php scripts (etc) on the webserver, so many parties will have some clues that someone, with a certain browser profile even, downloaded a certain page at a certain time

* Each Tor client should a small stable set of Entry guards in order to reduce the chance of successful deanonymization attacks

* Each Tor session should use as many Exit Nodes as possible, particularly when surfing to a new domain destination

* More than 3 hops make safer Tor circuits, but this would slow down websurfing using Tor and could even overload the Tor network

* Widely deployed automatic tools can be used to try to evade the encryption of Tor traffic, possibly via MITM attacks mounted between me and my ISP, between my ISP and the Entry Node, or between the Exit Node and the destination server

* If my computer has been compromised, Tor cannot protect me; for example, if I stored plaintext copies of emails those could be read by an intruder; if I failed to protect my GPG keyring, they could be read by an alert intruder even if I kept only encrypted copies of emails.

> The short tl;dr is: I2P is safe in Tails' threat model, with or without \"hidden mode\".

But I think a key point is that both the Tails and i2p threat model need to be regularly reassessed and possibly updated.  I think the rapidly increasing likelihood of full-scale all-against-all global cyberwar, massive scale automated state-sponsored malware attacks (quite possibly targeting very Tor user and i2p user whose \"likely\" IP address can be found, and collateral damage be damned), as per the Opstelten letter, suggests that the Tor and i2p threat model needs to be re-examined.  In particular, the disclaimer in the Tor threat model about \"not defending against global adversaries\" must be dropped, however daunting the goal of defending against multiple global adversaries must seem.  I like the fact that the i2p threat model does attempt some defense against global adversaries, but my impression is that it still needs revision to take account of state-sponsored malware and cyberwar campaigns extending to data destruction and quite possibly (when that fails) physical destruction of partipants in the i2p network.

Again, this is all quite fascinating and I thank you both for taking the time to try to wade through some long posts and try to share what you know.  Most of us are not programmers and it may take some patience before we adequately grasp the most salient technical points.

@ str4d:

Silly question maybe, but for those of use who for political reasons are frightened by the possibility of \"guilt by association\" when using i2p, or who want to minimize the chance of seeing something they'd rather not see, do you have any .i2p sites which you are confident would not be likely to draw the ire of law enforcment in most jurisdictions?  Like the example of an onion site quoted above which republishes Thomas Paine's essay \"Common Sense\".  I am starting to feel we owe it to you to at least try i2p since you have taken so much time to try to explain some difficult points to us!
