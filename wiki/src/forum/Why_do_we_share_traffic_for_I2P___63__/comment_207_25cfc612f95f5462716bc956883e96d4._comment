> I'm sure that you are just spreading FUD, but I don't understand your motivation. What do you gain from undermining the i2p project?

It is known (search for news articles about \"Team Themis\", for example) that corporations and the governments they more or less own engage in \"disruption\" campaigns against perceived adversaries by attempting to sow mutual distrust and by spreading disinformation in forums like this one.   \"Sting\" operations are also common.  (The aclu.org website offers many documents obtained from US police agencies under FOIA concerning dozens of infiltration operations targeting US political organizations which illustrate some common practices.) 

But just plain trolling is also common.  So how to know what a \"strange\" forum post or sequence of posts represents?  You can't know.  But reacting irrationally is probably the worst thing you can do.

Anyone concerned about the possibility of disruption campaigns or sting operations should search for \"security culture for activists\" material at sites like riseup.net.  Advice offered from experienced activists is basically to take common sense precautions, but also to not let a sense of being watched (not misplaced because activists everywhere are being watched) paralyze you into inaction.  

(Riseup is the international activist collective which provides the server which provides this forum.  You might have heard that the FBI seized a server in NY which was operated by an allied collective, but that didn't affect this forum.  That was another server in another location.  And I hope I it is acceptable to mention that Riseup is currently raising funds to continue providing services.)

Also bear in mind that simply using Tor at all may be viewed by authorities in your location as a political act.  And remember that US agencies like the CIA and DHS have admitted that they monitor forums like this one.

But there is another possibility.  I think it is quite possible that the supposed \"troll spreading FUD\" is sincerely worried, and at times seems a bit irrational because he is being personally harrassed by the Untouchables.  Don't forget that trying to intimidate a \"target\" to the point where he/she behaves irrationally is a venerable tactic employed by all police agencies, as is trying to portray government authorities as all-knowing and all-powerful.  As the saying goes, \"Police work is 90% bluff\".  They have lots of experience bluffing and frightening and lying to people, so they have gotten pretty good at it.

Also, remember that it is true (and well known) that intelligence agencies routinely engage in deceptive and manipulative actions targeting dissidents, so the suggestion that a project presented to the world as \"pro-privacy software\" is actually something different is not itself insane or even inappropriate.  

I myself doubt that Tails (or Tor) is something other than what it seems, but we do know that Tor has been used by curious researchers as an intelligence collection program using rogue exit nodes, so simply shouting down expressions of concern is in my opinion more injurious to the Tails project than providing links to good information and relevant discussions.

Anyone willing to entertain the possibility that someone is genuinely worried should answer with clear explanation and links instead of derision.  Anyone who is not, should just ignore any posts they consider to be \"trolling\" (a term which is often misused in internet forums).  In my opinion, only the posts mocking the alleged troll are unmistakably trolling posts (because they are intended to get in the way of the forum's mission, to discuss Tails-related issues).

As a general comment, I sense that some users at forums like this one feel very strongly that software like Tails should be discussed without any reference to politics and civil rights issues.   I sympathize with that viewpoint, and even held it myself, but as I've gained experience and knowledge I've come to see that this attitude is inappropriate, even absurd, in user forums for privacy-enhancing tools like Tails.  Such software does not exist in a political vacuum, and IMO developers are a disservice to the user community, and even endangering the user community, if they do not allow discussion of political context.  Political discussions do tend to be inflammatory, but in the context of Tails issues I think they are unavoidable.

So, coming back to the positive: this thread inspired me (and apparently others also) to read the i2p documentation, which is certainly intriguing.  I'd like to hear more from the i2p developer about some useful projects.  For example, I have information I'd like to share with anyone interested in topics which have come up on this forum.  So I'd like to hear from i2p users who have used i2p successfully to share information with other activists.
