This is the Tails forum.  Tails \"bundles\" Tor with some other things as a \"live DVD Linux distro\" (closely based on Debian stable) in order to help citizens, including non-technical people, to use privacy-enhancing tools.  The developers would be remiss if they did not try to ensure that potential users of Tails understand as clearly as possible the potential risks of using Tails.  This requires understanding some technical aspects of how Tor operates, but also requires awareness of current attacks by capable adversaries, and this in turn requires some knowledge of current legal issues surrounding attacks by sophisticated software made by various companies on Tor, the tool which drives Tails.

Everything the Tails developers (and the Tor developers) do should (and apparently is) informed by a threat model, and it seems legitimate to discuss whether the existing threat model needs to be updated to try to mitigate new threats which might directly affect a majority of Tor users (or i2p users), and thus, potentially directly affect the average Tails user.

This thread is a discussion of the possible dangers of bundling (or at least, enabling) i2p sharing while using Tails (and thus, while using Tor and Torbutton).  Many users have commented, and some quite intelligent, well-informed, and thought provoking comments have been made.  The only unhelpful comments I have seen have been comments like the last two which apparently seek to shout down a legitimate discussion of a potential safety issues in using Tails.

The recent initiative by the Dutch government appears to be aimed directly at Tor users, and thus, at Tails users.  This not a singular opinon; respected news organizations such as The Wall Street Journal, The Register, and respected advocacy groups like the EFF and ACLU have in the past few days explicitly made the connection between Tor and the Dutch initiative.  This is clearly a major development which directly affects the Tor threat model (and thus, the design goals of future versions of Tails).

If the forum powers permit, I would like to try to explain how certain technical measures which have been commonly deployed for years can compromise the privacy of thousands of Tor users, and also (by slightly different failure modes) thousands of p2p users, who are not suspected by authorities of involvement in anything criminal or even objectionable, but whose privacy is intruding upon by authorities searching for a suspected pirate, criminal, etc.

(The two media organizations I mentioned tend towards opposite extremes of mainstream international political expression, but the reporting of WSJ and Bloomberg on the troubling issues of potentially illegal electronic activity by police or private organizations in the name of investigating/thwarting suspected \"crimes\" or \"piracy\" has been excellent, which is surprising but laudable because the surveillance industry is so lucrative for corporations like Harris, maker of the Stingray IMSI capture devices whose legality is currently being litigated in US courts, and also, how ironic, Dutch courts, in connection with someone accussed of obtaining such devices and using them to intercept the contents of cell phone conversations, in order to blackmail the data breach victims.)

The links above should help anyone to quickly get up to speed on the significance for Tor users and p2p users (and thus, of Tails users) of the Dutch initiative.  In my opinion everyone who uses Tor or p2p (and thus, all Tails users) should regard this as mandatory reading relevant to updating the existing Tails documentation warning of possible dangers of using Tails.

Another point readers should bear in mind is that the authorities (in the Americas, Europe, most Asian and increasingly many African nations) already use IMSI capture and remote intrusion techniques with rapidly growing frequency, knowing full well that this violates the privacy of citizens, the vast majority of whom are not suspected by the governments of \"doing anything wrong\".  Unfortunately these authorities seem to have decided that it is in the national security interest to prevent the public from learning anything about how these techniques work and what they can and cannot do (to Tor and i2p users specifically).  That is why I am so proud of reporters at WSJ, Bloomberg, NYT, Washington Post, The Guardian, etc., for having the courage to write stories presenting much information which is invaluable for understanding how these techniques, however \"well intentioned\", impact all citizens who use a browser or a phone or just about any other electronic device (even if not connected to \"the web\"),
