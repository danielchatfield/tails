I does not even need to be anything fancy such as a network load balancer as i can see what I2P users are connected to me and who is transferring data in the connection tab of my cheap $60 router.But i am sure Tails and user 254 will just try and carry on with the Blatant Lies and misleading fake terminology and claim that our routers are not really physically connected to our PCs but really out there some place in the middle of the internet hidden with encryption.

One thing that is for sure relays have no protection to the downloader as i know what i just used their PCs for to download even if they ignorant of what they are relaying.
