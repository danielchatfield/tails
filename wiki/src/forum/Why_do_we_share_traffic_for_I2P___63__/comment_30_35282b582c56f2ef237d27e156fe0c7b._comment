> Sorry, I didn't realize that proper casing was such what determined technical knowledge on this topic.

It just means that you don't know anything about Tor, since it's easy to spot by the wrong spelling. I don't care about the spelling myself.

> Anyway, you are wrong, Tor (does that make you happy) and I2P are not even based on the same fundamental network type, I2P is a peer-to-peer system which alone makes it fundamentally different from how Tor works.

Again, you don't know what you are talking about. The differences (yes, I read that page you linked to a long time ago) are purely technical, and relate to how the system is bootstrapped, how tunnels are constructed, and how packets are routed.

Operation of Tor and I2P is still very similar, and same deanonymization attacks apply.

Now, since you are clearly over your capacity in comprehending even a simple introductory summary page, please save this and other threads from your incompetence.
