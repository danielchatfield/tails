>@str4d You are ignoring the anonymity aspects of not enabling hidden mode.

I probably ignored quite a bit, because I could tell that the comment was no longer a comment ^_^

> Does a user connecting to an eepSite transmit a timestamp to that eepSite? If true, one can compare the timestamp to that of known routers. 

No - the HTTP tunnels have hard-coded filtering to remove and anonymize HTTP headers. Timestamps are removed, as are several other headers. The Browser identity header is modified rather than removed (to \"MYOB 6/66 ANoN\" or something similar).

Tor, however, does not do this - in fact, the attack you describe was tested recently, and successfully, on numerous .onion sites, by comparing clock skew of known Tor relays to the header info (he called it \"clockskewering\" ^_^).
