How do you come to the conclusion that the more people you connect to the more anonymous you become?

I2P starts in server mode which means you are making direct connections to other computers which means you are being recorded at ISPs logs and in some cases this is retained for a year or more.

The more people you connect to the bigger chance that you will have of making a connection to someone involved in illegal activitys outside of I2P online or in real life and your logged connection to this person now brings attention to you and your ip address if they are under investigation.

This completely contradicts the effort and modification that goes into Tails / Tor of removing your online digital presence and as other have said I2P should not be included in Tails or at least is should start in hidden mode until a person decide they wish to be part of the network and share direct connections to their PC.
