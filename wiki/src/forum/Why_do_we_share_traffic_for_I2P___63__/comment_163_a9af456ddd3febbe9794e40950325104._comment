How much RAM should you have to use i2p?  I saw in the Tails documentation that you should have at least 1 GB of RAM, but should Tails users who want to explore i2p have more?  This could be a problem for some of us.

The point was of course that quite the opposite, that if your webforum username can be tied to your IRL identity, you outed yourself.

The thread is long in part because anonymity is a really hard problem, which is not made easier by the fact that everyone who needs anonymity also needs security, and these can be conflicting goals.
