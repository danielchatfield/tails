Will people get their head out of their arse about all this internal encryption of data on the I2P network and node hoping as if there are some secret machines acting as exit nodes on there behalf that hides them.

I2P does not hide or encrypt your IP address and it does not stop you from connecting to computers in the network that are also running external illegal sources so you will be logged to a computer by association of ISP logs.

Example

A computer is running I2P , a hidden-tor server and a webpage.

this computer get taken down through a raid.

Every computer on the I2P network that has connected to it will show in the ISP logs as passing traffic for that computer regardless if the content is encrypted.

Get a grip , I2P is not anonymous and it is definitely not a Amnesic Incognito live system and it will not stop a warrant being put on your Ip address.
