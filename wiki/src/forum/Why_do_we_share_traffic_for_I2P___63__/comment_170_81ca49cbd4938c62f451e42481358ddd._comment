Why are some Tails users so anxious to minimize the exposure of their IP address?

Because we fear that within six months to a year, even though Tor and i2p have not been specifically outlawed, a large fraction of Tor and i2p users may be regularly targeted for illicit intrusion and data destruction by foreign cybercops acting on a global scale.  And if remotely erasing files doesn't \"work\", the cybercops may well attempt to remotely erase enough of the hard drive to render targeted computers unbootable.  Or to employ even more sophisticated state-sponsored malware to otherwise brick computers being run off USB sticks or DVDs.

If enacted into Dutch law, Opstelten's proposal won't solve any problems for the Dutch authorities.  Instead, by the all-too-familiar process of \"mission creep\", the authorities will respond to the failure of their initial efforts by incrementally increasing the scale and scope of their global cyberoperations.

An analogy might help.  Imagine that the authorities in the Republic of Yuk decide that some border crossing is being used to smuggle dissident literature into Yuk.  Not wanting to admit that their regime is so shaky that they regard political dissidents as an existential threat, they loudly complain about a supposed influx of offensive porn through that crossing.  This problem is, they claim, so serious that Yuki policemen have been authorized to shoot out the tires of cars attempting to drive into Yuk. This policy effectively closes the border, even though cars and driving have not been outlawed in either country.  But the Yuki authorities find that political unrest inside Yuk continues to increase, and conclude that dissident literature is still being smuggled across their borders.  Frustrated, they instruct their secret agents to start \"disabling\" vehicles in neighboring countries which are driven by suspected supporters of opponents of the their regime.  But attempting to carefully identify individuals living in neighbhoring countries whom the YIA thinks might be \"supporting\" Yuki dissidents proves inconvenient, so YIA agents construct a profile describing cars which they think persons assisting Yuki \"extremists\" are likely to drive, say Limecars.  Soon Yuki agents are trying to disable all the Limecars anywhere in the world.  Eventually they designate freeways everywhere as \"free-fire zones\".

At no point have cars or driving been outlawed in any of these countries.  But the government of Yuk has nonetheless constructed a profile which, they announce, describes vehicles driven by people who are \"supporting\" people who may be smuggling porn which is illegal in Yuk, and this government has declared a \"lawful\" open season on vehicles (Limes, then Lemons, then Apples...) which fit their ever expanding profile, anywhere in the world.

Dropping the analogy, let's recall that Opstelten's proposal is almost simultaneous with the announcement by several nations that in future, they will respond to cyberintrusions by launching their own cyberoffensives, or even by launching first strikes when they think they detect preparations for a cyberoffensive targeting computers inside their territory.  I don't think it is unreasonable to be concerned that, while attempting to \"disable\" computers they cannot geolocate but suspect of \"supporting\" the sharing of content which is illegal in the Netherlands, the Dutch cybercops might accidentally trigger all out global cyberwar.
