You're comparing apples to oranges.

> If a Tor User connects from Comcast to a Verizon user then the Verizon user and ISP log will only ever see the Tor Exit node IP address.

Here, you mean a Tor user connecting to a normal internet site provided by a Verizon user. You are correct that the ISP log will only see the Tor Exit node IP, because the user's connection has to exit the Tor network to reach the Verizon user's site.

You should compare this to I2P's outproxies (of which there are only a couple, because I2P is not designed to be a proxy). If an I2P user connected to the Verizon user, then the Verizon user would only see the I2P outproxy IP address (or more likely, they would see a Tor Exit node IP address, since most I2P outproxies chain into the Tor network).

> If a I2P User connects from Comcast to a Verizon user then the Verizon user and ISP log will have a direct address for the comcast users.

Here, you mean an I2P user's router connecting to a Verizon user's router. This is part of normal network function i.e. both the Comcast user and the Verizon user are running I2P, and so the Verizon user's router will be one of the Comcast user's entrypoints into the I2P network.

You should compare this to the Tor user connecting to a Tor relay run by the Verizon user to enter the Tor network. In both cases, a direct connection is made as part of normal I2P/Tor network protocol, and this connection is used along with others in order for the I2P/Tor user to anonymously reach whatever services they are looking for.

The third case (not considered above) is a Tor/I2P user connecting to a .onion/eepsite run by the Verizon user. In this case, both the Comcast and Verizon users are running Tor/I2P, but the connection between them is made through the Tor/I2P network using other computers; as with your first case, *no direct connection is made* between the Comcast and Verizon users, so there are no ISP logs that can connect the two.
