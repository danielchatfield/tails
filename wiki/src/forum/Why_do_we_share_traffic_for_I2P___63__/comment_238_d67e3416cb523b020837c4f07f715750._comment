Not only are long threads like this confusing i would imagine most people would just read the first few original posts and then scroll down to the bottom and miss things.

When we have threads like these that about making changes to Tails and need a Tails developer decision then maybe you could add a footnote to the original post with the
current decision and the reason why so users know a place to read it and then they can scroll to the bottom to continue from that point to keep it on topic.

Just an idea for important changes like these.
