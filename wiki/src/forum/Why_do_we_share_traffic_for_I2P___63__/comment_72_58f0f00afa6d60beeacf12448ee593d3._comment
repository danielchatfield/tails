@ 71: that's exactly right: barely one decade into the new century, we find ourselves living in a world where every citizen with any on-line presence is a potential target (or a potential \"collateral damage\" statistic) in a global cyberwar of numerous well-funded and capable adversaries versus just plain folks.  A particular nation was first to use nukes, first to launch cyberwars, but if that nation hadn't pioneered another probably would have done.

I don't think this brave new world of the technocrats acting for the plutocrats, versus everyone else, can stand for very long.  My long term fear is that the most plausible ways I can forsee for its natural end are catastrophic.  Pretty much the nicest possibility is that a number of nations like the USA and China experience complete economic collapse, followed by political collapse and fragmentation.
