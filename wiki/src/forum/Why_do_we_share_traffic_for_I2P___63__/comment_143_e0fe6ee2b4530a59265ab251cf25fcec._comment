> So extract timing from packets on the router...

Okay. Well the short answer is that yes, given arbitrary resources and enough time, it would be possible to identify an I2P router based on the exact time difference in a packet. That will be an issue in any anonymity network, Tor included. This is why it is very important to have the correct time (and why I2P handles time synchronization itself rather than relying on the router's host machine).

But the resources required to pull off such an attack would be far beyond a single eepsite hoster, as timestamp data would need to be manually harvested from *every single router* in the network database (and quickly enough that the timestamps are not too far apart, as the skew could potentially change). And if the client is in \"hidden mode\", then the task becomes even more intractable, as now you are waiting for the particular router in question to connect to you, in addition to having a large enough skew to be uniquely detectable. There are ways that one could potentially influence a group of routers to connect to an attacker's node (Buddy Exhaustion, Partitioning, possibly flooding with Floodfills), but that would require prior knowledge of the client's location, or more time to perform the attack at random. I2P already contains some defences against these sorts of attacks, but it's not going to be perfect against all possible adversaries. Anonymity is not a boolean =)
