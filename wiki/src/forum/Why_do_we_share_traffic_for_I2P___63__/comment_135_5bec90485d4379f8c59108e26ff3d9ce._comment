most people freak out here without even knowing how tor and i2p works. if you're scared shitless because of i2p then do not start it.

if you think tor is more safe than i2p then you clearly have no idea how this stuff works.

i think it is very important to have i2p avaiable in tails. the network needs more attention and help from people.
