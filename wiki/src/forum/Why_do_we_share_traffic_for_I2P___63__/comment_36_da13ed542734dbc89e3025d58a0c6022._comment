At the end of the day the Tails team go out of their way to hide users IP addresses and online identity and edit and modify Tails to stop users making a direct connection to unknown computers running a webpage via various means of removing digital fingerprints stopping scripts and plugins.

Yet in complete contradiction the Tails team allow users to make direct connections to unknown computers via peer to peer that allows the unknown computers to grab IP addresses and allows 100s of ISPs to record and log their IP address when making these connection.

What crazy ass back to front logic is that?

What difference does it make if a unknown computer is running a webpage or a peer to peer service , either you protect users from making direct connections or you don't but an unknown computer is a unknown computer regardless of the protocol it is running.

As others have said I2P shouldn't be part of Tails and it should be a separate live disk project for those that wish to share their IP address with the world.
