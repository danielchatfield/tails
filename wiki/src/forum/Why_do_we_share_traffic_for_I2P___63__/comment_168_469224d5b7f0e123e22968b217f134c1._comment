about comment 165:

Only stupid and dumb users do use software without knowing what it does, esp. in anonymity and security fields.
So each users SHOULD read the doc and know what he/she does.
So each user is wise and capable of switching of participating tunnels for themselfs.
If a user is not capable of reading the doc and know what to do, using Tails is useless at all. Sorry.

And I2P does NOT share ANYTHING of your content to anyone. Even by accident a user cannot publish any of its local data to the I2P net.
