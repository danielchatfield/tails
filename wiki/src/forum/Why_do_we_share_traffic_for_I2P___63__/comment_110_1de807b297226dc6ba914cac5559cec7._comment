@ good points:

> I agree with the comment that i2p should be started in hidden mode for tails. I2P benifits greatly from i2prouters that are online for very long periods at a time, tails users imo wont fit in to this, and this can have the opposite effect at being helpful to the network 

I'm amazed to see a (basically) good *technical* point after the thread has gone this wild. While this point isn't completely correct, it at least lead me to realize another reason to run I2P in hidden mode which I believe is valid.

It's true that short-lived participating I2P nodes that kill their I2P identity (due to lack of persistence in a live environment) after shutdown are of limited worth to the network since they won't earn enough reputation to relay with full capacity. They won't harm the network, though, just not achieve their full potential. They can improve their reputation somewhat by making the I2P identity persistent (see [[todo item|todo/persistence preset - i2p]]).

As you can see, short-lived participating nodes, with or without persistent I2P identity, are not harmful. What is harmful is to kill I2P ungracefully, and I expect this to be a prevalent behaviour among Tails users. For I2P to shutdown gracefully, it needs up to 11 minutes to let all its current participatory tunnels to expire. Killing I2P before that makes peers using these participatory tunnels experience timeouts and disconnects, which most definitely is bad for the network. Since Tails users are likely to shutdown Tails quickly without waiting these 11 minutes, this is a good reason to enable hidden mode = disable participating traffic.
