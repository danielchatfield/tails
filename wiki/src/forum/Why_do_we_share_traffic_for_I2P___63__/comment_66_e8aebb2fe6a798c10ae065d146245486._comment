>The individual who is spamming this thread with increasingly hysterical abuse is evidently duped by those negative arguments and has a very dark view of human nature.

The fact that you believe that multiple anonymous posts with a normal strong reaction against dark material to be just one individual points to you being delusional who believes their own thoughts and assumptions to be a factual.

And the fact that you see a normal reaction to the subject matter as a negative spam in such a defensive way points to you being a pervert that supports the dark side of I2P and you wish innocent clueless people to continue having their computer used to share dark content to help you fulfill your twisted desires.
