I2P does run on systems with 128MB RAM, usual systems does not use more than 512MB for I2P.

And about Tor: longer circuits (with more than 3 Hops) do not provide more anonymity, in fact they do provide LESS anonymity. (due to fact of higher chance for attacker to be in your circuit, remember: Tor only has 2-3k relays).
The Tor folks do talk about the \"one hop is enough\" problem.
That does not apply to I2P in this strongness, as I2P do use unidirectional tunnels and 10 minutes rotation of tunnels.

Btw, if relaying traffic is illegal, all Tor relays are illegal, to. Which translates to: using Tor is not possible anymore.
