@ \"Tails\" (Comment 218):

> (In retrospect I'd like to add that the IP address leak also would deanonymize any traffic sharing the same circuit, which is really serious.)

But doesn't this validate the fears expressed by some here about enabling i2p under Tails?

Why not proxy i2p through Tor like Liberte does?  If that is not done, doesn't this make it easier to enumerate Tails users by looking for both Tor traffic and i2p sharing?

> Again, this is much more like the Tor Entry/Middle node operator situation, than the Exit node one. Have you seen any Tor Entry/Middle node operator get into trouble for any content they have relayed?

I have not heard of such a case, but isn't the point about the William Weber case that some judges issue decisions (binding unless successfully appealed) which are wildly at variance with national judicial norms?  (If any such thing could even be said to exist in any nation concerning internet law, which I doubt.)

The legal situation in many countries seems to be in a constant state of flux, with enormous and hard-to-understand changes frequently happening (e.g. Phillipines, Russia) and with broad legislative proposals perennially threatening to be quietly enacted on little to no notice (e.g. Canada, USA).

Just to be clear: I am quite intrigued by i2p, but hesitate to try it because I still don't feel that I really understand the risks involved in enabling i2p under Tails.

@ Comment 225:

Thank you!  I had seen the i2p documentation but don't remember seeing your diagrams before, and they are very helpful!

@ Comment 227:

> If this hypothetical government does not outlaw encryption and this hypothetical government follows the presumption of innocence and this hypothetical government adheres to the requirement of probable cause in order to search personal property, then said government would have no basis for such a search.

Yes, but do any actual governments CLEARLY conform to such a description?  I struggle to keep up with the state of privacy laws in many \"Western\" countries, and due to the frequent occurrence of ambitious legislation enacted but not tested in courts, the frequent occurrence of judicially unreviewed claims of extraordinary executive privileges (\"being above the law\", see Morsi and Obama), etc., I don't feel I can name ANY government which really conforms to such a description.  Iceland might come close, but there appear to be serious ambiguities even there.

> In the United States it was not clear, until recently, if a suspect was required to disclose their key for encrypted files on storage devices confiscated during a search. Recent court rulings suggested that if there was no evidence that the encrypted files contained incriminating evidence, then requiring the suspect to decrypt the files would potentially be requiring the suspect to incriminate themselves which is a violation of the suspect's rights.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that decision was not binding in every US jurisdiction, and could very well be moot within a few weeks.  There is a rumor that the American secret police are quietly lobbying hard to attach a rider to any \"fiscal cliff\" compromise bill which will give them everything they have always wanted, including an effective ban on any encryption they cannot easily compromise, putting the onus on service providers to figure out how to ensure this requirement is met (most likely, by simply banning customers from using PGP/GPG and other strong crypto software).

@ Comment 228:

> Being an i2p user is like participating an experiment. Very risky.

I'd have to agree.  Although I appreciate the effort made by some here to explain how i2p works.  One thing which has been lacking so far are posts \"here is an example of how I have used i2p to share content\"

@ Comment 229:

> What you think about law enforcement...

I think you hugely overestimate the abilities, available time, and budget of the average investigator.  Reading police journals suggests that most of them struggle as much as any citizen of somewhat above normal intelligence to understand the relevant technology.  They usually have some training but this doesn't imply that a particular investigator will neccessarily be able to cope with some privacy technique which he hasn't been trained in breaking.

> A computer starting up as a relay has already given itself away and you would not expect Tail Tor users to start up as a Exit node and to disable it after it is already running.

Unless something has changed in the latest edition of Tails, as I understand it, the Tails user has to choose to start up an i2p server, and if he or she doesn't choose to do that, nothing related to i2p will be running.  (\"Tails\", is  that correct?)
