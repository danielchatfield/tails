It seems to me this discussion has mostly been about our motives for weeks (since we added the [[todo/i2p_hidden_mode]] task to our todo list) rather than about what the next thing to do was (since this has been pretty clear since about 6 weeks). I've not seen much new and correct technical information since then.

So, please, someone who cares about this discussion / i2p / whatever, implement [[todo/i2p_hidden_mode]], and let's be done with it?
