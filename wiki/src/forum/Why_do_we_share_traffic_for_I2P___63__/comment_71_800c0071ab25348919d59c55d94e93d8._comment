@69 & 70
I wasn't so much assuming that criminals are lazy so much as that
professional criminals are efficient and wouldn't waste time and money
on a small, difficult target when Windows provides a barn door sized
target. However you make some interesting points and maybe I
underestimate the current state of play. There have been plenty of
reports over the last decade of white-hats demoralized by the torrent
of smart 0day exploits, always being on the back foot reacting to
events rather than shaping them. The situation that you describe
suggests that the fight is finally being returned, and the white-hats
are now using the same weapons and techniques that their adversaries
have been using so successfully for years. That leaves people like you
and me standing helplessly in the middle of a full scale shoot out.
Happy days.
