>doesn't tails run all traffic through tor? doesn't that mean, that all i2p traffic gets routed through tor, too? if this is so, where is the problem?

You are a prime example of what most Tail users wrongly assume and think being that Tails is supposed to be a anonymous Live System.

When using Tails I2P you are no longer using Tor and Iceweasel connects directly into the I2P network giving out your IP address to all the computers connected to it.

Tor Hides the Users Ip Address.

I2P uses the users Ip addresses and computers to hide the I2P sites.

As I2P makes no attempt to hide users Ip address and is the complete opposite of Tor i myself agree with others that it should have never been included with Tails.

It should at least be removed from the desktop menus so users have to start it manually from a system folder for those that really must use it and to protect those that thought it was running through Tor from accidentally starting it.
