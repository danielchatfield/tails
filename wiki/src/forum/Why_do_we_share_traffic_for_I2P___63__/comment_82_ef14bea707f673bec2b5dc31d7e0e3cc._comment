From the Tails documentation:
> I2P is integrated in Iceweasel in such a way that all .i2p addresses are accessed correctly through I2P while all other addresses are handled by Tor, all at the same time.

So there ya go: i2p sharing by those Tail users who start an i2p server is not handled by Tor circuits.   Also, someone seemed to express above a concern that i2p shared content might be stored in /tmp files in a persistent volume, but I assume until told otherwise that it lives only in RAM when a Tails user enables i2p.
