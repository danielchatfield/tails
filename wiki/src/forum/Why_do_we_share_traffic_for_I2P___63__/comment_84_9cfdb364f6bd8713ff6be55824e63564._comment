Your IPaddress is not hidden or anonymized and doesn't stop IP tracking and your computer is used as a relay on behalf of I2P websites to share it's contents without your control and you make a Anonymous computer stand out by all the traffic it generates even with constant handshake packets hours after I2P is stopped.

What difference does it make how well encrypted the internal working of I2P are and what the hell does your persistent volume have to do with it if your computer and internet connection is already being used to share encrypted terrorist content or anything else that is illegal?
