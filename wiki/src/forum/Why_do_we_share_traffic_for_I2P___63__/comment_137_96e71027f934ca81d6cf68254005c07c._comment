str4d give it a rest , I2P is full of holes and you are not anonymous or protected.

If you connect to a tor-hidden server (which could be a honey pot data miner) through Tor then the hidden server will never get your Ip address.

If you run I2P and the tor-hidden server is also running I2P as most now are then at some point the Tor hidden server running I2P will log your Ip address which could be a source of a drive by exploit if the Tor hidden server is trying to plant a payload via Tor to a target computer.
