>comment 85 So if i was using Comcast and i connected to a I2P user on Verizon then both ISPs would log our ip address connection and association with each other ???

>Yes. So the situation is the same as with Tor; both ISPs can see that one of them is a Tor client since the other is a Tor relay, which is public knowledge.

What the hell are you on about.

If a Tor User connects from Comcast to a Verizon user then the Verizon user and ISP log will only ever see the Tor Exit node IP address.

If a I2P User connects from Comcast to a Verizon user then the Verizon user and ISP log will have a direct address for the comcast users.
