first of, yes - when you use i2p it uses 2 or 3 hops (depending on settings).

but hey, if you use tor you are in the same position. how do you all think tor connects to its nodes? yes, with your ip adress that the isp can log.

using tor does not make you invisible at your isp. neither does i2p. your isp can always see that you either connect to a tor node or to an i2p node. so where is the problem. 

if you do not like using i2p then do not start it.

rule #1 in linux - know what you are doing!
