>Comments 86 and 88 - you sorely misunderstand how I2P operates. I2P does NOT make direct connections between a client (user of data) and server (provider of data), except in the corner case where both client and server have independently chosen to use zero-hop tunnels, which is by no means the default and not at all recommended.

Dumbass idiot.

Users 86 and 88 are correct as tails users are currently setup to act as a relay so they connect to a I2P website on other I2P users behalf and pass the data on to them so your IP address is logged on the target machine and the ISP host.

1)Pervert wishes to look at a I2P site with bestiality and I2P site also runs a Tor-Hidden server.

2)pervert send request to relays (tails users inc ) to hide him and his request.

3)Relay (tails users inc ) connects to I2P bestiality site and sends data back to pervert.

So Tails users are making direct connects to target machines such as tor-hidden server machines and are having their IP addresses logged.
