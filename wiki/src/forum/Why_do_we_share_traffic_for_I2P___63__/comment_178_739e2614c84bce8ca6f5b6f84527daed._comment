Whole lotta privacy haters itt

No, if you look at the consistently over-the-top aggression of the
haters on this thread and their use of phrases such as 'you truly are
a idiot aren't you', 'Dumbass idiot', 'illegal shit', 'dumb shit',
'dumb fuck nut', numb nuts', 'Dumb Fuck', 'dumb nuts', etc it becomes
clear that this is just one person with a limited vocabulary who is
passionately against i2p and thinks that their argument gains weight
through repetition and the confrontational language.
