With Tor the only computers that ever know your Ip address is your ISP and the entry Tor Nodes.

With I2P everybody knows your IP address as you are making multiple connection to 100s of computers across 100s of networks so why would you go to all that effort to hide your IP address with Tor but give it away with I2P.

It defys any logic or reason because if your going to make connections to 100s of computers then why bother to use Tor and why don't you just connect direct to web pages because as someone has already said a computer is a computer so why treat the connections as different.

I2P is not Amnesic Incognito as once your IP address is logged it is remembered
So as others are saying it has no place with Tor so it should be run as a separate project or at least the Tails team should release a Tails ISO build with each release without I2P installed.
