Who ever they are quoting they are quoting the truth.

As others have said I2P shouldn't even be included in Tails as the only thing I2P protects is the original webpage as it doesn't protect the Tails/I2p user as it works arse up and back to front compared to Tor as I2P webpages uses Tails/I2P users to hide behind.

It doesn't matter how many layers of people the Data passes through or how heavily it's encrypted as Law Enforcers will always know what files they are downloading and the IP-Address of the computers making a direct connect to them relaying the file.So if you are not prepared to be a Tor Exit Node then you shouldn't be a I2P relay as you are under the same liability and chances of being prosecuted for helping to transfer illegal material on behalf of others and this is being done to Tails users without most of them knowing.

It's highly irresponsible the way Tails has included I2P as most users are clueless how it works and under the impression they are anonymous and one thing you are not is anonymous when you are relaying traffic to a Law Enforcer.

This is why Libert√© Linux has I2P relay disabled and runs I2P through Tor instead of making direct connections to anybody.The way Tails has I2P setup puts a big question of doubt over the entire Tails project and its integrity at protecting users and keeping them anonymous as to quote someone else in this thread \" The Tails team have really screwed up on this one.\"
