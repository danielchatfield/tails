Thank you for your quick reply.

Sorry, I should have numbered my queries, my mistake.

The power shut-off is a hardware problem (loose screw) but it's not that much of a problem. Easily fixed, I just wanted to check.

I've already tried getting Ubuntu. Using Unetbootin I've tried to write it onto my USB (Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32GB) but every time I try to boot up from it, I keep getting a \"Operating System not found\" message. I'm a real noob when it comes to computers, but I've followed the instructions (of Unetbootin), everything seems like it's going well, but when I boot up, still nothing. Maybe I'm making a mistake somewhere along the line? I'm a real noob when it comes to computers, so if my mistake is really obvious, I apologize.

Again, thank you for replying.
