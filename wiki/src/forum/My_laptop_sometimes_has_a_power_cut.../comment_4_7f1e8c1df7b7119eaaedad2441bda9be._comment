@ OP:

Your power supply issues are likely to cause all kinds of mysterious problems, I think.  One point to bear in mind is that this could not only damage your file system but could potentially cause unpredictable degradation of your anonymity/security due to generally unpredictable behaviour of your system.

So I think you need to get your power supply fixed.  Erm... \"loose screw\"?  I can't picture that, but anyway, good luck.
