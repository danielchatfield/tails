would have helped if you numbered your questions.

anyway am going to try an help you :)

If you are running off a livecd then the shutdown should not be too much of a problem or cause an problem to your Tails livecd. It most likely or maybe a hardware issue with your laptop e.g. power supply ? battery ? forgetting to pay the electric bill (only kidding) ?

Do not see why you could not use Tails for you day to day. Corporate journalist and citizen journalist use Tails under extreme circumstances, so I doubt it be dangerous.

As you are already using Tails which is based on Debian operating system why not download and install a copy of Ubuntu http://www.ubuntu.com/download as it is a family of Debian operating system.

Best of all it is free and as reliable and better than M$ Windows. You will probably be less likely to be infested by virus and malware.

Hope to have helped
