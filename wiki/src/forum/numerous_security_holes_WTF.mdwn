ok I do realize the need to update but that Numerous security holes phrase is a tad dramatic . So you seem to be saying after a short while every release of Tails gewts full of security holes and my anonimity (and my life in some cases) is at risk if I DONT UPGRADE . It seems to undermine the very reason Tails exists and worries me a lot
