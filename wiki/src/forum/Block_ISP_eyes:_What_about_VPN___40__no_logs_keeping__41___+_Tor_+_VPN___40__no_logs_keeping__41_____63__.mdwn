What do you think about this to Block ISP eyes that i'm using Tor and VPN sees Tor IP.

1. For ISP protection: Connect to a VPN that keeps no logs which was a created with a fake name/email and paid with bitcoin

2. Connect to Tor (which Tor entry sees VPN IP)

3. For whatever protection: Connect to a VPN that keeps no logs which was a created with another fake name/email and paid with bitcoin and VPN sees Tor Exit IP with this setup for ex: https://airvpn.org/tor/

I have this setup and it's fast
