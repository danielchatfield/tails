Hi,

If you install Tails this (unsupported) way, you have to know that:

1. GRUB2 can fail to boot on some 'buggy' Phoenix BIOSes.
2. The \"wipe memory on shutdown\" feature does not work if you don't append 'initrd=/live/initrd.img' to the kernel boot commandline (this is not new, and detailed [here](https://tails.boum.org/forum/LiveUSB__44___fromiso__61____42____44___GRUB2_and___39__wipe_memory__39___feature)).
3. The \"wipe memory on removal\"/udev-watchdog feature doesn't work.
4. You will be unable to create an encrypted persistent volume with the desktop utility done for that.
5. probably more

So, you should test the result of your work before saying 'hey! hey! Here I am!'. There are some reasons why some installation methods are not supported by Tails developpers. If you find a way to work around my points 3 and 4 (and this is probably the same), I'll be glad.

Regards.
