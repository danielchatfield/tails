The point that you are quoting from [[/todo/include_bitcoin/]] is that it wouldn't be a good idea to use bitcoin from Tails without using the persistent volume. In that perspective people willing to use bitcoin from Tails can also use the [[APT Lists|/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#apt_lists]] and [[APT Packages|/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#apt_packages]] options from the same persistent volume.

If people are willing to try out that solution, audit the corresponding software and its configuration, that could be something to include in the documentation, but maybe not ship by default in Tails.

But as far as I know, that's not a big priority for the developping team. Maybe you are willing to take on this task?
