I see. well it is conforting at least to see that projects with so many possibilities are not thougthlessly discarded as I had feared. It is fine that bitcoin/namecoin/mining/and hopefully documentation plus eventuall interface for noobs (like me) to do things like I described above is not a big priority for developers. Indeed making sure tails is resistant to time attacks and incremental updates + automatizing builds in order to make new versions of Tails less buggy are things that will help out a lot on the long run and should be implemented asap. Still, I hope to have persuaded you that the possibilities of a fusion between the software I mentioned and Tails are too good to be overlooked forever.

Regarding helping out, I would like to help implement this feature, but I am not very sure I can (sure I have very little free time but that is true for anyone).
Thing is Tails is my first linux and I am not from the IT field although I like to think about how things could be done. If only coding was as easy as thinking..

That said, I will help as I can. For the moment, that implies learning what apt lists and apt packages are all about, especially in the contex of persistence, and I will try to work from there to installing programs in linux/tails and such.. regarding auditing..if you mean wireshark I am clueless in that field and I doubt I can help at all with it.

Last but not least you mentioned that while whorthy to include in the documentation, perhaps it should not be shipped as default in tails. While your reasoning is perfectly logical from a tecnical pov, i still disagree. The power of default is a very powerfull thing, and something that only the developer team can enact. If included only in the documentation, even with a step by step tutorial for noobs, only people who are activelly searching for it or willing to go the extra mile will do it. For situations like I described above it would be best if people \"stumbled\" into the bitcoin/namecoin/mining/interface software and after getting curious and learning about it and how persistence had to be activated, proceeded with confidence as the software had been carefully audited by tails, and they could not unwittingly screw it up.

I will now proceed to learn more about linux and tails and the concepts I talked above although I fear my tecnical skills are insuficient to help in an meaningfull way. If you disagree, please let me know what I can specifically do help tails implement this feature.
