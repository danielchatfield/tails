Yes, your thread is off-topic and it would be nice to stick to matters related to Tails on this forum. Or don't expect to be always answered.

Apart from that, I never tried the solution you are describing above but I guess that would work. It seems to me that the setup would work even without namecoin. Then people would just go through tor2web. If you are worried about DNS censorship also keep in mind that tor2web could be censored.
