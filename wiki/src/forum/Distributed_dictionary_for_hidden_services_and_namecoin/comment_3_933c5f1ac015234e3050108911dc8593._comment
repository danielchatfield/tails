Also you said that tor2web could be censored, but what if we were talking about tor2web.bit? It could no longer be censored at least at dns level.

Now imagine the following situation:

Namecoin and Namecoin mining are included in Tails => A blogger in china uses Tails (in a possible future obfsproxy bridje mode) to mine untracable namecoins => Uses said namecoins to secure a dot.bit domain on the normal web (for exemple myblog.bit or even other more extreme situations like piratebay.bit or wikileaks.bit) through Tor thus remaining anonymous => the dot.bit domain then points to tor2web.bit/ giberish.onion and suddently...=> uncensorable (at dsn level), anonymous, convinient publishing on the normal web! that leaves ip for censors to target but it surely would be a step towards a world wide darkweb!

The possibilities would be staggering! and if you were to add bitcoin/namecoin mining as previously suggested:
https://tails.boum.org/forum/Bitcoin__47__Namecoin_Mining/

You could also have anonymous donations in the mix. This donations could for example be used to pay the hosting of said blog on a server running tor and hidden services 24/7 (who knowns?! a Tails server?! when the project resumes that is) somewhere on the world, or electricitry bills if you leave your laptop running Tails at home).

I was sad when I saw you are considering NOT supporting Bitcoin:
https://tails.boum.org/todo/include_bitcoin/

If you are intrigeri, I disagree with you. I think you are dismissing a world of possibilities for easily solved tecnical reasons.

I do not know how to program, but would a simple solution for the issue you raised not be for example: Adding a checkbox on Tails greater (below read only for exemple) which said: Enable Bitcoin/Namecoin? Or maybe a more generalistic solution: Enable Blockchains? (if other usefull blockchains are started). Then a long Tails session would only happen for the users who want the blockchains activated. It would not slow down Tails for a user that does not use then nor would it slow down the users who used the feature when they didn't want it.
