Thank you for your answer. I understand of course.

True but I think that blocking a particular blog, or a service like tor2web that serves a lot of things are two very diferent reactions in terms of determination of an adversary. I have no adversary (at this moment at least and to my knowledje) so my question was teorical in nature.

You say it could work even without namecoin, but if I want the dns name to be atractive other than giberish it provides an advantage. To your knowledje do you know if namecoin could be used within the Tor network?

It seams a fusion between hidden services and namecoin would be very useful for tor users with hidden services at least..
