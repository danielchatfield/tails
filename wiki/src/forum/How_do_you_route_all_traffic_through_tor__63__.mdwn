Hi,
I've been trying my best to get one of my ubuntu server vm's to route all traffic through tor, but the guides I've found does not work for me.

I want it to work just like tails.
All data coming out of the box should go through tor.

I tried with the firewall rules in tails, but is there more I'm missing?

Tor itself works just fine on my server, all I need help with is the routing.

Can someone enlighten me on this?

Thanks in advance!
