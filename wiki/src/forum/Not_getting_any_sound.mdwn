Both in Tails 0.12 and 0.13, I have not been able to get any sound to play through my headset.  I have checked the sound control and all channels are unmutted and fine.  If I unmute the microphone on the headset, I can hear it picking up what I am saying, however nothing plays back if I try to record something to test it.  No media sound plays either.
