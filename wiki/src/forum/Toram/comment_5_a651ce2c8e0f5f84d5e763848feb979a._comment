>there must be a way to delete keyboardinputs from ram while im working. else, this seems to me a security-issue

The Debian OS, on which Tails in based, is **NOT** perfect. **NO** software can ever be free of security issues.

Why is that so?

Suppose you are a believer of the Divine Creation hypothesis. Have you ever asked yourself how a perfect being (the Divine Creator) could have created an imperfect world that we live in?

So then the logical conclusion is: How can a created being such as us, the human race, create something that perfect? It's illogical, right?
