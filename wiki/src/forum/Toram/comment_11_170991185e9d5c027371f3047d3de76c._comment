\"It is widely known (and was already stated in the forum) that if a remote attacker can gain access to a system, mounting drives on it is fairly easy.\"

But that was not the context given in the post.  The context given in that case was browser infection by malware while booted toram writing to hard drives, not a remote attacker gaining a root shell. That is a different scenario.  Link to documentation of this threat found in the wild is required, otherwise I call bullshit.

The best way to get hacked on tails or any system running tor would be to install browser plugins or other software that has been trojaned via social engineering (which has been done before only a year or so ago by hackers placing a trojaned 'update' to a popular plugin on an onion site) - or for the tails repo to get hacked and the isos themselves to be trojaned and gpg sigs altered.
