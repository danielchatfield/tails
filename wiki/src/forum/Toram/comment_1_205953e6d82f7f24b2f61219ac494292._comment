Any input from your keyboard will be stored in RAM until your PC is effectively shut down and the contents of the RAM are wiped/erased. That means any information that you type will be available in RAM for any geek to hack.

If you visit a malicious website that contains malware, the latter will be stored in RAM as well. Some malware are crafted in such a way that once they are in RAM, they will infect the data on your hard disk drive
