First, unless this has changed recently, the `toram` boot option is *not supported*. (IOW, you are entirely at your own risk should you decide to try it.)

As for what comment 1 describes, I fail to see how all of that isn't already true even when *not* using `toram`. Just because the DVD or USB stick is continually read from doesn't mean that there isn't also A LOT going on with the RAM.
