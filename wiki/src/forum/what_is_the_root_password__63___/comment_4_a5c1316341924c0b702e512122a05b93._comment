Well, thenx for the answer.
It seems to me I am doing something wrong then.
Since I'm trying to use new Tails 0.12.1 boot LiveCD, I still have no access to local HDD c:\ (because it want password), and also still no access to LAN internet (set the IPv4 wired connection address, mask, gateway, DSN server numbers just doesn't work).

I am wonder what is so different in tails 0.12.1, ubuntu 13, mint 13 (in all these new versions set LAN doesn't work) - 'cos everythink work perfectly in old tails 0.10.2, ubuntu 11, mint 11, xp, vista, win7, on all 5 notebooks and PC I've tryed :-(.


After 2 weeks of searching and reading tons of manuals & instructions - I just give up. Going back to old - working - versions ... :-(
