I tried 

`apt-get update` 

and then

`apt-get install iceweasel`

not more than a week ago.

The download was around 260 MB because of all the dependencies, which included numerous language packages.

When the downloading finally finished, I got a message that not all files could be downloaded. It was all for nought. 

Is there a safe way of eliminating all of the language stuff?

>bump !

Unfortunately, on this forum, replying to a thread does not seem to bump it.
