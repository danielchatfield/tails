> Is there a (safe) way to skip all those language packages when updating Iceweasel?

It would require playing with [[!debpkg equivs]] or similar.

> Can running (the now 5+ weeks old) TAILS 0.12.1 \"out of the box\" (i.e., without updating anything) still be considered relatively safe?

As an introduction, let me state that there is no such thing as \"100% safe\". Tails 0.12.1 contains software that has important known security issues. This is a major problem. We must fix that. Fixing that won't, unfortunately, fix every possible security issue that may be present, and not publicly known yet, in iceweasel or other software.
