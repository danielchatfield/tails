I you're really that concerned that this post is the best CIA/MI6/MOSSAD/Whoever can come up with, in order to subvert development of Tails, then why not create an email account for the purpose and \"become\" a \"Tails developer\"? I'm sure \"Dima\" would love to hear from you (amongst all the other bizarre chaff this post is bound to generate) and discuss the despicable plans/requirements with YOU.

Quite

>Accepting possible shady jobs on tails forum is, to say the least, risky. Even for the developers let alone the project.

For the good of the project, all Tails contributors must immediately be gathered up and installed into sealed clear glass cubicles, each with enough area and soil for the contributor within to subsist. About half an acre per unit should suffice. Think of the cubicles as giant versions of the vivaria which where all the rage with the Victorians. Each **c**ontributor **h**ermetostasis **u**nit (or **CHU** for short) must be suspended by glass fibres from the ceiling of a sealed stainless steel cube - the **F**araday **C**HU **e**nclosure or **FCE**. In each of the FCEs 8 corners will be a \"nuclear battery\" powered floodlight. At the middle of each of the FCEs 6 walls there will be one foot diameter hole over which has been welded a fine silver plated steel mesh - thus forming a **c**ontributor **o**bservation **p**ortal (**CHP**). Outside each FCE 6 HD cameras will be positioned to continuously relay the view through every CHP to the Tails website. The Tails contributors will convey their ideas, code contributions and any other communications directly to the Tails user-base via sign language.
