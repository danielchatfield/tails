Hi, all! Actually, I am quite surprised seeing that my humble request has arisen such interesting discussion.

Definitely, this is not backdoor or something and MOSSAD has nothing to deal with this project. We are building our own secured live-usb solution for corporate customers and were looking for experienced engineers that were involved in Tails project. Therefore they have enough experience in the field.

We already have found the executor, but gladly will accept new contacts for further communications. The project has big potential and some new ideas have born already.

So, all interested are welcomed to write me.

Regards,

Dima
