>What? As opposed to using Tails with a contract your name is linked to?

If anonymity is very important for you, first get yourself a fake identification card. *Depending on your locality, it is usually the local mafia who are able to help you on this. Or, if you live in a country where the local police are also the mafia, the better it is for you.*

Next, go to an internet cafe to use Tails. If the cafe needs identification papers, show them your fake ID card.

Stick your pre-prepared Tails Live USB into the computer and you are good to go.

P.S.: I learned the above trick from reading spy thrillers and watching James Bond 007 movies.
