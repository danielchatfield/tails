Isn't Tails what anonymity is all about? So why the sarky comments? This forum is attracting more and more immature children and trolls. Doubt they even realise how pathetic they sound. All I wanted to know is whether the way my modem is connecting sounds okay. I don't want to find out down the line that my connection is unsafe due to it not connecting properly. Don't worry, I won't ask another question here again.
