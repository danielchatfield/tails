Whether it is trolls or immature or misguided people answering you please don't be offended :)

Also remember that other people may know less about the technical stuff, try to help regardless, and give a bad answer (as that one on 3G vs wired/wireless) which does not qualify them as any of the above. Only as in being in the beginning stages of the anon stuff learning curve.

Comment 5 on the other hand...probably does qualify to what you said. Either that or has some seriously dangerous adversaries (which is doubtful from the ps..)

Once I also tried and failed to connect with a Vodafone 3G USB Modem. Perhaps I should have asked here as you did. If its a bug it's the way to move stuff forward ;)
