Hello. I have been using Tails and before it the Tor Browser Bundle for a couple of years now. There is one forum site in particular that I use it for. Evidently that forum (or its ISP) disallows connections based on geolocation attribution to specific countries (I think that approach is wrong-headed for any number of reasons, but I do understand the possible motivation) Anyway, up until Tails v 0.11 I believe I was able to force Vidalia to obtain a new apparent IP address (the address seen by the destination server) with the "use a new identity" widget. Whether that action was the cause ot not, using previous versions the IP address was not at all persisent, and after it changed I would more often than not be able to access the site in question. I seem to recall that I saw a proposed change to what happens when the user triggers "use a new identity" on the list of future goals for Tails. Has this been done already in any way? I can understand that there would be some advantages to a more persistent apparent IP address, but as I believe my example shows, there is seldom a change without both gain and loss. Can anyone shed more light on what may be happening in v 0.11 in this regard? Can anyone share a method that can force an IP address change in this version? Thanks.
