For the \"Tails devs\" to attempt to \"secure\" a public wiki like this would do nothing but damage their reputation - and that of the project.

Anyway, you can *already* verify the SSL cert's fingerprint. Without misleading/confusing the \"noobs\" too:

1. Connect to the website and save the fingerprint.

2. Create a new Tor circuit, reconnect to this site and check the fingerprint.

3. Repeat 2 a few times.

4. Start the unsafe browser and check the fingerprint using that.

5. Use that saved fingerprint to verify the cert on all subsequent visits, while, for the next few weeks or so, you keep an eye on the IT news outlets for stories about the Tails site being hacked.

That's probably about as good as you'll get unless you're certain that you personally know the \"dev\" with the keys - and it's *much* better than using a pgp key downloaded from the site it's supposed to protect! (and that's what this idea would effectively amount to - for the vast majority of users - snake oil!)
