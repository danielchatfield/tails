>For the \"Tails devs\" to attempt to \"secure\" a public wiki like this would do nothing but damage their reputation - and that of the project.

Incorrect


This would have no effect if for example, a powerful adversary, or well placed nefarious network administrator, where to spoof the tails website from a network in or close to the tails webservers upstream provider


There are already a number of alternate methods of verifying the signing public key, see the [documentation](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html)

An extensive verification of the tails signing key is what is needed to be done, which you should be doing anyway to then verify the .iso images. The extensively verified tails signing key can then be used as a root of trust to verify other items related to tails
