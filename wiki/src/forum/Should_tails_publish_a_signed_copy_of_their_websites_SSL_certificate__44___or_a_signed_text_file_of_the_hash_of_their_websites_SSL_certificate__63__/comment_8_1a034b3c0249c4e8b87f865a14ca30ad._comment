>This would have no effect if for example, a powerful adversary, or well placed nefarious network administrator, where to spoof the tails website from a network in or close to the tails webservers upstream provider

Hence step 5. You think a wholesale attack like this could be maintained over long periods without being detected?

>There are already a number of alternate methods of verifying the signing public key, see the documentation

Yes, thanks for the link, have you read that page? You do realise that the process you're attempting to debunk is [the first method recommended on that page](https://tails.boum.org/doc/get/trusting_tails_signing_key/index.en.html#index1h1)?

As \"the web of trust\" barely exists and few users will personally know Tails/Debian developers, this \"verification by correlation\" process is *the only* method of any significant use!

>An extensive verification of the tails signing key is what is needed to be done, which you should be doing anyway to then verify the .iso images.

Of course. That is what *is* being done... by those following the recommended practices anyway.

>The extensively verified tails signing key can then be used as a root of trust to verify other items related to tails

Naturally. As is indeed being done. In fact, this is exactly how almost all users should verify their copy of the .iso
