>Strawman attack, and not a very good one at that

Nope. Impossible without a different certificate & therefore fingerprint. The straw cert's fingerprint wouldn't match the real one. No doubt a \"dev\" or two, along with much of the existing user-base would find that alarming.

>Note, if you're claiming your \"method\" to be the same as the first one listed in the documentation then please note the documentation also states they list the methods in order of least secure to most secure, so congratulations, you're advocating the least secure method

Also note, that method is *the only* viable option to most users. For certificates **or** keys.
