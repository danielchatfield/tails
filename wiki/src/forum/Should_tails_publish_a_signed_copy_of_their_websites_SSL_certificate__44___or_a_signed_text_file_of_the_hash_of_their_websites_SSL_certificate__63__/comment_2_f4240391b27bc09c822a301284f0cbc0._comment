I agree to many just dont perform cryptographic validation themselves, don't know how or don't want to (or both)

I would check the key myself, it could be verified once (tails signing key signed textfile of SHA1 hash of web server certificate for example), and then the expected hash stored in a text file in the persistence folder, it is then simply a matter of opening the text file, and also clicking the https icon in the web browser, clicking view certificate, and then reading the SHA1 hash and making sure its the same as in the text file


Someone could completely root the GANDI SAS infrastructure and it would have no effect


Firefox could also implement certificate pinning, i.e. providing a simple user interface for a user to pin a specific certificate to a specific website, or to pin a particular certifying authority to a specific website which google does in chrome manually and only for their own webservers
