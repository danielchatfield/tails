Hi, I can see several solutions:

1. If the computer is yours, you could install an alternative
and secondary bootloader on it (plop, grub2 or any other with usb support) and configure it if necessary to boot TailsUSB.

2. Boot from the LiveDVD with your LiveUSB inserted: when the
boot menu appears, hit \<Tab\>, then modify
'live-media=removable'
to 'live-media=removable-usb' and hit \<Enter\>. This could do the job. Eject the LiveDVD.

3. Considering that you need at least 700MB of RAM to run Tails,
if the BIOS don't allow you to boot from USB, I think the computer is old and don't has enough RAM to run Tails comfortably. Good luck.
