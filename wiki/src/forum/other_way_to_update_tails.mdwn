I'm sorry if this is not correct way to ask questions about this.

is there any known security problems if user updates older usb-tails just by mounting and copying new "live" directory (and possibly others that exist in USB) from iso to usb drive? 

Surely iso needs to be verified and computer needs to be trusted.
