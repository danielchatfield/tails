What kind of information is needed? Just doesn't connect to Internet via login/pass, although a cable connection with provider is set (shows internal ip like 10.*.*.25, speed 100 Mbit/s and so on...)

In Windows and some other live cds (like Fedora 12) is everything ok - connects and works just fine!

I tried to make some snapshots via PrintScreen btn, but the system resolved about gnome-paint error or something...
