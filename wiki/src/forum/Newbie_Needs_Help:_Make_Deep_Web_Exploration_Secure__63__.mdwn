I literally learned about the Deep Web and Tor a few days ago, and am interested in exploring this new area of the internet.  

I have enough savvy to get Tor up and running correctly on my system, but are there any other specific programs I should be running as well to keep myself secure, such as Firewalls and the like?  If so which ones work best with Tor?  Are there any other precautions I should take before I dive in?
