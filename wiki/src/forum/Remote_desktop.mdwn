Hello.
English is not my native lang, so sorry ;) but i hope u will understand.

1)
I'm looking for a remote desktop to use it threw Tor. I mean that when i connect to a dedicated server my own Ip wouldn't be compromised.

Does it looks like this?
My PC (RDP Client) -> Node 1 -> ... -> Node N -> Dedicated server (RDP Server)

or it will connect directly?
My PC (RDP Client) -> Dedicated server (RDP Server)
so my IP will be compromised?

2)
I can't find RDP client in Talis.

When i'm trying to install:
"sudo apt-get install remmina remmina-plugin-rdp"

i get:
