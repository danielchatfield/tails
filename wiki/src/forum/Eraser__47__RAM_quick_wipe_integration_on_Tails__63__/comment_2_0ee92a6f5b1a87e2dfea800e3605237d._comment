> To add to the extreme security procedure, wouldn't it be a neat idea to integrate Heidi Eraser freeware and custom-programmed RAM quick wipe option (automated every 15 minute or manual click) within Tails OS operating on booted DVD-R or thumb drive?

Most of the information that one would like to wipe would, most likely, still be in RAM, so such a quick wipe procedure would, in most case, not gain much. OTOH, it's likely it would have a serious impact on performance and system reliability.

Tails ships with the SSH client, so yes.

> Will there be the replacement for TrueCrypt in current development, with GPG encryption?

What are you missing, exactly? See [[doc/first_steps/persistence]] and [[doc/encryption_and_privacy/encrypted_volumes]].

> Norton software maker owns PGP and that made me uneasy.
