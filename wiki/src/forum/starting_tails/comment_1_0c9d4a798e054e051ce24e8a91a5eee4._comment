\"starting tails\" means one of the following:

 - burn a tails DVD and boot your PC with it
 - boot your PC from a tails USB stick you already have

you'll probably want to use this method to create a working tails USB stick:

then boot with it and create another tails USB stick using the included \"tails USB installer\" (which is preferred over manual installation)
