Hello
I'm using tails on note and have such problem:

When I use persist volume after botting gnome noutilus all the time is segfault and after automaticaly starts.

The problem is very similar as described here:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/461418

"kernel: [10417.224943] nautilus[8957]: segfault at b6e47fdc ip 06bf5760 sp b6e47fe0 error 6 in libgvfsdbus.so[6bd9000+24000]"

Work around of this problem is deleting the ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata

Help pls to fix this problem right way
Thank You
