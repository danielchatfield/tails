Quoting [Top changes in Tor since the 2004 design paper (Part 1)](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/top-changes-tor-2004-design-paper-part-1)Â :

> **Tunneling directory connections over Tor**
>
> In 0.1.2.5-alpha (Jan 2007), we added support by default for clients to download all directory documents over HTTP over Tor, rather than by contacting directories and caches over unencrypted HTTP. This change helps clients resist fingerprinting.
> 
> Because clients aren't using Tor for anonymity on directory connections, they build single-hop circuits. We use HTTP over a one hop Tor circuit, rather than plain old HTTPS, so that clients can use the same TLS connection both for a directory fetch and for other Tor traffic.
