> I don't see the point of verifying the torrent file and then further verifying the iso. Does this dual verification add security?

 * By verifying the .torrent file, you verify that you do use the torrent we published.

 * By verifying the downloaded ISO, you verify that the Tails version you downloaded is the right one, and nobody played with your connection or a tracker to get you to download a malicious Tails version.

Does it also answer to your last question? I'm not sure to understand it, so I don't know what to reply.
