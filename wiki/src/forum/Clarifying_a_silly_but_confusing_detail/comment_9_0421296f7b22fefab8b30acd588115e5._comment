> while the ones who will not (probably due to technical inexperience as I doubt any who use this software would not care) will not be able to verify neither the torrent file nor the iso.

We try to document comprehensive and easy way to do so, hope it helps users to stick on verifying.

> I also asked what is the point of the signature to be included in the torrent if it can also be verified by downloading it through the website.

It doesn't cost anything to do so, so why not? At least people don't have to go back on the website to get the sig once the download is finished. Bring little convenience for no cost.

> in that situation would the attacker not alter the torrent file signature and include a fake tails iso signature in the torrent file 

To be able to sign with tails gpg key, the attacker has to own the private gnupg key. Thus hacking the website won't allow the attacker to sign its fake files with our key. He'd have to take other more difficult steps to do so.
