No, I did not. 

I remember vaguely seeing some threads related with problems downloading/verifying tails by torrent, but when downloading by torrent gave bad signature for me I just went back to direct downloading which worked.
I figured out that I might be doing something wrong just now and posted my suggestion for clarification. But I agree other users may have been confused by this as I was.

Still, and on a general note, the torrent download while faster and more convenient does still present some problems at the moment. You cannot download tails anonymously from within tails by torrent for one. And even if the cryptographic signature is included in the torrent, then you would not be able to use the seahorse plugin to help verifying the image.

Perhaps further clarifying that the signature included in the torrent is the same used for the iso verification by direct downloading is useful? In fact however, and I may be missing something here, I don't see the point of verifying the torrent file and then further verifying the iso. Does this dual verification add security? And does verifying the torrent iso with the included signature add security as well when compared with the signature from the website, or does it diminish it as if the torrent download gets corrupted or hacked in any way we are verifying it with something not trustworthy?
