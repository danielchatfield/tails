What happens when I set another Proxy for HTTP/SSL in Iceweasel (Edit/Preferences/Advanced/Network/Settings)?
I would think TAILS will set-up the proxy-connection via TOR.


(I know that maybe not the recommended use, but it would solve some problems with sites blocking TOR.)

Greets and as always thanks for the great TAILS,
