Javascript is still enabled by default. Most people browsing the web has no idea of what Javascript is. But they really easily get the idea that their favourite website does not work with Tailsâ€¦ and then return to their favourite Windows system full of malware.

Javascript will stay enabled by default.

I've read a few people that wanted to add an option to disable Javascript as part of the login greeter. No one came up with code to do it, though. If you really care, [[please help|contribute]].
