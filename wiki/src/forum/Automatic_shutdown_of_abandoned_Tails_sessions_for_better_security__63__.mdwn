It is only when the adversary catches Tails running that they can get your information. 

So how about automatically (completely with wipe) shutting down by default? 

At least after an hour, when it's clear the user has abandoned the session, and are just leaving their information vulnerable to capture?

I know you are working on the locking screensaver. But how about doing this additional step next for completely securing the session automatically when it's clear it really has been abandoned?
