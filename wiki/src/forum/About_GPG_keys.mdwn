Hello, I'm a totally noobie with Tails. Forgive this silly question.

I had operated GPGkeys manage program such as GPGshell with window os system.

After booting Tails, I tried to create a key pair.But what I got is only public key. Generally,GPG key pair should be with two key, one is public key to encrypt, and another one is secret key to decrypt.
I just couldn't find the secret key.

Did I lost something or some what?Or operating inappropriately? 

Thank you for reading.

Cheers.
