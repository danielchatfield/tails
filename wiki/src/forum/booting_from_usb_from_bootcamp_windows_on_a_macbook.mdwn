I've looked at a number of threads and it looks as if this might be possible. I just have to change my BIOS order in windows, right? Or does a bootcamp'd version of windows not have those bios options. I tried pressing f2 as I booted windows and it didn't recognize my recently formatted tails usb (that I had made using tails booted from dvd).

I've just burned a rEFit dvd. Perhaps I will be able to access the tails usb from there.
 
I'm sorry if this is a repeat. I'm just hoping this can happen!
