If you do anything involving lots of text processing under Linux, you almost certainly rely heavily on shell scripting, which relies on the pipe.  So I find I often

    cat file | first_action | second_action | third_action 

and so on.

Gpg has built-in commands which use a special protocol for importing/exporting keys directly to/from your keyring.  In the early days of Tor I believe that was not always automatically done via Tor, and even today I am not sure that using that particular protocol has been audited.  Although it is probably safe to use the built-in commands, I recommend playing it safe and retrieving keys using http via TBB or the Tails-provided modified Iceweasel.  The long format for the \"keyid\" means that the \"keyid\"  is shown with the initial 0x which can be useful if you are obtaining keys from an http based keyserver.

The keyid is a kind of nickname based on part of the fingerprint, which should be unique to each key and can be used by Gpg to distinguish between the keys in your keyring.  So for example when you use Gpg commands to examine which keys have signed some key, such as the current tails-signing-key, you can refer to that key by its keyid.
