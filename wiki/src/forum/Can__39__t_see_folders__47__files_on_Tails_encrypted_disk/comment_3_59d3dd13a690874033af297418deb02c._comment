Thank you for your comments, I will report this bug. 

And this is indeed strange. I have restarted Tails and I still can't see the files in the file browser. Are there more solutions for this? In which other OS I can try to retrieve the files. It must be an OS that can read the Tails encrypted disk, because usually the disk can only be read in Tails.
