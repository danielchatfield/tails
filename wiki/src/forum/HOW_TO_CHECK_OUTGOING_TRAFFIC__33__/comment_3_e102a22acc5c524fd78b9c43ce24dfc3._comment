Regarding point 2 and 3:

I posted this before in another thread but the way vidalia builds circuits in tails is disturbing. I was looking at the network map and every circuit was using the same US entry node, even after destroying them and building new ones. Most circuits were using two nodes from the same country (US - GB - US etc).

Something like Advanced Onion Router would be very good for tails (you could even store your router blacklist in the encrypted partition if you get paranoid and ban every router from countries that aggressively share information with each other)

And wireshark is fantastic for seeing where your traffic is going and monitoring everything else that is hitting/leaving your network card.
