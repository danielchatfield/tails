> Which version of of Tails has tcpdump, 0.12.1 or 13...? I can't find it in 0.12.1.

It's been in every Tails release since version 0.6 or something like that. It's located in `/usr/sbin`, so it's not `amnesia`'s `$PATH`. Dumping your network traffic with `tcpdump` requires root privileges, so use `sudo tcpdump ...`, like describe above.
