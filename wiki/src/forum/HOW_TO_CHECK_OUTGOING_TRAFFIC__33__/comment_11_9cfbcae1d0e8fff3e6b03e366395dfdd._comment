<i>\"They compel the users to verify their profiles with cellphone numbers\"</i>

yeah, i think this is true.  i tried to setup an facebook account with yahoo mail a few weeks ago and about 30 minutes after i logged in and made a single post, i get message from facebook that they need a phone number to verify my acct so i said \"no thanks\"

iirc facebook is now using hardware fingerprinting techniques as well, so beware.

i have resorted to viewing facebook pages i need to see through Anonymouse.org (when not on the TAILS CD) but i'm not sure how much protection that affords.
