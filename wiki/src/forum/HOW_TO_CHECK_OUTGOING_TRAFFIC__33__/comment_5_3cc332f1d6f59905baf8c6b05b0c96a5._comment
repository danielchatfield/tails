> how to **add package (example: wireshark) with Synaptic Package Manager ?**

Did you update the package list before trying to install new packages ?

**In Synaptics**, use Ctrl + R to update the package list, then check the packages

**With command lines**, as root : *apt-get update && apt-get install wireshark*
