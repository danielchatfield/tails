>Using Facebook is dangerous. It plants too many cookies, web bugs and tracking software when you are surfing.

Um, duh! That's *the point* of using a live anonymising distro like Tails to access it - and *that's* (probably*) the reason facebook are blocking Tor. A sort of \"privicy arms race\" so to speak.

\* Their recent outright hostility towards users who connect via Tor could also be because various lazy policing agencies have been enjoying using facebook/google and their ilk as convenient tracking honeypots... The only way they'll give up that nice little gift is after *requiring* facebook/google to forensically tie your account to the GPS tracking device you carry in your pocket. 

No IP address eh? Fine. Just give us your ICBM co-ordinates bitches.
