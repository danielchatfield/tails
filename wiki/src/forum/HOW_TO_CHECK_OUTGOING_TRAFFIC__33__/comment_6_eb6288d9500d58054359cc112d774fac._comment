Since installing Wireshark everytime you want to do this is time consuming I suggest using `tcpdump`, which already is installed in Tails, instead:

    sudo tcpdump -i any -w tails.dump

You can stop the packet capture by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal you executed the above command in. After that you copy the `tails.dump` file to your own system and open it in Wireshark.
