Getting a bit off topic so I keep it brief.

* Reconsider the use of MSN / Yahoo chat. They use \"open\" udp protocols, and may attempt to make a person-to-person connection in some cases. Tails pidgin offers secure end-to-end encryption over some protocols.
* You might assign a \"secure communication officer\" in your organization. He will teach the volunteers how to securely exchange information.
* Consider assigning a \"central facebook publisher\". He will safely exchange information with your vollunteers and publish it on Facebook from your secure HQ. Your volunteers should never be at risk by trying to publish Facebook information if they are not properly trained.
* Tails has evolved to be as secure as possible. It comes at a price: harder to use, limited communication options. You might evaluate which information is sensitive enough so it has to be send with Tails.

About Facebook ip.

** !! Insecure !!: **  You can set 1 Tails endnode to access Facebook. A trusted friend perhaps which will be your private endnode?
