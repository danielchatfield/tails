Hi, thanks for reporting this issue.

Apparently the bug is already known to The Tor Project, see <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1779>.

But doesn't seems to be known to the Polipo developers, see <http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/polipo/bugs.text>.

I guess we should report it back to Polipo. I will keep you updated.
