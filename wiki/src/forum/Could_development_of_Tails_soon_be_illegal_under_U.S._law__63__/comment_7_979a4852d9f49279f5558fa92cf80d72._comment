Whoudathunkit?  Keith Alexander visits North Korea?  OK, that is not really true (as far as I know), but how about Eric Schmidt?

Would it be unacceptably obstreperous to speculate upon the possibility that Google, having thorougly \"captured\" the U.S. government, now wants to acquire a new and maximally unlikely client government in the Hermit Kingdom?

Another topic to look for in the news: continuing repercussions of the CIA plot to use a fake vaccination campaign (using *fake vaccines*, even; how nasty is that?)  targeting the children of the late Mr. Bin Laden, which has led to universal condemnation from genuine human rights and medical aid organizations, and also to at least a dozen tragic assasinations in Pakistan of local aid workers who were trying to distribute much needed polio and hepatitis vaccines.  This is what happens when nations grant their secret police too much power.
