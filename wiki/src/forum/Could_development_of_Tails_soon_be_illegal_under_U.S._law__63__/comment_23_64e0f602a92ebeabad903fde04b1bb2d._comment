A tragedy which occurred on Friday (the 11th of January, 2013) appears to underscore the warning not to ignore potential legal threats to Tor developers (and other freedom loving coders).  

There are far too few developers who are brave enough to work in the area of privacy-promoting tools as it is.  We in the community need to do whatever we reasonably can to protect the few who exist against all threats.  Right now I don't know how to do this effectively, but I hope that those of us who recognize the gravity of the situation can find appropriate venues to discuss the problem of ensuring the survival of the most essential members of our community, the developers.
