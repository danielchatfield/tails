@7: An *acronym* is when the initials form a pronounceable *word*. 

An example would be \"SCOTUS\", which is formed by the initials for Supreme Court of the United States and is pronounced *sko-tuss*)

The example I gave, *CIA*, is an *initialism*, as it does not form a word but rather each letter is pronounced separately. 

@#8: Other than #6 and this one, #5 was my only comment in this thread.
