You're an American, correct? Try to think outside your box.

So how can Tor hope to survive in such a hostile environment? By <strike>political astuteness, as well as</strike> further technical improvements aimed at thwarting the most dangerous attacks (which entails modifying the threat model to adapt to a rapidly changing political/legal/technical real-world threat environment). i.e. Just as has always been the case.

Tails/Tor aren't \"pressure groups\" or \"lobbys\", they are software projects. If **you** want to change **your** government, then that's **your** perogative/responsibility. Tails/Tor might even offer useful tools for **your** political endeavours... that's pretty much one of their primary purposes... but it's a bit much to expect those projects to *do **your** job for **you** *!
