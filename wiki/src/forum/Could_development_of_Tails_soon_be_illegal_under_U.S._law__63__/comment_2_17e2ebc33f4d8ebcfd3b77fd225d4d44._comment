Well, there is much truth in that, but it doesn't really negate the fear I tried to express.

If we could only be allowed to discuss such issues, I think it would emerge that there is in fact much common ground.  But these issues are very complicated to explain and discuss, so when discussions are cut short, the mistaken impression can be left that participants are simply talking past one another, when in fact if they had been allowed to continue, concensus might have emerged.
