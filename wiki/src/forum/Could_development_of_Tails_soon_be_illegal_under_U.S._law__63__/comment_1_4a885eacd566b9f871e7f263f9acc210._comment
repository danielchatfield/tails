At the danger of engaging in a fruitless conversation with conspiracy nuts: Jake is hounded because of his involvement in WikiLeaks, not Tor. Tor and similar projects are actually supported by US government, because they are one of many ways to uphold subversive movements in various countries (mainly ME and Asia). E.g., BBG (ex-CIA propaganda arm) -> RFA -> OTF is one such channel that results in ridiculous sums of money thrown at anonymity-related projects, including amateur stuff like CryptoCat.
