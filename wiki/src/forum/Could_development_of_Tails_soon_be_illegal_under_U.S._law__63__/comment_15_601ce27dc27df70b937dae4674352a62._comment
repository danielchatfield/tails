Some of us are concerned that the developers of tools like Tor and Tails ignore at our peril legal precedents which could shut down their projects.  We are not suggesting that they cease development of Tor/Tails or that users cease using Tor/Tails, rather that the Tor/Tails communities need to keep an eye on these developments, and if possible, lobby to decrease the chances of bad laws being enacted, or bad precedents being set.
