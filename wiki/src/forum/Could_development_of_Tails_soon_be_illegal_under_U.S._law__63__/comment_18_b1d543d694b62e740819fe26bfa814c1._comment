Working on it, but this has been difficult.

In general, while I realize there are many demands on developer time, and see many good things on your todo list, I think that the Tails developer team (and indeed the Tor developer team) need to avoid focusing on technical issues to the exclusion of all others.  Because I think that could ultimately lead to Tails becoming irrelevant/useless for legal reasons, or due to threats not in the threat model.
