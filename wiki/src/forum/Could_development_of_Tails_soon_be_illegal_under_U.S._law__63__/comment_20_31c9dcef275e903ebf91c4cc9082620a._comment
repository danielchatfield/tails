Permitting the continued existence of Tor (and Tails by extension) is by its very nature a political decision made by the most powerful and lethal government in history.  

So how can Tor hope to survive in such a hostile environment?  By political astuteness, as well as further technical improvements aimed at thwarting the most dangerous attacks (which entails modifying the threat model to adapt to a rapidly changing political/legal/technical real-world threat environment).

As has often been mentioned in this forum, there appears to be some truth to the suggestion that in the ongoing struggle inside the U.S. government between those who want to eliminate Tor and those who want to support it, a politically valuable *ally* of Tor may include... the U.S. Navy Seals.  They're not as \"golden\" as they were before the recent scandal about leaks from active duty Seals, but their help could still be useful.  Also, even within single agencies which are generally anti-anonymity, such as the FBI, one can sometimes find people who understand why \"backdoors\" is inconsistent with computer security for all... which is the real problem with genuine (not police-manufactured) cybercrime, not anonymity.  The idea is to encourage the people who \"get it\" to speak up during those conference calls.
