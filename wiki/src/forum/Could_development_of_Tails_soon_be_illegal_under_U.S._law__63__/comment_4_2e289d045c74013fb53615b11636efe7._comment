Early in 2011, some of us tried to warn about an internal struggle inside the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which was unforunately won by the bad guys.  Recent news stories have revealed some details.  From a story by Julia Angwin of the Wall Street Journal:

> Top U.S. intelligence officials gathered in the White House Situation Room in March to debate a controversial proposal. Counterterrorism officials wanted to create a government dragnet, sweeping up millions of records about U.S. citizensâ€”even people suspected of no crime.

> Not everyone was on board. \"This is a sea change in the way that the government interacts with the general public,\" Mary Ellen Callahan, chief privacy officer of the Department of Homeland Security, argued in the meeting, according to people familiar with the discussions.

> A week later, the attorney general signed the changes into effect.

Regarding *\"even people suspected of no crime\"*, keep an eye out for future stories in major news outlets which will reveal how the current U.S. President has allegedly adopted the dangerous pseudoscience of \"precrime\" and \"preventative detention\".  This is an idea which the FBI and other secret police agencies have been secretly urging on U.S. Presidents since the Clinton administration.  Tragically, it appears to have now been enshrined as a core policy of the U.S. government.
