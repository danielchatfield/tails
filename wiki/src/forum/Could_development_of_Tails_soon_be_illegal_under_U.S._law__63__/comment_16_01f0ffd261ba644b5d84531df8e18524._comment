I think we can all safely ignore that bridge if and when they ever bother to erect it.

In the meantime, I'm inclined to think that a handful of Tails devs lobbying against NSA, CIA, RIAA, etc., would have no effect other than to get said devs onto (more?) unhelpful \"lists\"

This whole thread REALLY is completely pointless!
