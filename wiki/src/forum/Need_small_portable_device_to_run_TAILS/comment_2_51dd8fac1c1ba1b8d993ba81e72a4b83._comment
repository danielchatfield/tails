get a popular netbook, check the wireless chipset for compatibilty beforehand though. You can even try taking a live debian distro to a store and asking them if you can check the hardware compatibilty. Also, look for netbooks with specific linux distros already created for them.

Anything smaller than a netbook is likely based on arm architecture and won't be compatible with tails. I think some intel based tablets might be released this year though.
