I think I found a better solution for you. Start Iceweasel with these paremeters*:
-no-remote -P

This will take to to the profile manager. Now create as many profiles as you need. Just give each a name and don't change anything else. You can launch one now. Now start Iceweasel with those paremeters again, and launch another profile. (Be patient it may take a little while to start.) You should now have two Iceweasel windows that keep their sessions separate. 

I only gave it a really quick stest, but it seems to work.

*One easy way to do this is to right-click Iceweasel in the Applications menu \"Add this launcher to desktop\", then right-click the new launcher on the desktop, open to properties and change the command to:
iceweasel -no-remote -P

If you've enabled persistance, you can move this launcher to your persistant folder for later convenience. You'll still need to recreate the profiles each time, but it's quicker than it sounds, just a few clicks.
