Thanks you very much it was rather useful to read , but my problem is just to have possibility , to use 2 or more accounts on one site at the same time . On windows I usually had different browser for different accounts. But here I am worried if browsing by another browser chromium for example installed by synaptic can be dangerous . I trust iceweasel couse devs put it in tails . So question is will chromium take proper settings in tails and be as safe as iceweasel
