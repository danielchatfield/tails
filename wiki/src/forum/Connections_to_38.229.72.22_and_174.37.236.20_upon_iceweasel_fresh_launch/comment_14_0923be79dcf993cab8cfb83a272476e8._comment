@ Comment 9:

You asked for a reference for this:

> Yes, that's the server which offers the \"Tor check\" page. A valuable service, but I worry about the fact that it is apparently operated by Cymru Research

Using reverse lookup, BGP, etc. you can determine that the Tor nodes

      IP                name                            bandwidth (KB/sec)
      38.229.70.51	torproxy04.teamcymru.net	12657
      38.229.70.54	torproxy07.teamcymru.net	12484
      38.229.70.61	torproxy09.teamcymru.net	11660
      38.229.79.2	torproxy10.teamcymru.net	11497
      38.229.70.53	torproxy06.teamcymru.net	11457
      38.229.70.52	torproxy05.teamcymru.net	9690
      38.229.70.33	torproxy02.teamcymru.net	3682
      38.229.70.42	torproxy03.teamcymru.net	1941
      38.229.70.42	torproxy03.teamcymru.net	1840

are indeed in IP ranges belonging to Cymru Research.  As of a few years ago, their own web pages contained the statement that their business is \"researching on-line criminal behavior\" (not an exact quote), and the apparent link with the former General Counsel of \"Team Themis\".

In case anyone cares, 

* \"Cymru\" means \"Welsh\" in the Welsh language
* it seems the founder of the company is of Welsh extraction
* in some communities, \"to welsh\" means \"to snitch\"
