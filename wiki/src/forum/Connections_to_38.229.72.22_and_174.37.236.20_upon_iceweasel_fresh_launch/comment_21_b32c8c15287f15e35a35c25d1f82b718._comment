Needing a centralized check.torproject.org page was a big sign of incompetence in the first place. A page to which every user for their anonymity network connects to on every start of the browser. What a waste of money for hosting is that? Years later they are still working on a local browser homepage to replace this mess. Its not like they dont get millions of sponsoring every year.
