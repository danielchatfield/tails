OP here

Thanks all for feedback.

Yes, I use bridges (but none matches 174.37.236.20) and running from live cd - Tails latest release.

I tried to launch iceweasel again and again to notice changes in those suspicious connections. here are my findings:

A bunch of other IP's came up, 1 new ip each iceweasel launch time, in addition to check.torproject.org (which I suppose is resolution of 38.229.72.22 but not sure)

The ip's/conections are as follows (results obtained from tor network map):

5.63.145.124:80  1st launch

146.185.29.170:80 - 2nd launch

ocsp.digicert.com - 3rd launch

Notice: the suspicious connection **always** uses a separate circuit from the one which 38.229.72.22 is using

38.229.72.22 remains the same and opens each time, but as mentioned, it comes on a separate Tor circuit
