Addons can do anything within Iceweasel, and this leaves many venues for stuff to go wrong even with our transparent proxy that makes everything go through Tor:

1. They can be maliciously \"trapped\" with phone home type of leaks. E.g. grabbing your real system IP address, and sending it + your browsing history to $EVIL_ENTITY every minute or whatever. It will be sent to Tor, but with your real IP address attached.
2. They can phone home about sites you visit in intended, non-malicious ways, e.g. StumbleUpon and others.
3. They can have bugs opening up the browser for remote exploits, e.g. like point 1.
4. They can have bugs breaking other addons, e.g. Torbutton, which would seriously hurt your anonymity.
5. They can alter your HTTP headers/traffic flow/browser behaviour/whatever in ways that are easily identifiable from the outside (exit node/destination site/whatever), thus making you distinguishable from other Tails and Tor users, which is terrible for anonymity.
