All that, and I forgot to answer the question you asked.

I was actually trying to suggest

* checking the effect of single browser actions which might add to DOM storage files
* checking the effect of \"clear cookies\", \"clear cache\", browser restart, system reboot

The *worst* case would be always seeing DOM storage files which always increase, but never decrease in size, not even after a system reboot.  The *best* case would be seeing that your browser never sticks anything in DOM storage at all, as inferred from unchanging file sizes.
