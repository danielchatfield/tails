It's a very fundamental assumption of Tails to force all outgoing traffic to anonymity networks such as Tor. I don't think we want to provide ways of going around this since it would possibly compromise the security of all Tails users.

If you want to use OpenVPN with a live distro and without Tor I bet you can use any Debian or Ubuntu derivative and install OpenVPN from it.
