I just registered an account, which worked. I also got automatically logged in to it. After logging out I had no problem logging back in, but I can confirm this bug when trying to log in after also restarting the browser.

It seems to be an issue with NoScript since the following workaround works: NoScript preferences -> \"Advanced\" tab -> \"HTTPS\" tab -> \"Cookies\" tab: uncheck \"Automatic secure cookie management\". Note that this settings will be reset on browser restart.
