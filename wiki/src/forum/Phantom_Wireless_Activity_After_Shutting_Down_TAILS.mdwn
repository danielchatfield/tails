Hi,

Recently, after having run TAILS for a while and then shutting it down completely, I noticed that the lights on my router --both "internet" as well as "wireless"-- were still flashing. I was certain that I had no devices connected or attempting to connect to my router at that point. (I have no other router and no network hubs, switches, access points or anything else of the sort)

Finally, after several minutes of the flashing continuing without pause, I simply turned the router off. When I turned it on again later, it appeared back to normal. 

Does this mean that someone was at least trying to attack my router/ crack my WPA2 wireless? Is there any other possible explanation?

Thanks for any help.
