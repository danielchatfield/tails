You're supposed to memorize the number of replies to each thread. If you're too stupid to remember a simple list, then you're supposed to write them down. Use a pencil, not a pen, that whay you can keep your list updated without having to write it all out over and over again.

I you're too stupid to write a list, you probably shouldn't be using a computer.
