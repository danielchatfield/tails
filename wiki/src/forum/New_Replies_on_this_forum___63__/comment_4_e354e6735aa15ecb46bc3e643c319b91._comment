@Comment 2:

No, they don't, the order of posts never changes. Neither do new comments alter the \"Updated\" time, which always remains identical to the \"Started\" time. Been at the Airfix(TM) glue again?

@OP:

Perhaps you should open a bug...
https://tails.boum.org/bugs/
or wishlist item...
https://tails.boum.org/todo/#index11h1
...I notice there's already an \"Improve the forum\" entry...
https://tails.boum.org/todo/improve_the_forum/
..prehaps this should be a new section in there?
