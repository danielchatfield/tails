Please take this as constructive criticism.

Let me additionally point-out that is also no mention of filling the media with (psuedo-)random data prior to creating the encrypted volume. This is said to considerably increase the strength of the encyrption.

(There is a `badblocks` command that is said to be considered adequate when `/dev/urandom` would be too slow. I had thought that one pass of the \"PRNG stream\" method in DBAN would also be acceptable but then I realized that this may fill with zeros after filling with pseudo-random data. Presumably, that would take us right back where we began: A new or zeroed-out drive...)
