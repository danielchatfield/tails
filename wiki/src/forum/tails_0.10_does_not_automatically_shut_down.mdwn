After I click the red power button icon to shut down tails, it goes through all the shutdown operations. They all are marked as successful. I pull out my usb drive, but the the display does not shut off. Windows 7 often fails to start after I manually shutdown the computer when tails fails to.

Does this always mean that the memory wiping failed? Could it of still be paritally successful? Tails does not always fail to shutdown like it should.
