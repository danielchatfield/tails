@ OP: you're not doing it right.  You are supposed to keep the browser running but right click on the onion icon in the gnome task bar at top of your screen, which opens a pulldown menu, then left click on \"New Identity\".  That sends a special signal which ensures that you get a new circuit (specifically, at least the Exit node will be new).

Shutting down the browser instead of left clicking on \"Exit\" could possibly have some bad effects, but left clicking on \"Exit\" should cause the Vidalia controller to shut down the browser gracefully.
