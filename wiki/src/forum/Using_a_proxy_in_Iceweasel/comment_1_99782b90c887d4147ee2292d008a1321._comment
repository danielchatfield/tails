First of all, Tails uses the FoxyProxy Iceweasel extension for dealing with proxies, so don't use the Iceweasel proxy preferences. Second, see [[the design page for our firewall configuration|contribute/design/Tor_enforcement/Network_filter]]; in short, what you want to do is not supported, and will be blocked (except if the proxy is located on the LAN).
