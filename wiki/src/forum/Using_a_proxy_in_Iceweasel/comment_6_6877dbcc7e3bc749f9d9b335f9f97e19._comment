Hey Jake,
these are interesting news. I suggested to keep the alternative firewall setting in TAILS, that does not block any unknown traffic but routing it through TOR instead, in an earlier post in this forum. But I didn't realize this myself and the TAILS team did not like my idea. I will test the proxy settings in Iceweasel with the old version TAILS 0.9 today.

I have another question: Could you provide me your patch? Would be keen on having an updated TAILS for my proxyfication needs ;-)

Thanks,
ILikeTAILS
