Hey I#m not the creator of this thread but I reconfigured my firewall settings as in Tail 0.0.9. I use a patched version of 0.17. And hey - the proxy settings are not blocked.
But I would like to know what Tails does in this case, too. It should create the connection to the not-in-lan-proxy through TOR. Or not? 
Although this should not be the standard use case this is an interesting technical question!
