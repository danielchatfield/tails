I'm interested to know why there is a need for RAM wipe on shutdown. I thought that after a computer is powered down, the RAM loses its ability to store information?

Presumably there is a legitimate reason, so how effective is this Tails RAM wipe? I mean, is it just theoretically wiping RAM, or has it been forensically tested?

Also, does the fact that Tails is wiping the RAM reveal to any examiner that you have been using TAILS on your system?

Cheers.
