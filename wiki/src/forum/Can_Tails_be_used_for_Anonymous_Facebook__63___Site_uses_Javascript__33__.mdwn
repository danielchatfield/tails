Would like to setup a Facebook page anonymously in support of a cause but the site uses Javascript for many of its features! I am under the impression that ANY javascript use on any website while connected to Tor would reveal my real IP to the server, thus losing my anonymity. Is this true? Can Tails solve this problem? Does Tails protect my real IP even if I use a website with Javascript?

If not, what would be a solution for this problem (keeping Anonymity while using websites with javascript)?
