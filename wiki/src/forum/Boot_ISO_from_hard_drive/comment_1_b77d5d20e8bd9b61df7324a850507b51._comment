...the most up-to-date information I can find is in [this thread](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Encrypted_Usb_Tails_/). There's another good related but older thread [here](https://tails.boum.org/forum/LiveUSB__44___fromiso__61____42____44___GRUB2_and___39__wipe_memory__39___feature/). The instructions in the archived HowTo are obsolete and best ignored ;-)
