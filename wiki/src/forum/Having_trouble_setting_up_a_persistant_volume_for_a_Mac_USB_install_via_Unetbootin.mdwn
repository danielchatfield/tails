I created a bootable copy of tails using Unetbootin for my macbook. (If I use the Tails USB installer I can't get anything to boot, I assume it's something to do with the different volume formatting needed for my mac)

However, when I load up Tails and try to setup a persistant volume, it fails with a message like 'This was not created using the Tails USB installer'. 

Does anyone know of way to achieve this?
