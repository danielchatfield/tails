@ OP

Thanks for the recommendation but that utility you described is a command-line tool.

Why not use \"Checksum For Windows\"? It has a simple GUI and can compute SHA356 hashes. Tails only provides SHA256 hash for its download.

\"Checksum For Windows\" is open source and can be downloaded by clicking the following link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/checksumwindows/
