Unfortunately building Tails depends not only on the sources but on the state of the Debian APT repositories, so building from the same source today can yield a different result than building from them tomorrow if a Debian package was updated. That means that inconsistencies like the one you experience sometimes hit you.

Which branch are you trying to build? In general the `devel` branch is the one that gets the most love w.r.t. being buildable, so I suggest you use that one:

    git checkout devel
