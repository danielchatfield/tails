sure it's possible. 
sudo apt-get install xchat

without a persistent volume, you'd need to find and backup your profile / config files and put them into place on every boot.. or manually enter them each time.

I'd really encourage you to use Pidgin. It ships with Tails, works well with IRC, and you could save your settings with a Persistent volume.
