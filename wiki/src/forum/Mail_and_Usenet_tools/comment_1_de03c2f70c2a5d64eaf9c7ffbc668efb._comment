1. I fail to understand what kind of SMTP operation you're trying to do, how, how it fails, what kind of support you are expecting from Tails.

2. Mixmaster: why not; can you please try installing it inside of Tails (using the Synaptics package manager or `apt-get`) and tell us if it works properly? In any case, can you please [[create a new todo page|todo]] about this, where research results could be summed up more comfortably?

3. News reader: why not adding a tiny one; please [[create a new todo page|todo]] about this, where research results could be summed up more comfortably. Comparing a bit the two options you've mentionned would be a good start. Other than than, why would stunnel be needed?
