Hi everyone,

I've tried to launch tails from usb and dvd.
when i launch it from usb on dvd, i get to the language selection screen and choose language, then a whole bunch of lines appear and suddenly with no error messages, i'm stuck to a black screen with only a NON_flashing underscore, the CD stops running and thats it.

I have checked the iso with ffox plugin and suceed to launch it on a vbox so i guess it should work from the dvd/usb.

I do have browsed the forum but didnt get any working answers, plus no one's answering on #tails.

Thanks if you can help
