The Tor devs appear to have their e-penises tied in a knot for several years over whether and how to launch and maintain a forum.

Liberte Linux has a forum but when I view it through Tor, it's always blank with no entries - useless!

While the Tails forum may not use the best forum software available, it works.

Thank you.
