Another point while I think of it:  bigger Flash drives wear out slower than small thumb drives usually.  Get a big chunky thumbdrive, the bigger the better, and get a good quality brand.  El cheapo brand X flash drives are hit and miss.

Avoid Sandisk flash drives (which can turn up rebranded as some unknown cheapie brands), these have a bad rep afaik.
