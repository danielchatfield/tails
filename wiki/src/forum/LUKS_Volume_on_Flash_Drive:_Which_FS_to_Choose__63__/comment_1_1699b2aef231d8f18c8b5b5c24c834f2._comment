You'd probably get better and more knowledgable responses on a linux encryption list or a general linux forum (it's called google), but a factor to remember is that most cheap flash drives aren't so great and will wear out if subject to a lot of writes.  These have a technology called wear leveling which tries to slow down this wear electronically. That said, I've got an old usb stick that was used heavily and physically knocked around for 8 years, and it still works.  I wouldn't rely on it though.

Different filesystems involve different amounts of \"churning\" (moving stuff around and additional write activity for a journal) and are suited to different tasks.  To be honest, if you're just using this for ordinary types of use such as storing personal files, I'd just use ext4 and forget all about churning. The benefits of a journal for data preservation are a more important consideration.  The big plus of ext4 is it allows blindingly fast fsck'ing (filesystem check) so you can check it often quickly.   If the data is important, back it up to another encrypted drive. 

I doubt these filesystems were designed with Flash drives in mind.  There are other filesystems especially for Flash but you'll need to Google those.

If you need to also mount this drive in Windows under OTFE, then it's best to use a filesystem that both Linux and Windows understand eg fat32 but note you'll be limited as to file size (4GB max with fat32) and there's no journal.  Most linuxes do understand ntfs now provided ntfs-3g is installed. Having had corruption problems with ntfs-3g years ago I've always been a bit nervous about using it and avoid.

fat32 may be a slow choice compared with ntfs: http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/usb-flash-thumb-drive-ntfs-filesystem
