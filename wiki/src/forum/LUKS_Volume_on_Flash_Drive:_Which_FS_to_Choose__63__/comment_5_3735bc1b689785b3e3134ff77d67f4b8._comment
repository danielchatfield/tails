>why you felt it necessary to throw-in, \"it's called google\"-- a comment that comes across as nothing more than a petty, gratuitous barb.

Oh dear,  sorry.  Here in geekland the usual meme is \"Google is your friend\" and it gets thrown at newbies all the time.  It annoyed me the first time I received it as well some years ago, but I see it so often that I no longer find it patronizing.  

I'm not a Tails dev, I'm just a user like you, but I work in \"the industry\".   Fact is, finding the right answers on Google doesn't always work, but most often does, and I'd wager that Google searches are probably the #1 source of continuing education for professionals in the software industry.
