> I'm not the OP but after seeing this thread I had searched unsuccessfully for \"unsafe browser\" on the documentation index page and did not know where to go.

Looking for \"unsafe browser\" using the website search feature brings the right page as third result.

Also, I don't think \"unsafe browser\" means anything to most Tails users, contrary to the \"login to a captive portal\" usecase, which (how lucky) is the only one we want to advertise the unsafe browser for. For these reasons, I personally would disagree about changing the title of that page to include \"unsafe browser\".
