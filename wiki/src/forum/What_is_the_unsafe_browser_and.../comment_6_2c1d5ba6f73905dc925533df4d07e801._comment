>Read the documentation. 

Currently, on the documentation menu page ( https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.en.html )the hyperlinked heading for the section on the unsafe browser reads only, *\"Logging in to captive portals\"*. I urge you to add the words, \"TAILS unsafe browser\", in parentheses, to this header. 

I'm not the OP but after seeing this thread I had searched unsuccessfully for \"unsafe browser\" on the documentation index page and did not know where to go.
