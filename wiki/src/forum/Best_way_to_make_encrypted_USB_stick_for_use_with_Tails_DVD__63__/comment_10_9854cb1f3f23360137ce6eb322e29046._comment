I did use the stick to apparently create what might be a bootable USB with Tails, but I can't check because of my hardware limitations.  And apparently I need to be book from the USB stick (which I can't do) in order to proceed to making the persistent volume which is what I really need?

Is this making sense yet?  I hope so.
