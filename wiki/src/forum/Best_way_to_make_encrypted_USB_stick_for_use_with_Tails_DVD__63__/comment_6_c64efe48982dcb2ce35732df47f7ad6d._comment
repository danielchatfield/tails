@ \"Tails\":

What do you recommend to Tails users whose laptop cannot boot from Tails on a USB stick, and who are using Tails on a R/O DVD, for persistent strongly encrypted storage?   If the solution involves LUKS formatting of a USB stick (?) for use as an encrypted volume, please quote some shell commands because I can't understand from possibly relevant man pages how to proceed.

I did try to use the provided script to create a Tails on DVD, but since my computer can't boot from USB I don't know if it worked.
