>Is it true that SSD (sp?) devices can be risky because shred/wipe will not in fact \"securely delete\" a file? How about USB sticks?

Flash media (whether internal solid state drives or USB sticks) does indeed pose a problem with regard to secure erasure, i.e., overwriting.

Not only will overwriting a single *file* not work on flash media but even overwriting an *entire device* does not always work. The problem is wear-leveling. This is noted in the TAILS documentation in the section on secure erasure.

This limitation of solid-state/flash media *can* actually create a problem relevant for encryption as well.

>Due to security reasons, we recommend that TrueCrypt volumes are not created/stored on devices (or in file systems) that utilize a wear-leveling mechanism (and that TrueCrypt is not used to encrypt any portions of such devices or filesystems).
