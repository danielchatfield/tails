Yes, of course I read it, apologies if I failed to make that clear.

Let me try again to ask someone to address a feature of that documentation which might be one cause of my confusion. 

From
https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html

> In order to use Tails USB installer, you need to start Tails from another media, and clone it onto the USB stick that you want to install. You can either:
* Burn a Tails DVD (recommended).
* Use another Tails USB stick, version 0.11 or later, for example from a friend.
* Manually install Tails onto another USB stick, if you can't use a DVD.
> Using Tails USB installer allows you to later create a persistent volume in the free space left on the USB stick. This requires a USB stick of at least 2 GB.

All the documentation seems to assume that anyone trying to do something with a USB stick is putting a Tails installation on there in order to boot Tails from a USB stick (easier to carry than a DVD, I guess).  It left me confused (despite several readings and the obvious experiment of simply following instructions and trying to figure out if this had accomplished my goal) as to which if any instructions there are relevant to a Tails user who cannot boot Tails (or any other distribution) from a USB stick due to hardware limitations, but who wants to create a strongly encrypted persistent volume (did I say that right?) on a USB stick to use when booting Tails from a DVD on a laptop which has a CD/DVD reader and USB ports suitable for attaching USB sticks.
