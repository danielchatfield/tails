thank you all for your kind help, I am the creator of this post, to make things a little bit more clear I have created two usb sticks using tails usb instaler one has tails 0.16 the other 0.17, now tails 0.16 boots on all machines that I have, either from DVD or usb, tails 0.17 as a DVD also boots on all machines, as a usb it only boots on my desktop and my old laptop, on my eMachines 355 netbook does nothing at all as if it is not there, also I cant get to the bios if the usb is on the machine, also as I saw in the usb formating has left some a little unallocated space is it possible that the computer hits that space and cant find the OS? as for the machine it is an eMachines 355-N571G25 cpu N570 the users manual says that it's dual core but the system monitor shows that it is quad core, 1gb of ram, and again thank you all for your kind help
