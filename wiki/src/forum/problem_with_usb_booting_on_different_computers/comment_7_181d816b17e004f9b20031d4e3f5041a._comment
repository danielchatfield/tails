hi again I am the person that created this post, first I'd like to say that the problem I had, had nothing to do with tails, I did not have a problem with the bootloader or any part of tails, it was the usb stick that my netbook could not read for some reason, I simply upgraded the usb I had with tails 0.16 to tails 0.17 using tails usb installer and it works, thank you guys for your help and advise.
