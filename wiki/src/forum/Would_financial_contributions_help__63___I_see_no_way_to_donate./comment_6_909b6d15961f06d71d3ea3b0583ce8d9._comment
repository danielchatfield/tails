I started this thread.

I could care less where the money goes, as long as it first hits the hands of the guys responsible for this project.

I believe that tails simply uses TOR, and that TOR does not in any way provide financial support to tails.

Getting this going would be simple guys, just accept LR/WMZ/Bitcoin/WU/MG. You'll get a minimum in the low 4 figure range from my organization alone. USD.

Much appreciated. Thank you for what you do.
