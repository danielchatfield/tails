@Comment 6 and 7: I see no indication that TAILS needs any money at this point, much less the amounts you speak of. (Though perhaps with enough money TAILS could actually *hire* devs, etc.)

But if you have and are ready to donate that kind of money, I certainly hope that you will find a worthy and needy cause for it. (Lord knows there's no shortage of them...)
