I created account createdrandomaccount@tormail.net. How does that catch interest for a watering hole attack?

That fear is greatly exaggerated. A random newly created pseudonymous account just to ask some questions about anything on a mailinglist does not catch attention.

Why go after such a random user if you can catch the tails people and make them give up or add backdoor? This are dangers not your e-mail address watering hole attack.
