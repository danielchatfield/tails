I'm sorry, but this discussion is off-topic here: there's nothing specific to Tails, as compared to Tor, about creating an \"anonymous\" email address. I suggesting reading the archives of tor-talk, and posting specific questions there
to clarify whatever precise point that might not have been discussed already there in the past.
