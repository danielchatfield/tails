Eh?

Indeed... although as there are many suitable services, hosted in many different countries, such an approach is *unlikely* to be particularly successful. The *real* \"watering hole\" is, of course, *tails.boum.org* ;)

...still... probably better not to single out any particular service(s) for recommendation here for the reason you gave. It's certainly not difficult to investigate \"webmail providers\" and simply try a few for one's self... I managed it!... and found *several*... So, on balance, I agree that *risking* creating a \"watering hole\" just to \"help\" a handful of users who are too lazy to find one for themselves wouldn't really *help* anyone.

I suppose [someone could](https://tails.boum.org/contribute/index.en.html) compile and maintain a huge, regularly randomised, as-close-to-exhastive-as-possible list of suitable services. If the list was maintained to always provide a sufficiently large and diverse selection it might be useful to some.
