You can always create a fake hotmail or gmail account but at the end of the day, it can be traced back to the computer you send it from, unless, maybe you connect through a proxy server. Try using one of the many websites out there what you can send anonymous email from. Silentsender.com is a good, I used it once and had no problems and it can't be traced back to you.
