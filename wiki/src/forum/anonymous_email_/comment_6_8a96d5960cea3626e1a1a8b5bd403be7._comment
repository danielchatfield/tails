@ \"Tails\":

Catch-22!

@ the poster who is 100% convinced anonymous email is easy:

Please post to Tor-talk a clear and detailed description of how you accomplish this in order to post to Tor-talk as a frequent poster.  I'm sure I'll see it and study it if you do.  Sound good to you?

I actually agree with you about boum.org as a likely target, and that's one of the most important reasons why IMO the Tails Project should avoid forum software which prevents unregistered users from posting.  If no boum.org server keeps the data, no-one can steal or seize it from boum.org.
