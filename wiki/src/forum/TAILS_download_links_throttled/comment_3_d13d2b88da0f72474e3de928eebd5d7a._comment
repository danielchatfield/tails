Sorry. AFAIK, Tor doesn't allow downloads over 64MB per file. It's a technical limitation of one of the pieces of software that TAILS uses. Looks like it's not fixable that soon, but I may be wrong.

DO NOT be tempted to download through BitTorrent over Tor. It harms the network and can even expose (de-anonymize) you or at least raise some red flags.
