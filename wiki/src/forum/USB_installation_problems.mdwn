Hi, first time user here. Running windows 7 on a dell optiplex 755.

I've successfully downloaded, verified, and installed tails on my USB stick. When I restart and try to boot from the USB, I just get "Error: Selected Device not available"

I've tried this with 2 different USB sticks, and both have had the same problem.
