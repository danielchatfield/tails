I never did before update or upgrade of USB tails, now here is 0.12 and I don't want to loose persistence folder. so, I think I need one dvd and 2 usb, I have all of it. 

so, can I do like this, to upgrade and keep untouched persistence folder:

1.burn tails iso to DVD, 

2.boot tails 0.12 from DVD and choose Applications - Tails - Tails USB installer to start Tails USB installer. Choose Upgrade from ISO.

3.Plug the USB stick

4.Choose the USB stick from the Target Device drop-down list.

5.Click on the Browse button to specify the location of the ISO image.

is this correct process to keep persistance folder untouched?

and number 5... I should choose/browse tails 0.12 iso but if I burnt it to DVD and boot from DVD, I can't choose DVD than I must copy earlier iso image in some other USB, therefore I think I need 2 usb devices, one to copy iso file and one to be upgraded.

so, shortly: download and burn iso to dvd, then copy iso to usb, then do the process from above on usb which should be upgraded. it means one dvd and 2 usb devices.
