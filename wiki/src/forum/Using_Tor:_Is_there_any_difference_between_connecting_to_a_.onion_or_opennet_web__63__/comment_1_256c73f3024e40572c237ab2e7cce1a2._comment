On \"clearnet\"/\"open-net\" (i.e., regular .com, .org, .info, etc. sites) any traffic that doesn't go over SSL (http**s**) can be seen by the exit node. 

Supposedly, this is not the case for Tor hidden sites, i.e., sites that end with \".onion\", as they are claimed to be fully encrypted (in much the same way that SSL over clearnet is).
