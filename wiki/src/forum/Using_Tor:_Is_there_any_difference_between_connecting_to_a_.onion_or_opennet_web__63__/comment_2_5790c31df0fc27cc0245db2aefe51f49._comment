>Is it the same connecting to .onion and *.tor2web.fi?

I'm not familiar with tor2web.fi but if what it does is enable the viewing of .onion sites over clearnet, then as per what I wrote in comment 1 above...the exit node would be able to see the traffic.

Additionally, using such a site adds another point in the chain, thereby introducing potential threats.
