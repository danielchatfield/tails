-Start up Pidgin
-Click manage accounts and unlick/disable everything that tries to automatically run (i hate this.. why?? do not want to automatically connect to IRC and get a 'you are banned for spamming' message because of tor)
-Click Add account
-Choose XMPP from the dropdown list
-Fill out username (any name you want)
-Domain: use jabber.ccc.de or another jabber service
-Resource: put in anything you want, doesn't matter
-Password: put in desired password u want

Then at the bottom of page, click 'Create this new account on the server'

Now you have Jabber account. Your friend does the same, and when you are in chat window together click 'OTR' and choose 'Start private conversation'

Pidgin will automatically generate OTR keys and you can talk encrypted with each other.
