This may be a noobie question, is there a way to get all the webpages in english, rather than the default for your location?

Google is really pissing me off right now. So if anyone has an idea for a way around, it would make me very happy. Or if anyone knows of an alternative to google docs that would work in iceweasel and have some sort of encryption.

 Of course because I am using the tor network I appear to be logging in from a random and different locations every time I login to google accounts. The most recent time I logged into google I was prompted with a message that said I needed to enter city/state/country of where I usually login in from. Therefore, I cannot login to my account and I don't want to reset my password everytime I login.
cheers
