Hi,
    just wondering if it was possible to include a small radio app like RadioTray?

perhaps there are some security implications with this that would preclude most users from wanting a radio app but myself i'm just looking to avoid profiling data being compiled on me. i would like to use TAILS as my main OS and if it had a small radio player i think i could. 

any comments (positive or negative) are appreciated.
