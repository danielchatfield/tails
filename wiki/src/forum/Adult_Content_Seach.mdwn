Adult Content searches are apparently censored (filtered?) by the "Startpage Search Engine" and other search engines. How do you turn off this censorship?

In 1964, there was a PG Rated James Bond movie called Goldfinger. There was a character in the movie and book named Pussy Galore. It is now 2013 and apparently Tails 0.17 has censored any references to the movie and the word pussy.

I'm a 63 year old adult, how do I turn off the censorship?

Thanks
