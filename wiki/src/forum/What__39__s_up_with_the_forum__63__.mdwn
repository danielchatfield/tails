The "update time" of a great swathe (though not quite all) of threads has just been reset... resulting in their listing order being shuffled on the forum page. However there doesn't appear to be anything new in the the threads' histories to explain this.

Anyone know what's causing these phantom updates? Server fault perhaps? Looks like the same thing has happened before, on Fri 28 Oct 2011 06:37:55 PM CEST

Can anything be done to reverse this? Perhaps sorting the list by "Started" time rather than "Updated" as those data seem unaffected?


**Update:**
Happened again on Mon 10 Sep 2012 11:29:13 AM CEST accompanied by observable server failure. The sorting correction has also disappeared.
