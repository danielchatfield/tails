>Is the most likely explanation a successful attack on my router that had begun traffic at some point before I had killed wget ?

I think comment 1 nailed it. Maybe creating new circuits too.

From the info you've given I don't think its likely to have been anything else within Tails, so my next guess would be a neighbour \"having a go\" with Kismet, etc.

RE: Comment 3: Ironically, there's irony there whether you're right or wrong about OP!

There's no doubt that there's at least one \"troll\" visiting us lately but allowing it to create paranoia and animosity will only \"feed\" it. I'm certain the best way to deal with that problem is to completely ignore it.

Keep Calm and Carry On
