Each release of Firefox (and in the extend Iceweasel and Tor Browser) fixes multiple major security vulnerabilities that is exploited by adversaries, and releasing a new Firefox update only once a month means we may be vulnerable to known exploits that is actively used in the wild for up a month.

So, should be dump Firefox/Iceweasel too?

What I really meant to say is, why do people make such a big thing out of the Java vulnerabilities. I would say the Firefox ones is much worse, even if Tails would have had Java as a browser plugin (which it has not).
