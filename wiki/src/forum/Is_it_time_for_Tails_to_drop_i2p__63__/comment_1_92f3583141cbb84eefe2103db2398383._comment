OP, I don't trust Java, either. Especially since I read that Java may not be really fixed for two years, if ever. Doesn't sound like anything someone who really needs security should be relying on to me.

P.S. The Tails devs have said on this forum that Tails security does not depend on the router. I am hoping that means the security can remain intact even if the router is rooted. I almost expect it, actually, with the amount of spying our adversaries are into.
