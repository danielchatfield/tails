The problems OP is describing are related to Java **applets**, **not** normal Java.
If the Java does not run in your browser, it is not vulnerable to any of the recent hype. 
Applets are becoming increasingly rare nowadays anyway.
If you are describing problems with ALL Java, may I remind you that it's very easy to write insecure C too? If not easier? ;-)
