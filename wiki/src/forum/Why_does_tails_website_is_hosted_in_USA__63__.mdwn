Hi

I agree that riseup folks are nice, but why does tails is hosted in the US? 

I mean they have the Patriot Act, and even if the US allow 'no logging' the patriot act makes it so that you have to spy on your users if needed...

Couldn't tails dev have to add a backdoor if asked by the FBI because of the site being based in the USA? 

Well, one might say that if asked they might just move away from that weird country.. but theoretically when asked something in the patriot act context you have to keep it secret and to obey... isn't it?

Anyway, thanks for the good work :)
