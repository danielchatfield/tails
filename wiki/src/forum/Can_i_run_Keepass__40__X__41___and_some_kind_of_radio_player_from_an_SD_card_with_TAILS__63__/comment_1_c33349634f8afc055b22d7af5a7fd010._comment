Certainly nothing wrong with this in principle. I keep several .deb packages and home-compiled binaries on flash medium, along with a Tails specific installation & configuration script to set them up. Various other tools, keys, validation and verification scripts and whatnot live there too. All safely housed in a Truecrypt container. Makes everything quick and convenient, even when working offline. Just keep an eye out for security updates to any internet facing apps.

Can't help you with any radio specific apps though - just not my thing.
