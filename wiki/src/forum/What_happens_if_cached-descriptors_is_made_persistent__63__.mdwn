From the "persistence preset" page:

>Custom scripts relying on non-persistence

>Some of our scripts depend on that certain files in /var/lib/tor are not persistent, which has to be resolved before adding the preset:

    >Our time syncing script uses the existence of cached-descriptors as a test for wheter Tor is working, and a similar assumption is made for the *-consensus files.

What happens if this is made persistent? Will this cause tor or tails to fail?
