It should be noted, though, that the MAC address only \"earmarks\" you packets in the first hop in the network -- the MAC address of an ethernet packet is changed for each hop it makes, which kinda means for each network router it goes through, which usually are 10+. (Just to be clear: your MAC address will *not* earmark packets \"out on the internet\".) Hence, the only relevance of hiding your MAC address is if you connect to a network out of your control, that cannot be linked to you and that you do not trust.

What can be done with MAC addresses? There are two main things:

1. An adversary can see how many times and when a certain NIC has connected to the network. 
2. An adversary *may* be able to track down the owner of the NIC with a specific MAC address by asking for sales records from the manufacturer, and then the billing information from the retail store/whatever that sold it. I'm unsure of how doable this really is in practice, but that's the theory.

Relevance of chaning MAC address:

1. To change your MAC address while using your home internet connection is pretty much pointless as your ISP will still know that the connection originates from your home and thus can be tied to your person. Perhaps it could grant you some plausible deniability if you say that: \"See, the MAC addressed used wasn't mine, so surely someone broke into my home/hacked into my wireless network and used Tails to commit the crime (or whatever that brought you attention)\". Of course, it they then can prove that you are or have been in possession of Tails (did you download it from your home? do you have Tails CDs lying around at home?), that defense might be shaky at best.
2. To change your MAC address when connecting to an open wireless network (or otherwise public network) could be relevant if you some how screw up, Tor is broken or something else that reveals your IP address to your adversaries so they can track down which network was used. In that scenario your adversaries could demand logs of MAC addresses, but they won't be able to find your real NIC, but they will know that you physically was there which tells them a number of things...
