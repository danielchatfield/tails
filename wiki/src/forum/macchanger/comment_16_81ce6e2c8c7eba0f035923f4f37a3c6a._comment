Agree with that in general. On tails dev there is some interesting post about machiato which you probably saw. Hopefully the devs will use it to improve the machanger situation on a near tails version.
Just a detail... even when you feel strongly about something consider using \"should\" or \"really should\" instead of \"must\" :) much nicer to read and actually more likely to get your point across ;)
