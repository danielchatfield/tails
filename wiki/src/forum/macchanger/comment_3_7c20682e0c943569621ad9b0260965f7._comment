Installing macchanger-gtk would make end-users think all they need to protect themselves against such threats is to change their mac address once booted. This is unfortunately fully wrong as the mac address will have been leaked already.

The [[macchanger todo item|todo/macchanger]] explains why it's not as simple as \"but why the hell don't you install macchanger(-gtk)?\" Help to solve this todo item is fully welcome.
