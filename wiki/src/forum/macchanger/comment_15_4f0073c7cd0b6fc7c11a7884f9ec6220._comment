Absolutely! Especially the wireless MAC must be changed before the original is leaked to an eavesdropper ( such as the Gov. to use against the leaker ). Like Liberte does. If there is a need to use the real MAC ,it must yield to the need for anonymity in a supposedly security/anonymity-oriented distro. That's why it's used after all. If the real MAC is needed it can easily be changed after boot. 
  Again, the anonymity must be the default.
