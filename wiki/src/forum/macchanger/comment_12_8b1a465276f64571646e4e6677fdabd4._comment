> Installing macchanger-gtk would make end-users think all they need to protect themselves against such threats is to change their mac address once booted. 

You're right, but the same argument can be used for many other applications (like Tor for example). We can't avoid a misuse of the applications we ship, so IMHO, Tails should ship macchanger-gtk *and* a warning documentation.

The subject have been often discussed on this forum, and I guess we have now enough raw material to write something relevant..
