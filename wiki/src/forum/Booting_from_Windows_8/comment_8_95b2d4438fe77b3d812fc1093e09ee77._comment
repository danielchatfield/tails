Booting from Windows 8 Solved (part 2)

I am forced to use Tails because the Singaporean government is clamping down on free speech in recent days.

Some thirty Malaysians working in Singapore have been arrested by Singapore Police for speaking out against dirty tactics practised during the Malaysian General Elections.

The Singaporean government has hit out at The Financial Times for telling the truth about the case of American scientist, Dr Shane Todd, who was murdered in Singapore. The FBI believe it is a murder but the Singapore Police claim it is a suicide.

It is common knowledge in Singapore that if you send in your computer for repairs, there is a strong possiblity that malware may be installed on the orders of the Singapore government.
