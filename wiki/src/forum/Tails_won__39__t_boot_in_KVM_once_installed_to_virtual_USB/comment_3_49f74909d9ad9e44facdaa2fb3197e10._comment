> I either assign a block storage device in /dev/ to the VM as a virtual USB device,

The version of libvirt that's in Debian testing makes it so such a virtual USB device is marked as non-removable. Tails won't boot from it unless you remove `live-media=removable` from the kernel command-line.

The \"default way\" is of little help without some more information about your setup.
E.g. I've no idea what's the default way on Fedora X or OpenSUSE Y.
I suspect this \"default way\" has the same drawback (non-removable device) described above.

In any case, please try the \"USB Host device\" forwarding and report back if it does not work.
