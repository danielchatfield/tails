I either assign a block storage device in /dev/ to the VM as a virtual USB device, or I create a KVM disk in the default way and assign that to tails. Either way it hangs with 100% CPU at the boot menu.

I'll see if I can figure out where the KVM settings are, but if you want to test it like I did then just `apt-get install kvm virt-manager` and create a VM with a new USB disk using the interface and do the most obvious thing.
