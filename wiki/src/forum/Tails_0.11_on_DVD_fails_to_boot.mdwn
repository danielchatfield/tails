I am looking for help to finally get Tails 0.11 running.

Downloaded ISO has been pgp checked OK and first tried on USB created by advised Universal-USB-Installer.
Tried any combination of kernel boot commands without success, then repeated the same with a DVD, same result.

Debug would show a page full of "udevd SYSFS will be removed in a future version..." "udevd BUS will be..."
As the number of attemts shows, these two lines are repeated to 35 times.
The last line a message complaining something about "10-blackberry.rules"

I downloaded and booted Debian 6.0.4, which booted straight to a desktop.

Your help will be very much appreciated..
