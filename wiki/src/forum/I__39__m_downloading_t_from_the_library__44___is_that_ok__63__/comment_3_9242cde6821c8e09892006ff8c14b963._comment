Well I don't think all libraries have cameras unless they're hidden because the one I'm at right now seems without cameras (brand new library though). But I don't know. Yeah I guess it is stupid to download tails at the library? What do you guys suggest just curious (though its I guess too late now)?

Yeah I don't know nothing about the technical really but it causes fears to where I guess one would worry there's a mac address or whatever somehow unique for that device and that windows or the OS can somehow behind the scenes against the user track that number to see where it goes and maybe what computer's it connects to. I don't know.
