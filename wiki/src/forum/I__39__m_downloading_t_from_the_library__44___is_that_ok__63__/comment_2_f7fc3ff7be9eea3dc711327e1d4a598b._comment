>I guess my concern with downloading it at the library is I'm doing it because I fear the isp concern (live in USA if that helps)

What do you fear from the ISP/library/gov? Tails is free & legal in the US and download corruption/tampering can easily be detected with the signature file.

>another thing is I connected my flash drive to the computer and it auto downloaded the driver so is there some sort of mac address tracked now or something?

I'm not sure this makes sense. MAC addresses are internal \"serial numbers\" of network devices, they are transmitted locally over LAN connections and/or WiFi radio. Could you rephrase the question?
