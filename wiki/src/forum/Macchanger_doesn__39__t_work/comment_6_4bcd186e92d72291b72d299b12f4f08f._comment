The solution bellow depends on the used material.


In my situation, I have a Hotkey shortcut (Fn + F2) that allows me to reactivate the wifi, when desactivated in BIOS. 

The problem is that I can only change the MAC address of this Wifi device when it's activated.. So here is the way I do:

- desactivate the wifi in BIOS
- turn on Tails
- write the folowing command line in a root terminal:
  *macchanger -a wlan0*
without pushing enter, otherwise I get the message '*set device name: No such device*'
- turn off the network with the icon in the top-right corner of the screen
- activate the wifi device with the hotkeys
- push *enter*, as soon as possible, in the terminal where I wrote *macchanger -a wlan0*
- f*cking prey that my real MAC adress was not leaked before it was changed..
- turn on the network with the icon in the top-right corner of the screen

There is probably a way to improve this with comment 3

There is no way, as far as I konw, to be sure that the real MAC adress is not leaked

Depending on your material, it's also possible that your wifi device send a message around, containig you real MAC adress, even before Tails starts..

We should perhaps have a look to *rfkill*, or kick out the wifi card from the computer (this is the solution I choosed)

Good luck,
