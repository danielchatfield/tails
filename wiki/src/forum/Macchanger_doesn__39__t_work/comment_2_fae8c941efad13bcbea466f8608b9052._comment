Before to use macchanger, you need to desactivate the device :

You can right-click on the network manager's icon on the top-right of your screen, and select 'desactivate network', then use the command line, and re-activate the network.

Please notice that your real MAC adress is probably leaked before you change it, and recorded by all the wifi access points around you... To avoid this, you can perhaps desactivate the wifi in the BIOS of your computer and then reactivate it after you modified your MAC adress. It seems to depend on your material..

Good luck,
