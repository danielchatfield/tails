hey mike. how would I roughly go about deactivating my wifi in BIOS? I probably could figure that out, but would this make it easy to re-activate my wifi when exiting BIOS and booting up into Tails?  How would I go about doing that (would there be a terminal command?)

Also to make sure these steps are correct, to clarify:
1) De-activate wifi in BIOS
2) Boot into Tails, change MAC address using macchanger in root terminal
3) Re-activate wifi (How? If it is deactivated in BIOS do I have to approach this differently than simply clicking \"activate network\" on my network icon?)'

Thanks for the help so far!
