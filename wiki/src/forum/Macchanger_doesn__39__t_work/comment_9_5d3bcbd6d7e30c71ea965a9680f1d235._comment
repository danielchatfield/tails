Followed the instructions in comment #3 & was finally able to change my MAC address

  ifconfig wlan0 down

  macchanger -a -e wlan0

  ifconfig wlan0 up

I had already connected to a wireless network; it took a few seconds then the connection went down, & then my laptop tried to automatically restore the connection.  Apparently, it's neccessary to skip the process of making a connection with the NetworkManager Applet (in the rightmost set of icons in the top panel).  

Open a terminal window & enter the above three commands, then go to the NetworkManager Applet & connect to a network.
