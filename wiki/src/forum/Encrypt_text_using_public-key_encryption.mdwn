hi just another newbie here. First of all I want to thank all Tails developers and all the people involved. great job!
I know it may sound moronic to you but anyway...don't shoot...So When I try to encrypt text in Gedit using public-key encryption I have to choose recipient key. So there is that window to do it but of course there's only yours (Tails developers) key in there. My question is how the hell can I add other people's keys?

Oh well I was going to start a new topic for that but hell... this question is even more stupid than last one - have mercy :)
So until recently I was using torchat due to its simplicity. But your opinion about it is not very encouraging. So I decided to give this pidgin bird a try...I've read documentation about OTR stuff but still I just can't make it to work. Let's say I start Tails and Pidgin, my husband on his buisness trip does the same - what should we do to contact? There are 3 accounts already configurated - should we use one of those? Or should we create new ones (some yahoo, g talk stuff like that)?
