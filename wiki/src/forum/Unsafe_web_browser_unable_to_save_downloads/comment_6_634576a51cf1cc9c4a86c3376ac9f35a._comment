for anyone who has the same problem I did (not realizing that unsafe browser was chrooted and downloaded a huge file that I didn't want to pass through Tor) here is the solution:

root terminal
cd cd /var/lib/unsafe-browser/chroot/home/clearnet/
(find your file)
cp foundfile /media/(safe USB location)

while security people may hate it, frankly for my current needs it worked perfectly.

Cheers!
