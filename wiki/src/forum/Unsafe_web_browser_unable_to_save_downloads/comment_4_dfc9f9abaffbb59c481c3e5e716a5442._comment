OP

Thanks for the answer. I guess it could be worse then.
Even so, would there not be a way to mitigate this attack in the event of an \"arbitrarely code exploit\" in the application used to open the file?

I could see for example, instead of tails automatically sending trafic though Tor by transparent proxying, as I believe it is the case now, (correct me if I am wrong) just blocking outgoing trafic from files. What implications would this have on usability?

A middle term could be if you implemented some kind of sandbox, for exemple Two diferent persistent folders: the normal one and the sandboxed one. This could be usefull also when accessing files from another pen (obtained via clearnet or not) to prevent against such attacks..This,perhaps, could also mean that you could allow the unsafe web browser to make downloads...assuming the Torrified browser and other applications would be automatically turned off when that happened. You could also put this on Tails greeter like \"Enable Unsafe/Non-anonimous mode\" or something..

Regarding Bitorrent and torrent/magnet link validation...Mind you as this is wild speculation from someone not into the fundamental way that program work...but..  Would there not be a better way to establish trust than the Web of Trust?...I mean.. I have sean tails documentation and other regarding that and a trust path seams something awfully hard for a not tecnically inclined person to be able to manage..I will definatly look into it however..

Could an intermediate sollution between the centralised (and compromisable) certificate autorities and the decentralised (and not user friendly) web of trust not be found? Something that could make use of the blockchain concept of bitcoin for exemple... lots of computers decentralizedlly publishing who trusts who, and whoose files... then a simple check sum validation beetween the file to be autenticated and the decentralized blockchain could be done for those of us mot very computer literate...

Once again I appologise if this is mumbo jumbo or something.. I'm not from the IT-field and I'm trying to think about many new concepts without proficiency..and without the ability to code or understand code that can lead to ideas that simply are not feasible...
