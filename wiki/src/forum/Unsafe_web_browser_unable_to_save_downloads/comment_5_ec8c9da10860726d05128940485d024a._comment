Did someone find a way to save downloaded files from the Unsafe Browser?

Taking in account all the reasons **not to do this**, written here and [[on this other thread|/forum/Unsafe_browser_webmail_attachments/]], I'm searching for a way to access the files previously downloaded with the Unsafe Browser **once disconnected from the network, and restarting Tails after those manipulations**.

Thanks for any tip or search path.
