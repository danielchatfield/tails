OP

Now that you say it... I could see someone altering a doc or pdf or other file saved when on clearnet and that if opened would access/report to a website through Tor, leaking the Tor IP for that session, and linking it with the original IP used for the original downloading of the file. 

Mind you, I am quite new to anonimity so maybe I am making a fool of myself and that would not be tecnically possible (I hope so)..If it is however, it would also affect files moved from a different OS (say windows) to the persistent folder would it not?

Another question if you don't mind: Is the bitorrent protocol imnune to MITM attacks? or more resistent since it checks data integrity comming from a variaty of IP that an atacker migth not have available?

If so, if/once Tails has a bitorrent client, would it be safer to download the new isos by bitorrenting? Or with an I2P torrent through I2PSnark?

Thanks
