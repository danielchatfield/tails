Using Tails 0.12 with no modifications, persistance is enabled. I have configured Claws for a POP email account and everything is working for sending/recieving email. However, everytime I reboot Tails and open Claws all the mail previously downloaded is gone. "Claws Mail" is enabled under the Tails Persistance Wizard. Tails/Claws appears to be recreating the the email account folder every reboot at /amnesia/"account name". Thanks for the help.
