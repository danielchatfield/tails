I'm just finding out about this program and have been reading up on the pages that describe what tor is for but I still feel confused and am wondering if I should really use this program or not and for what after reading the articles about tor over and over. I guess I just doubt myself feeling unsure if this really is what I should do and need assured. I think I'm a bit of a newb to the technicalities of the internet and computers but feel there's something to fear and I guess don't really know what. I've been really afraid though to use the internet or send email or anything just feeling tracked somehow someway and paranoid about it I guess. Don't even really know what's going on and what to be afraid of but just expecting the worst and holding myself back from the internet feeling no way to get around the bad that it could start and not seeing the internet as ok/private to use.

I haven't used tor yet cause I'm still wondering if I should or not and if so then how. Like for one should I use it on my internet or for everytime I want to do something I feel uncomfortable doing like an email or should I just use it on public wifi areas or something? I have been wondering about ISP's and if they are a problem like what they see. I've also been wondering if it matters what computer I get on as well. Can someone help me determine this and decide if I should use tor or not?
