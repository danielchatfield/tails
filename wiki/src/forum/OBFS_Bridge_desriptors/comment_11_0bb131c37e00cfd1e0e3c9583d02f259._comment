I must respectfully say that this line tells that you have absolutely no clue about anonymity.

> I am in a position where privacy is curcial, it might also be life threatning.

Forget about it. Don't try. Too difficult. With your current knowledge about anonymity, question skills and learning skills you will mess up at some point in the middle.

Btw, RTFM!
