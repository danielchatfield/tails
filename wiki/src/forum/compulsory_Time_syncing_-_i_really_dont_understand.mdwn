    Why there is no on/off switch?(for Time sync)
"Because it would be dangerous. See Time syncing."


BUT Tails developer writes, too:
https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/fingerprint/index.en.html
"This behavior could be used to distinguish Tails from TBB users, especially this happens every time Tails starts."

Automatic use of this feature is really
.... irritating.
Not every user is needing this - compulsory Time sync.
