would someone mind briefly walking me through how to send an encrypted message? I can't seem to get it to work. First I import the recipients key, then I copy it into text edit and write my message after it (with a line/space in between) then I encrypt the whole thing with my clipboard. Is tails going to recognise the key from my imports or is there something I'm missing?
thanks for any help
