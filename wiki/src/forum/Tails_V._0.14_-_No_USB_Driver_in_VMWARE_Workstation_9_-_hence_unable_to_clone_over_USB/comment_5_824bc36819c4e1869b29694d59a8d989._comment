>Windows 8 Professional is crappiest operating system and doesn't allow Administrative access even to \"admin' users! One needs a lot of new things to learn to disable certain features, and above all it doesn't allow anyone to install Antivirus system :(

Oh hell. Sounds like Microsoft has cooked up another crapload of crap which **the rest of the world** will have to contend with for years to come, as soon as sufficient numbers of the Windows using mindless majority have had it pushed into their hands. Wonderful. Would you like to upgrade that with our Code-Red III bonus bundle Sir? It'll come free in a few months but why wait when you can be one of the first? How about a nice dose of Syphilis too?

Thanks for the update though ;)
