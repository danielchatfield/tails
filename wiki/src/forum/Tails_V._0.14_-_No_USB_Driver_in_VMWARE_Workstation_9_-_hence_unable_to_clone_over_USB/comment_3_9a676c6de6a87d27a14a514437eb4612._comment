I have succeeded in making clone onto USB drive after restoring the image of Win-7. Actually Windows 8 Professional is crappiest operating system and doesn't allow Administrative access even to \"admin' users! One needs a lot of new things to learn to disable certain features, and above all it doesn't allow anyone to install Antivirus system :(

So it was not allowing load USB DRIVERS in VMWare Workstation. So if you also face similar problem, clone Tails ISO onto USB through Windows-7.
