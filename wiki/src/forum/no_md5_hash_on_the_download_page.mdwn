Hello.

There is no MD5 hash or SHA256 hash or whatever on the download page of Tails... :((

I'm not so advanced in PC to do the PGP key checking... so only the MD5 hash or something like it can help me verify the integrity of the download... Why it is not there? 

As you can see on the link, VLC have the MD5 hash below every download link...

Why is not the same with Tails? We are not all geeks in computers... Thx...
