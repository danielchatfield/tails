Re. [Iceweasel 5.x](https://tails.boum.org/todo/Iceweasel_5.x/)

I've installed Iceweasel 6.0.2 from testing OK (having got a very definite \"cannot be authenticated\" error on the first attempt - so watch out here!).

The following extensions install fine from within Iceweasel (i.e., the Add-ons menu):

* Adblock Plus 1.3.9
* CS Lite 1.4.1.1
* FoxyProxy Basic 2.2
* HTTPS-Everywhere 1.0.3
* Monkeyspere 0.6
* Public Fox 1.09 (hint hint)

Note xul-ext-monkeysphere, xul-ext-adblock-plus and xul-ext-https-everywhere packages are available in testing (not tried them as yet).

As to [symmetric OpenPGP](https://tails.boum.org/todo/symmetric_OpenPGP_vs_recent_Iceweasel/) I must admit I'd like to play around with this myself - what is the situation with the IPC extension and 6.0.2? (taking over development of FireGPG would probably save a ton of coding).
