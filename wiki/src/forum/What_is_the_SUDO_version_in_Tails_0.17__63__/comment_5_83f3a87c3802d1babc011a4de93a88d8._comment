>  A vulnerability in sudo – a program that manages user privileges on certain types of systems – could allow an unauthenticated user to execute commands for about five minutes, without entering a password.  The problem, which has since been fixed, previously existed in builds 1.6.0 through 1.7.10p6 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6 of sudo

It seems that Tails 0.17 uses sudo version 1.7.4p4. The vulnerability was announced a few days *after* Tails 0.17 was released, if I am not mistakes.

So it seems that this *does* affect Tails 0.17.

It seems that the vulnerability is a local vulnerability allowing someone who is already logged into a Tails system to execute commands with root privileges for several minutes.  This would presumably not be a problem if one believes that there are no undisclosed *remote* vulnerabilities in Tails 0.17 which could perhaps be exploited together with the sudo problem.

@ \"Tails\":

Did I guess correctly about your thinking?
