>Is this a general fault of 0.14?

Maybe. It is presently very dependant on your hardware.

>How can I ensure it shuts down after my tails session & all traces are removed?

It is fine to simply turn off or unplug at the point the shutdown hangs. There are no persistent \"traces\". If you believe you may become the target of a [cold boot attack](https://tails.boum.org/doc/advanced_topics/cold_boot_attacks/index.en.html) or that after booting into another OS it may attempt to harvest your Tails data from unused RAM, you could run a pass of memtest - that would probably be a sensible precaution for anyone who feels they may be facing such sophisticated and determined threats as these *anyway*.
