Hi,

for safety, make sure you store it in an ancrypted file, folder or partition on another usb harddrive. Tails is non-persistent meaning all data is lost when you shut it down. To export your secret key, open a terminal and type the following:

gpg --export-secret-keys -a > your key name

The '-a >' command will output the file to your amnesia directory ('amnesia's home' icon underneath 'computer' icon, top left). Then copy it to an encrypted medium as mentioned above.
