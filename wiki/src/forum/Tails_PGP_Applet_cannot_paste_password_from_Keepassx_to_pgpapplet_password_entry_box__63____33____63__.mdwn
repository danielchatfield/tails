Hi peeps,

I came across a problem in the new release 0.17

When i want to decrypt a pgp message and my password is asked for decrypting I can not copy/paste my password from clipboard to the entry box. So it only is possible to enter my password manually. I have a strong passwords because I use KeepassX. I hope my explanation is clear enough. 

I like to know if this a problem i have locally or has this been modified because it was working just fine in 0.16?
