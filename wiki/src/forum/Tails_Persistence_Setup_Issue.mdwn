I was wondering of anyone may have a solution to the problem
 I am encountering. I am trying to set up persistence in tails .11. I have installed tails off of a USB that had tails on it already(which I installed using my computer). The problem is that I do not see an option to create the persistent volume when I start up and I cannot create one in the menu when logged in.

Thank you for reading
