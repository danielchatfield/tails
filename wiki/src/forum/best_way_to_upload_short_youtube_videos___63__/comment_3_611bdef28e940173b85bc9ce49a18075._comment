I also agree with the comment made by 1 & 2

Part solution
-------------
- Possible solution to removing metadata from your videos could be done with software such as ffmpeg

Other issues to consider
------------------------
- New Tor circuits (IP address) are created about every 10 minutes, and may get flagged by youtube as an \"attack\". Others maybe better informed than myself but you might want to use bridges to keep the exit node (IP address) if uploading take longer than 10 minutes.

- JS could be a serious risk of leaking your IP address. However, you might beable to use the HTML5 to upload ?

I might give it ago and report back my findings if anyone interested ?
