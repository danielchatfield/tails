I just experienced something nearly the same to what the OP described. I was running the latest Tails (0.14) and everything seemed to be going fine when I got up and left my computer for a few minutes. When I came back, my screen had gone black and blank (No flashing cursor. I did not try shining a light on the screen but did look at it close-up and could not discern anything beyond the faintest background illumination). Neither moving my finger around on the touchpad nor hitting random keys would bring my screen back to life. I also tried `alt-ctrl-backspace` in the hopes of restarting my X session but to no avail. Finally, I just yanked out the USB flash stick that I was running Tails from and my laptop shut down completely shortly afterward.

I have been using Tails for around two years now (including a number of successful sessions with the same 0.14) (mainly on the same hardware) and do not recall experiencing this before.

This sounds plausible in my case, particularly given the age of the laptop in question (almost ten years, I think). I will have to see how it performs both with future sessions of Tails as well with other OSes.
