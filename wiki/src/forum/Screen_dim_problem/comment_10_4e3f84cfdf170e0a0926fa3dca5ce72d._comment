Sounds like a backlight control problem - *possibly* in the in-kernel drivers.

Do either of these pages provide any help pinning it down?..

If you [report a bug](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/index.en.html), as much of the info requested on the Ubuntu page above as you can glean from your machine could be very useful in your report ;o)
