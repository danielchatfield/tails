I installed Tails to a USB drive and started it up. Started i2p from the menu. However whenever I try to go to any i2p site it says it is unreachable... even ones that should certainly be up like postman and i2p2. Anyone know anything that can help?

I wanted to ask for help here before I list it has a bug, since it very well could be my fault, or I overlooked something in the documentation.
