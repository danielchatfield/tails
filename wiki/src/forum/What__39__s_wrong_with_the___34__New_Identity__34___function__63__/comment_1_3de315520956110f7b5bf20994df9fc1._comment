>Is it really necessary to restart Tails or is there a way to make the \"new identity\" functions work?

1. Close browser
2. Vidalia -> \"New Identity\"
3. Start browser

..*Should* work. You'll get a new private session so there *should* be no persistence and all the \"streams\" will have been \"closed\". Restart if you need to be *sure* though ;o)
