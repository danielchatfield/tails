Is there no way to be sure the streams have closed? This would save a great deal of time. Also someone might correlate your rebooting with, for example, timestamps in this forum. Seems like this might be more obvious than restarting Tor. 

Why won't Tails let us stop and start tor through Vidalia anymore. Would that close all streams for sure?


Somebody claims that [streams are left open even after \"Vidalia is stopped\" or the \"network is brought down\"](https://tails.boum.org/forum/Tor_process_sometimes___39__sticks__39___and_is_downloading_something_until_process_manually_killed/). Could somebody just come out and admit if this is spyware? You would probably feel a lot better.
