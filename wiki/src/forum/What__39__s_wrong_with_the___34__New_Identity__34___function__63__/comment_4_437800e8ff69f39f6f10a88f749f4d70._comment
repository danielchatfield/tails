Basically, a few undocumented methods *should* give you something that can be called a \"new identity\", with some amount of safety, under some definition of \"new identity\", **but** they rely on too much details we have not checked, and there's much confusion among users about what that \"new identity\" thing means exactly (e.g. some seem to think it implies getting a new Exit Node as result).

Also, Tails is a full operating system, so a \"new identity\" should be thought at this level, not merely in the web browser.

So, until we have seriously thought through what Tails could seriously aim at providing on this front, we don't pretend it does anything good. Hence the \"shutdown and restart Tails every time you're using a new identity\" advice.
