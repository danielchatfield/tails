laughed out loud at above comment.

seriously though, I think that the above poster has a good point - those who may need tails and tor the most may be less likely to have access to modern hardware and could be limited to public computers that have neither dvd drives nor the capabilitiy to boot from USB. Add to the fact that making and distributing a CD rather than a bootable USB is much less complex for the average user (not to mention cheaper). I don't even have a DVD drive (let alone DVR) and I hardly live in the third world.

I appreciate the new language options but I think that not being able to fit tails on a CD is a pity and that it could harm those who may need tails the most.

What is more important - universal language support or supporting people with limited access to computer hardware? hopefully a compromize which doesn't exclude those at the lower end of the scale can be made.

While supporting two different releases may not be feasible, I'm sure that the tails dev's can come up with a creative solution.... *kiss kiss* there I went and did for you above_poster ;p
