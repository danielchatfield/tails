Commenter 1 here. No, those aren't options for me. And for every complaint there are usually more who are silent. This is a hurdle, a sudden change of requirements, and every hurdle like this always causes some loss of users. Worse still how many people will just keep using the old versions because they can't upgrade and aren't aware of other similar projects.

If i18n is really the cause of this explosion, then is it possible to split up languages, so there are 2 or 3 ISOs, each under 700 MB, which are identical except for the languages?

I'm finding the i18n comment astonishing though. 0.10.2 was 619M. 0.11 is 753M. How is a sudden increase of 134M even <i>possible?</i> Did you forget to compress it?
