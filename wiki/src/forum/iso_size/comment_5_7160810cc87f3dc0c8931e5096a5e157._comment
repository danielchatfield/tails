> If i18n is really the cause of this explosion, then is it possible to split up languages, so there are 2 or 3 ISOs, each under 700 MB, which are identical except for the languages?

This would be great, provided we have enough developer time to deal with the added complexity and work. Currently, we clearly don't have this time available.

> I'm finding the i18n comment astonishing though. 0.10.2 was 619M. 0.11 is 753M. How is a sudden increase of 134M even possible?

We moved from \"only a handful of languages supported, all other locales purged\" to \"all possible locales supported\", and now install all `iceweasel-l10n-*` packages. This explains most of this increase.

Sarcasm rarely helps convincing people.
