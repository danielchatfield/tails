The loss of information depends on the temperature of the RAM. At roomtemperature it is theoretically possible to extract data (like encryption keys) for only some minutes but with liquid nitrogen it could be several hours or longer. Search for cold boot attack.

\"Also, does the fact that Tails is wiping the RAM reveal to any examiner that you have been using TAILS on your system?\"

It should not be possible to reveal that you used tails for the RAM wipe as only random data should be present after the wipe and this also only for a few minutes. But one could maybe find out that a RAM wipe was performed, at least if the examiner is fast enough. Eventually he will find your USB stick or DVD with Tails and make his conclusions :D
