Not 2, but I've noticed this also.

In the Tails browser menu, in Tails 0.17 (and other recent editions), using

     Edit -> Preferences -> Privacy -> accept cookies & exceptions

you can choose to allow session only cookies for particular websites, and to block cookies by default.

In recent editions of TBB up to 2.3.25-4, this was also the case for the Tor Browser menu.  But in TBB 2.3.25-4, when you follow

     Edit -> Preferences -> Privacy

you only see nothing at all about cookies, and searching through the entire menu turns up no discernable mechanism for disabling cookies, or allowing session only cookies for some websites.

In the announcement for TBB 2.3.25-4, the Tor Project seems to hint that they believe that allowing users to tweak how they use cookies is somehow \"no longer relevant\".  I have no idea how they came to that conclusion and consider in questionable.

Does anyone know how to tweak cookies in TBB 2.3.25-4?  Do we go into about:config?  Install Cookie Monster add-on?  What?
