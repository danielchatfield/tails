I agree that the concern is well-founded and worrisome, but don't forget that the governments with the best-funded intelligence collection efforts (and maybe more important, with the greatest poolof potentially talented persons to draw their operatives from) are in generally not exactly friends.  USA, Russia, China are some which immediately spring to mind.  And if you think of the USA and Israel as close allies, remember that the nation to which Israel devotes the greatest spying effort is said to be none other than her supposed ally, the US.  Not saying anything for or against any of these nations (and least, not in this thread), just pointing out that things might not be quite as bad as it might first appear, because US and Chinese intelligence (for example) are probably not sharing all the information they gather.

If you live in the US, China, or Russia, however, it probably is true that you may experience more difficulty evading scrutiny by your own government than by an \"adversary\" government.

An interesting point regarding a little known new scheme (see silentcircle.com), which may or may not be a sting operation (I doubt PZ would knowingly cooperate with any such thing, but he might be an unwilling participant), is that VOIP calls going point to point in the US are routed to Canada or Switzerland, and if the recipient doesn't use Silent Circle, are routed back in the clear, thus making it \"legal\" for the NSA to intercept, store, and analyze the contents.  I think Silent Circle is intriguing and rather hope that CEOs of companies large and small will use it routinely, but unless both parties are customers of Silent Circle, the cure may be worse than the disease.  (The stated reason why SC locates its servers in Switzerland and Canada is that they think they can better resist demands for warrantless access in those countries.)  It is interesting to NSA watchers to see how many point to point US calls starting being mysteriously routed into Canada or Mexico and back after 9/11; some of us suspect this and a huge effort to increase NSA access to traffic across those borders resulted from a rather simple-minded effort to circumvent pre-9/11 laws without invoking the more dire aspects of the USA PATRIOT act.  Just a conjecture.
