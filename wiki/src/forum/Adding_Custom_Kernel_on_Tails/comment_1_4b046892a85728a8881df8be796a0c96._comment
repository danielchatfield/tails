> The Tails tree is a bit different by the one reported in debian live manual.

You're probably looking at the wrong version of the manual. Tails is built with live-build 2.x.

> Also, in your git you have your version of live-build and live-config.

My eyes disagree.

You are free to replace random bits of Tails, but then, deal with the consequences, and don't expect this to behave as Tails :)
