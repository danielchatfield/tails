>> Even if you running off a USB or a DVD do not forget that Tails keeps logs of many activities stored locally which contains identifying information such as Hardware info (types, serials, brands, etc..). I dont know how this could be avoided. A guess would be \"using VM\" ? Dunno. My question about keyloggers also remain.

How about disabling logging in Tails? Also remove dmidecode and related commands.
