According to Bruce Schneier and NATO there is no such thing as 'safe' software VOIP encryption. Maybe if you had a hardware vocoder box and your contact did as well.

If it was safe every government would be using it but none of them do.
As for a cell dongle, GSM can be decrypted easily but thankfully Tor can't so you are fine. Would your ISP know about this? Yes so maybe boot tails in bridge mode
