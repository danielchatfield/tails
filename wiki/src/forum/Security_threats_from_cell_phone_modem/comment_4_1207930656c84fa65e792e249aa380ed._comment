I connect to the internet via tails via connect to wireless broadband (GSM) then select local provider, I havent installed additional software. I did find some information on wiki

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_cryptanalysis

Acoustic cryptanalysis can be used to monitor the sound created by someone typing on a computer. Each key on the keyboard makes a subtly different acoustic signature when stroked. It is then possible to identify which keystroke signature relates to which keyboard character via statistical methods such as frequency analysis.

Since the mobile phone is located so close to the keyboard, I will have to start using the florence virtual keyboard to avoid this vulnerability

Thank you for your reply, I think some people get knocked for offering their opinion or posting because they are not experts. If we had experts to answer all our questions there wouldn't be a need for forums
