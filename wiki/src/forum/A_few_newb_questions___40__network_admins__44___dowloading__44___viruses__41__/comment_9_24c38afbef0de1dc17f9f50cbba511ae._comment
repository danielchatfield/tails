>Since this happens on the Tails forum, then I should read it and make sure it does not contain anything we absolutely would not want to host here. Doing that work is called maintaining a general Tor forum, and that's exactly what I explained we haven't the resources to deal with.

>So, you're basically forcing me to either censor you, or do work I don't want to do, instead of spending my time usefully on Tails. Guess what? I'm not happy to be in this position.

Thanks for taking the time to explain this.

I'm not OP or one of the previous commentators but I've seen the more generic \"we haven't the resources...\" posts around the forum and I've been a bit puzzled about which resources they elluded to. It's obvious now of course. Perhaps some of the essence of this explanation could be borrowed to make the general message more compelling?
