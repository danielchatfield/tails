> I just started using Tails, and I love it.

Nice to read!

> 1 Can network admins see traffic?

> If I'm using a public network, I understand network admins can see I'm using Tor. If I'm using iceweasel and https everywhere, they can only see the LAN-port or wifi router the request is coming from and the entry node, correct?

It's unclear to me what network these \"admins\" are managing. Anyhow, this is a general Tor question, so please direct it to a general Tor discussion place: we don't have the resources to maintain a general Tor forum here, sorry.

> 2 Can network admins tell when I'm downloading something, and will I plug up the network?

Also not specific to Tails, please direct it to a more adequate place. Thank you :)

> 3 How much do I have to worry about spyware comprimising security?

> If I download word non-executable files like documents, videos, music, from relatively trustworthy sources, how much do I need to worry about getting malware?

It depends on what *relatively trustworthy* means, and on how much you trust your network connections to these sources.

> Are there many known exploits for Tails or the version of Debian its based off of?

Such exploits [are discovered on a regular basis](http://security.debian.org/).

> And if I do get some sort of malware, how would I know, and how could I ensure that it doesn't replicate into other files?

I think that using a read-only medium is the only foolproof way to ensure this.

> and thanks to everyone working on Tails.

You're welcome :)
