> Because the Tor Project unfortunately doesn't offer its own forum where users can easily interact with the user/developer community with Tor specific questions, I think that inevitably Tails users will want to ask in this forum some general Tor-related questions which are not specifically Tails related.

It's especially inevitable if people go on replying to such off-topic questions, practically encouraging other users to go on asking them.

If you want to help, here's the Tor ticket about setting up a forum:
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5995

You're forcing my hand, and I don't like it.
I now have two reasonable alternatives:

a. Remove your post (and the resulting discussion).
b. Leave your post (and the resulting discussion) online.
   Since this happens on the Tails forum,
   then I should read it and make sure it does not contain
   anything we absolutely would not want to host here.
   Doing that work is called maintaining a general Tor forum,
   and that's exactly what I explained we haven't the resources to deal with.

So, you're basically forcing me to either censor you, or do work
I don't want to do, instead of spending my time usefully on
Tails. Guess what? I'm not happy to be in this position.

The third alternative I can see (ignoring the whole thing) is
even less satisfying, because then this forum would be entirely
open to spammers of all kinds, the signal/noise ratio would
decrease again, and the end result won't be useful for anyone.
