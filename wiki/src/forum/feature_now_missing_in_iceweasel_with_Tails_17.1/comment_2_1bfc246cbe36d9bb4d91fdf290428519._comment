I will explain.

Trt to highlight / select any text in any iceweasel webpage. Now try to drag this text and drop it in a text file or in iceweasel search box or in address bar. You cant. That used to work in the previous edition of Tails. Something changed in the browser. I need this feature back.

Now if you want to move text around, you will have to copy-paste instead of drag-drop.

Secondly, if you try to do this the other way around it doesnt work either. If you highlight select text from outside iceweasel (like a document) and then try to drag that text and drop it in a text box in an iceweasel page it doesnt work anymore. You will also have to copy and paste.

I just want to know why is that feature now disabled and how to get it back.
