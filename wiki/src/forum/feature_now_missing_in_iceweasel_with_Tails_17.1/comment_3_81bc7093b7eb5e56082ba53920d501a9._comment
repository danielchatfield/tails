Thanks for the clarification. I'm sorry about this regression.
It does not look critical enough, in my humble opinion, to focus
on it right now rather than on the many other important issues we
have to tackle.

> I just want to know why is that feature now disabled

We did not disable this feature on purpose. It might be
a regression of Firefox 17.0.4esr, or a regression caused by our
custom patched built of it.

> and how to get it back.

Try to reproduce it on:

* the latests TBB based on Firefox 17.0.4esr
* unpatched Firefox 17.0.4esr
* unpatched iceweasel 17.0.4esr

and report back.

And/or wait for our next iteration (that will be based on 17.0.5esr)
and hope it automagically fixes things up.

And/or [[contribute]] to Tails so that developers have more time
to deal with such issues :)
