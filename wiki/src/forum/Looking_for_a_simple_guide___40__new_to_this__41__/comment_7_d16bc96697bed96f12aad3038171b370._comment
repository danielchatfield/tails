Even police are sometimes shocked by the not infrequently illegal actions of their colleagues.

> One regional Dutch police woman told us that they know how to check if it's a Tor exit IP, but *sometimes they do the raid anyway \"to discourage people from helping Tor.\"* I later told that statement to one of the national police, and he was shocked, said that was illegal, and said he'd look into it. Alas, I'm not optimistic that anything will come of it: giving investigators discretion about how to act can be both good and bad.

Raiding someone even when you know they have committed no crime, simply to discourage them from doing something legal which makes your job as a cop a bit harder, is illegal in almost all \"Western-style\" democracies.  This shows again how important it is for all of us to try to lobby our own governments to replace the system of warrantless intimidation with a system of meaningful judicial oversight.
