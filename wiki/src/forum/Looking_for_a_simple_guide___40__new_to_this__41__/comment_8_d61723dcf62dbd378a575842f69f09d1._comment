>One reason for this that anyone can intercept a radio transmission, including your possibly not-nice neighbor in a cafe or airport lounge; another is that WiFi connections are more easily subject to potentially dangerous geolocation data leaks.

When one is using WiFi to access the internet with Tails' Iceweasel, even if the *radio transmission* is intercepted, the interceptor will only see encrypted information. Correct?

Moreover how can your geolocation be exposed when you are using Tails' Iceweasel on WiFi? All data packets transferred through Iceweasel travel through Tor-enabled tunnels, correct?
