Thanks for the suggestion.

The Tails documentation can already be downloaded in two different
ways (and formats): it's included in every Tails ISO image, and
therefore in every installed Tails system; it can also be downloaded
from our [[contribute/git]] repository. So, I don't think it's worth
working on yet another way to distribute this documentation.
