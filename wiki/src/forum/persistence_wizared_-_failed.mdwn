I manually isohybrid + cat'd a usb stick to avoid needing a dvd drive(from the official instructions). Then from the newly running tails 0.11 I did a usb install to another usb stick(again, as per instructions).

Now, running tails 0.11 from the second usb stick I tried to setup the persistent storage with "configure persistent volume" option.

it seems to start ok but then gets a failed interruption with this error:

org.freedesktop.UDisksx.Error.Busy:
A job is pending on /dev/sdc2
