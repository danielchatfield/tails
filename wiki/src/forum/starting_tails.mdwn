Hi there, I wonder if you can help me at all. I have downloaded tails, mounted the iso and now I would like to install it onto a 2bg usb. I opened the folder I have mounted the iso in, and according to this https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html to install it onto a usb I need to start tails first. How do I do that? In the folder I have 2 subfolders: isolinux and live. How do I start it please?
thanks
