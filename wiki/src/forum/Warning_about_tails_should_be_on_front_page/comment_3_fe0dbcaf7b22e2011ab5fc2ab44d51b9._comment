The [[warning|/doc/about/warning]] page is linked second from the [[Getting started...|getting_started]] page, fourth on the [[documentation index|/documentation]], and mentioned with a visible block in the first section of the [[download|/download]] page.

I think it is important to explain first what Tails do before explain what Tails does not, and I find that those links are sufficient. Maybe it would be better to have it on the front page as well, but I'm not ready to do that work right now.

If you want to keep on discussing that, please post your suggestion to tails-dev to get more devs give their opinion, and maybe find a volunteer to implement it.
