I just wanted to thank the folks who have developed this excellent tool. By making security and anonymity easier, you protect the privacy and free speech of all, especially oppressed groups and individuals. Of course you already knew that :)

Also, glad to read that the next release will be based on Debian Squeeze, this should clear up some driver issues I have noticed with the current release and ath5k wifi chipsets.

Keep up the great work!
