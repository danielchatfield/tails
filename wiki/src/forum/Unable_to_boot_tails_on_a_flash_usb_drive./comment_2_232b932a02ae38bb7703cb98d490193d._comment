I have same problem on HP Pavillion

selecting 'fail safe' produces just 2 x messages:

1. Failed to enable MSI-X
2. Failed to allocate MSI entry

Using tab and deleting 'quiet from the startup commandline produces masses of stuff but the system hangs after a series of messages startibg with something like 'failed to allocate motherboard resources' followed by failed to initialise EISA 1 through 6.

I have successfully installed tails on both CD and a Vitualbox VM on the same computer. When using the installed tails to create the USB system the USB file system becomes unreadable by windows 7. The file system does ramain readable when using Universal USB installer, but in both cases the boot sequence hangs at the same point.
