Could be a problem for Vidalia.
Looks like this:

torproject.org
Changes in version 0.2.3.16-alpha - 2012-06-05
- The advertised platform of a router now includes only its operating system's name (e.g., \"Linux\", \"Darwin\", \"Windows 7\"), and not its service pack level (for Windows) or its CPU architecture (for Unix).
We also no longer include the \"git-XYZ\" tag in the version. Resolves part of bug 2988.
