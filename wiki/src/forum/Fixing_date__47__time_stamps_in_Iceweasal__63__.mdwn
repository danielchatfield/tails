After the date/time for Tails is set, Iceweasal doesn't seem to pick it up.  In other words, the Iceweasal date/time stamps continue to reflect the timezone Tails started up in (UTC) regardless of how the system time has been set.  I think that's the issue anyway.  Is this a bug or is there a way to force Iceweasal to use the system date/time?  I tried exiting and relaunching Iceweasal, no dice.
