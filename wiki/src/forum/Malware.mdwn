What threat do viruses, trojans, scripting attacks, exploits, etc, pose to Tails users? More specifically, supposing the system gets compromised by an attacker(hacker who isn't specifically trying to nail Tor/Tails users) what are the odds my real IP will get leaked? 

Also, what are the possible attack vectors? Assuming I have NoScript set to disallow Javascript and don't download any files.
