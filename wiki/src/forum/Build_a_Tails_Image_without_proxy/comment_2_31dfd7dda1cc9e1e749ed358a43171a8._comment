Thank you for your reply. I have also errors like these:

Cannot stat sortlist entry \"live/overlay/var/run/utmp\"
This is probably because you're using the wrong file
path relative to the source directories
Cannot stat sortlist entry \"etc/init.d/live\"
This is probably because you're using the wrong file
path relative to the source directories
Cannot stat sortlist entry \"live/overlay/var/log/wtmp\"
This is probably because you're using the wrong file
path relative to the source directories


and some errors 

ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored.
