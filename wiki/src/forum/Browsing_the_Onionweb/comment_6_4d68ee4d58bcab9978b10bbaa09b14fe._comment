I see no reason to question the OP's sincerity, however I think that the idea that \"Onionweb or Darknet is full of child pornography\" is a gross exaggeration. In my experience I have only once stumbled on a pedophile image. I think you would have to actively search for the stuff to find a lot of it. I imagine that most pedophile stuff on darknet will be \"by invitation only\" and you would have nil chance of accessing it accidentally.
