You mean, I'm asking for a way to BLOCK pornographic content and you accuse me of being a pedophile or at the very least interested (for whatever reason) in acquiring child porn? That's quite a remarkable piece of illogica, my friend.

I want to explore the deepweb, but without the CP. I don't want to see any pictures, movies, or files depecting the abuse of children. Turns out you don't have control over what your browser downloads. At least when it comes to image files.
