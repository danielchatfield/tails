Dear peeps,

I would like to know if it is ok to download add-ons for Iceweasel or software such as vlc? I am using version 0.10.2. I know this version is non persistent so I am worried that I will mess up the install.

Also, is it possible to change the keyboard layout to another country? I couldn't find any way to change the preferences.

Thanks.

p.s. where can I download rc0.11? Do I need to add a ppa?
