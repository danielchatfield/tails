> Came here and read through the threads and found one solution of hitting tab at the debian splash page and typed \"vga=0x314 nomodeset\" hit enter and it loaded the bar but still hangs as before.

Which graphics card have you got (it sounds like a graphics card related issue)?

Please try adding `nomodeset` and `xorg-driver=vesa` to the kernel command line (accessed via hitting tab at the boot menu as you've already noticed). Make sure that there's a space between all such options you add there. You may also benefit from removing `splash` (which is already present) as that can reveil important debugging information.

> Also, not sure if it's related to this problem or not, if I reboot it will not load to the debian screen it just sits on a black screen unless I boot into bios each time and save&exit then it boots to the debian splash.

This sounds like a BIOS issue in your computer. If so, there's no much Tails can do about it.
