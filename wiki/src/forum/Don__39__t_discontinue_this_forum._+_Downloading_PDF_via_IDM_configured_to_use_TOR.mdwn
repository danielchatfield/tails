I have heard that the Tails Admins don't wanna continue with this forum. It is indeed a bad idea because these days the people read this forum to learn anonymity and forensic techniques. So far my knoledge is concerned, I have learnt a lot from the Tail Users' comments in posts published in this forum. Kindly don't discontinue with this forum, nor should the forum be shifted to somewhere else.

Another question is that yesterday I was downloading a PDF containing hi-resolution images (80 MB) and at 65% Tails browser stopped downloading it. Thereafter I consulted my friend and he asked me to download the same after configuring the IDM to use TOR. In order to confirm whether it indeed worked, I downloaded a file of 5 MB via IDM (after configuration) and it showed the link in the network map (i.e. it was showing download from the nodes as we usually see webpages routing through TOR network or Tails network properties).

Thereafter I copied the link of the PDF which I wanted to download, and pasted the link into IDM. It worked well and the speed was good. Does the PDF file so downloaded also use encryption mode? I mean, have I downloaded the said PDF in the same anonymous way as we download the files within browser?
