"Blachat conference, [Andrew "

"did a presentation about his research on [de-anonymization of Live "
"Cds](http://www.blackhat.com/html/bh-dc-11/bh-dc-11-briefings.html#Case) "
"through forensics techniques applied to the system memory content, which "
"mostly concerned T(A)ILS itself. Some part of it were also talking about "
"memory analysis of Tor itself."

"The disclosure of this attack leads to a better implementation of the smem "
"feature in T(A)ILS, using kexec to ensure every non-kernel bits of the "
"memory is wiped. Implementation of automatic memory wiping [[when the live "
"media is removed|todo/erase_memory_when_the_USB_stick_is_removed]] would "
"also help to defeat it, at least in the case this attack takes place when "
"someone's home is raided."
