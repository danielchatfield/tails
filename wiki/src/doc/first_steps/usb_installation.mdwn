[[!meta title="Installing onto a USB Stick"]]

Tails, version 0.11 or later, includes a custom USB installer.

<span class="application">Tails USB installer</span> allows you to **[[create a
persistent volume|persistence]]** in the free space left on the USB stick. It
requires a USB stick of **at least 2 GB**.

In order to use <span class="application">Tails USB installer</span>, you need

to install. You can either:

  - **[[Burn a Tails DVD|download#support]]** (recommended).
  - **Use another Tails USB stick**, version 0.11 or later, for example from a friend.
  - **[[Manually install Tails onto another USB
    stick|manual_usb_installation]]**, if you can't use a DVD.
