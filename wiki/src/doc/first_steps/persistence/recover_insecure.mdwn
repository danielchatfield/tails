[[!meta title="Recovering from insecure persistence settings"]]

<div class="caution">

<p><strong>Your persistent volume or its settings have insecure user
rights.</strong></p>

<p>This means that an attacker who could run an exploit from inside your
Tails session could corrupt the persistent volume settings. By doing
this, an attacker could possibly gain persistent administrator rights
or install malicious software.</p>

</div>

Under normal conditions, this should not happen. This might be
a problem in Tails, so please [[report an
error|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]].

To recover the data from your persistent volume, follow the instructions to
[[manually copy your persistent data to a new
device|copy]].

For more technical details about the security of the persistent volume,
read our [[design document|contribute/design/persistence#security]].
