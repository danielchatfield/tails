Start the Persistent Volume Assistant
=====================================

To start the persistent volume assistant, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent storage</span></span>.

<div class="note">
The error message <span class="emphasis">Error, Persistence partition is not
unlocked.</span> means that the persistent volume was not enabled from
<span class="application">Tails greeter</span>. So you can not configure it
but you can delete it and create a new one.
</div>

Creating the Persistent Volume
==============================

When run for the first time, or after [[deleting the persistent
volume|delete]], the assistant proposes to create a new persistent volume on
the USB stick from which Tails is running.

1. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.
Specify a passphrase of your choice in both the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> and <span class="guilabel">Verify
Passphrase</span> text boxes.

2. Click on the <span class="guilabel">Create</span> button.

3. Wait for the creation to finish.

<div class="bug">
<strong>If the creation is interrupted before it finishes</strong>, you may not
be able to start Tails from this USB stick any more. This can happen if you
close the window of the wizard or unplug the USB stick during the creation of
the persistent volume. [[Delete|first_steps/usb_reset]] and
[[reinstall|first_steps/usb_installation]] Tails to fix this issue.
</div>

Persistent Volume Features
==========================

When run from a USB stick that already has a persistent volume, the assistant
shows a list of the possible persistent features. Each feature corresponds to a
set a files to be saved in the persistent volume.

<div class="note">
<strong>Restart Tails to apply the changes</strong> after selecting or
unselecting one or several features.

If you unselect a feature that used to be activated, it will be
deactivated after restarting Tails but the corresponding files will
remain on the persistent volume.
