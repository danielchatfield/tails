Start the Persistent Volume Assistant
=====================================

To start the persistent volume assistant, choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">Configure persistent storage</span></span>.

<div class="note">
The error message <span class="emphasis">Error, Persistence partition is not
unlocked.</span> means that the persistent volume was not enabled from
<span class="application">Tails greeter</span>. So you can not configure it
but you can delete it and create a new one.
</div>

Creating the Persistent Volume
==============================

When run for the first time, or after [[deleting the persistent
volume|delete]], the assistant proposes to create a new persistent volume on
the USB stick from which Tails is running.

1. The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.
Specify a passphrase of your choice in both the
<span class="guilabel">Passphrase</span> and <span class="guilabel">Verify
Passphrase</span> text boxes.

2. Click on the <span class="guilabel">Create</span> button.

3. Wait for the creation to finish.

<div class="bug">
<strong>If the creation is interrupted before it finishes</strong>, you may not
be able to start Tails from this USB stick any more. This can happen if you
close the window of the wizard or unplug the USB stick during the creation of
the persistent volume. [[Delete|first_steps/usb_reset]] and
[[reinstall|first_steps/usb_installation]] Tails to fix this issue.
</div>

Persistent Volume Features
==========================

When run from a USB stick that already has a persistent volume, the assistant
shows a list of the possible persistent features. Each feature corresponds to a
set a files to be saved in the persistent volume.

<div class="note">
<strong>Restart Tails to apply the changes</strong> after selecting or
unselecting one or several features.
</div>

<div class="bug">
If you unselect a feature that used to be activated, it will be
deactivated after restarting Tails but the corresponding files will
remain on the persistent volume.

<div class="text"><h2>GNOME Keyring</h2></div>
</div>

When this feature is activated, the secrets of
<span class="application">GNOME Keyring</span> are saved in the persistent
volume.

GNOME Keyring is a collection of components in GNOME that store secrets,
passwords, keys, certificates and make them available to applications.
For more information about <span class="application">GNOME Keyring</span> see
the [official documentation](http://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring).

<a id="apt_packages"></a>

<div class="icon">
<div class="image"><img src="../synaptic.png"/></div>
<div class="text"><h2>APT Packages</h2></div>
</div>

When this feature is activated, the packages that you install using the
<span class="application">Synaptic</span> package manager or the
<span class="command">apt-get</span> command are saved in the persistent volume.

If you install additional programs, this feature allows you to download them
once and reinstall them during future working sessions, even offline.
Note that those packages are not automatically installed when restarting Tails.

If you activate this feature, it is recommended to activate the
<span class="guilabel">APT Lists</span> feature as well.

<a id="apt_lists"></a>

<div class="icon">
<div class="image"><img src="../synaptic.png"/></div>
<div class="text"><h2>APT Lists</h2></div>
</div>

When this feature is activated, the lists of all the software packages available
for installation are saved in the persistent volume.

Those so called <span class="emphasis">APT lists</span> correspond to the files
downloaded while doing
<span class="guilabel">Reload</span> from the
<span class="application">Synaptic</span> package manager or issuing the
<span class="command">apt-get update</span> command.

The <span class="emphasis">APT lists</span> are needed to install additional
programs or explore the list of available software packages. This feature allows
you to reuse them during future working sessions, even offline.

<a id="dotfiles"></a>

<div class="icon">
<div class="image"><img src="../preferences-desktop.png"/></div>
<div class="text"><h2>Dotfiles</h2></div>
</div>

When this feature is activated, all the files in the <span
class="filename">/live/persistent/XXX_unlocked/dotfiles</span> folder
are linked in the <span class="filename">Home Folder</span> (files in
subfolders of <span class="filename">dotfiles</span> are also linked
in the corresponding subfolder of your <span class="filename">Home
Folder</span>). The `XXX` in the above should be something like `sdb2`
but since there will only ever be one folder in <span
class="filename">/live/persistent</span> there should be little risk
for confusion.

This option is useful if you want to make some specific files
persistent, but not the folders they are stored in. A fine example are
the so called "dotfiles" (and hence the name of this feature), the
hidden configuration files in the root of your home directory, like
<span class="filename">~/.git</span> and <span
class="filename">~/.bashrc</span>.

<a id="custom_directory"></a>

Custom directory
----------------

With this feature you can specify other folders of your choice to be saved in
the persistent volume.

If for example you want to create and make persistent an
<span class="filename">Images</span> folder in the
<span class="filename">Home Folder</span> you can specify
<span class="filename">/home/amnesia/Images</span> as a custom directory.
