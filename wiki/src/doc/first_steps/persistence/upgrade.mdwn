XXX: here's the place where we should explain people how to have their
`live-additional-software.conf` and custom `persistence.conf` settings
enabled back.

Users are pointed to this page if
a `live-additional-software.conf.disabled` file is found, or if not
all settings could be automatically migrated from
`live-persistence.conf` to `persistence.conf`.

Users are also pointed to this page from the release notes, as
a clever enough attacker who gained root privileges previously is able
to block the migration, and the desktop notification. (But then,
things get trickier: no automated process is able to handle this case,
so the user has to apply the correct permissions, and migrate their
configuration by hand. Technical details are in
[[contribute/design/persistence#security|the persistence design
documentation]]. I don't think we can offer anything better than
"please create a new persistent volume on another storage device, and
carefully migrate your files and configuration by hand" if this case
arises in practice, which seems unlikely, so better not make the
documentation more complicated than it needs.)

Below is, hopefully, all the information the doc writers will need.
This is an operational summary of what can be done at this point; for
more advanced technical details, see the detailed plan to fix the
general issue we're tackling here, and
[[contribute/design/persistence#security|the persistence design
documentation]].

First, it may be worth mentioning *why* these files were disabled, and
(for `live-persistence.conf`) only partially imported. At least to the
extent of what the user needs to understand, that is: technically,
there is a possibility that these files have been tampered with (needs
a targetted attack against Tails, with remote arbitrary code exec as
the `amnesia` user, and persistence enabled read-write at the same
time), so their content should not be trusted.

It also may be worth mentioning that whereas we're now temporarily
running with degraded functionality, full functionality can be
restored by following this doc. Yay!

To enable things back, the user has to edit files (`persistence.conf`,
`live-additional-software.conf`) as root (or as
tails-persistence-setup), probably using gksudo gedit or something.

It's probably worth mentioning somewhere (perhaps not on this very
page, though), that `persistence.conf` and
`live-additional-software.conf` MUST have mode 0600, and be owned by
`tails-persistence-setup:tails-persistence-setup`. t-p-s creates
`persistence.conf` just fine, but well, in case people try to do
clever interesting things :)

This also means checking that the disabled content (be it a line in
`live-persistence.conf.old` or in `live-additional-software.conf`) is
safe, before importing it.

Old persistence config now is in `live-persistence.conf.old`.
New persistence config (that is, safe settings that could be imported
automatically) is in `persistence.conf`.

Old, disabled additional software config now is in
`live-additional-software.conf.disabled`. New, (empty) additional
software config now is in `live-additional-software.conf`.

To end with, when all was migrated, one should delete
`live-persistence.conf.old` and
`live-additional-software.conf.disabled` to avoid being nagged about
stuff left to migrate on next login.

Enjoy!
