XXX: here's the place where we should explain people how to have their
live-additional-software.conf and custom persistence.conf settings
enabled back.

Users are pointed to this page if
a live-additional-software.conf.disabled file is found, or if not all
settings could be migrated from live-persistence.conf to
persistence.conf.

Below is, hopefully, all the information the doc writers will need.
This is an operational summary of what can be done at this point; for
more advanced technical details, see the detailed plan to fix the
general issue we're tackling here.

First, it may be worth mentioning *why* these files were disabled, and
(for live-persistence.conf) partially imported. At least to the extent
of what the user needs to understand, that is: technically, there is
a possibility that these files have been tampered with (needs
a targetted attack against Tails, with remote arbitrary code exec as
the `amnesia` user, and persistence enabled read-write at the same
time), so their content should not be trusted.

It also may be worth mentioning that whereas we're now temporarily
running with degraded functionality, full functionality can be
restored by following this doc. Yay!

To enable things back, the user has to edit files (persistence.conf,
live-additional-software.conf) as root (or as
tails-persistence-setup), probably using gksudo gedit or something.

It's probably worth mentioning somewhere (perhaps not on this very
page, though), that persistence.conf and live-additional-software.conf
MUST have mode 0600, and be owned by
tails-persistence-setup:tails-persistence-setup. Just in case people
try to do clever interesting things :)

This also means checking that the disabled content (be it a line in
live-persistence.conf.old or in live-additional-software.conf) is
safe, before importing it.

Old persistence config now is in live-persistence.conf.old.
New persistence config (that is, safe settings that could be imported
automatically) is in persistence.conf.

Old, disabled additional software config now is in
live-additional-software.conf.disabled. New, (empty) additional
software config now is in live-additional-software.conf.

To end with, when all was migrated, one should delete
live-persistence.conf.old and live-additional-software.conf.disabled
to avoid being nagged about stuff left to migrate.

Enjoy!
