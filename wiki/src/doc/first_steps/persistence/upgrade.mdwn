[[!meta title="Upgrade to more secure persistence settings"]]

Tails 0.21 introduces a more secure access control over the persistent
volume settings. This also means that before Tails 0.21, an attacker who
could run an exploit from inside your Tails session could corrupt the
persistent volume settings. By doing this, an attacker could possibly
gain persistent administrator rights or install malicious software.

For more technical details about the security of the persistent volume,
read our [[design document|contribute/design/persistence#security]].

<div id="automatic_upgrade">

Automatic upgrade
=================

We designed a migration mechanism that allows, in most cases, to upgrade
automatically to those more secure persistent volume settings. To do
this upgrade, start Tails 0.21 or later, and enable persistence without
the read-only option. If the upgrade is successful, Tails starts as
usual and no notification appears. This upgrade is done once and for
all. Activating the read-only option prevents Tails from starting
correctly until the upgrade is made.

But this automatic upgrade might not be sufficient in some cases.

1. **If you have custom persistence settings or use
   [[additional software packages|configure#additional_software]]**, the
   corresponding settings are not upgraded automatically.

   A notification should appear when starting Tails that indicates which
   persistence settings are temporarily disabled. In that case, follow
   the instructions to [[enable again your custom persistence
   settings|upgrade#custom_settings]].

   <div class="caution">

     If you have custom persistence settings or use additional software
     but no notification appear on the desktop, then your Tails system
     might be corrupted. In that case, follow the instructions to [[manually copy
     your persistent data to a new device|upgrade#new_device]].

   </div>

1. **If you have good reasons to think that your persistence settings
   are corrupted** or if you want to be extra careful, then follow the
   instructions to [[manually copy your persistent data to a new
   device|upgrade#new_device]].

<div id="custom_settings">

Enabling again your custom persistence settings
===============================================

Custom persistence settings and additional software are disabled during
the automatic upgrade because, there is technically a possibility for
these files to be corrupted.

These instructions explain how to verify the content of these files and
enable again your custom persistence settings.

1. Start Tails and set an
   [[administration password|startup_options/administration_password]].

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Root Terminal</span>
   </span>`
   to open a terminal with administration rights.

1. Execute the <span class="code">nautilus</span> command to open the
   file browser.

1. In the file browser navigate to
   <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked</span>.

<span class="filename">live-persistence.conf.old</span>
-------------------------------------------------------

If there is a file named
<span class="filename">live-persistence.conf.old</span> in the
<span class="filename">TailsData</span> folder, then some of your
persistence settings need to be enabled manually.

1. In the file browser, right-click on the
   <span class="filename">live-persistence.conf.old</span> file and open
   it by choosing
   <span class="guilabel">Open with Other Application...</span>
   and then <span class="guilabel">gedit</span>.

1. Right-click on the <span class="filename">persistence.conf</span>
   file and choose
   <span class="guilabel">Open with Other Application...</span> and then
   <span class="guilabel">gedit</span> to open it in a new tab in
   <span class="application">gedit</span>.

1. Switch between the two tabs corresponding to those files in
   <span class="application">gedit</span>. Compare their content and
   copy from <span class="filename">live-persistence.conf.old</span> to
   <span class="filename">persistence.conf</span> the lines
   corresponding to your custom settings that have not been upgraded
   automatically.

Those missing lines should correspond to your custom directories or
other custom persistence settings.

If you detect lines in
<span class="filename">live-persistence.conf.old</span> that do not
correspond to any change that you have made, they might have been
introduced by an attacker. In this case, do the following:

1. [[Report a bug using
   <span class="application">WhisperBack</span>|bug_reporting]] and
   explain which are the lines that look suspicious to you.

1. Keep that Tails device without modifying it in order to analyse it
   later if needed.

1. Follow the instructions to [[manually copy your persistent data to a
   new device|upgrade#new_device]].

If you do not detect any suspicious line, close
<span class="application">gedit</span> and delete the
<span class="filename">live-persistence.conf.old</span> file using the
file browser.

<span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf.disabled</span>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If there is a file named
<span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf.disabled</span> in
the <span class="filename">TailsData</span> folder, then your
[[additional software|configure#additional_software]] need to be enabled
manually.

1. In the file browser, right-click on the
   <span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf.disabled</span>
   file and open it by choosing
   <span class="guilabel">Open with Other Application...</span> and then
   <span class="guilabel">gedit</span>.

1. Right-click on the
   <span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf</span> file and
   choose <span class="guilabel">Open with Other Application...</span>
   and then <span class="guilabel">gedit</span> to open it in a new tab
   in <span class="application">gedit</span>.

1. Copy from
   <span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf.disabled</span>
   to <span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf</span> the
   lines corresponding to your additional software.

If you detect lines in
<span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf.disabled</span>
that do not correspond to any additional software added by you, they
might have been introduced by an attacker. In this case, do the
following:

1. [[Report a bug using
   <span class="application">WhisperBack</span>|bug_reporting]] and
   explain which are the lines that look suspicious to you.

1. Keep that Tails device without modifying it in order to analyse it
   later if needed.

1. Follow the instructions to [[manually copy your persistent data to a
   new device|upgrade#new_device]].

If you do not detect any suspicious line, close
<span class="application">gedit</span> and delete the
<span class="filename">live-additional-software.conf.disabled</span>
file using the file browser.

<div id="new_device">

Manually copying your persistent data to a new device
=====================================================

These instructions explain how to manually copy your persistent data to
a new device. Follow them if you have good reasons to think that your
persistence settings are corrupted or if want to be extra careful.

Create a new device
-------------------

1. Install Tails 0.21 or later onto a new device using the usual
   [[installing instructions|installation]]. Do not use the Tails device
   that might be corrupted in the process of installing the new one.

1. [[Create a persistent volume|configure]] on this new device. We
   advice you to use a different passphrase to protect this new
   persistent volume.

1. Enable again on this new device the persistence features of your
   choice.

1. Restart Tails and enable persistence.

Rescue your files from the old Tails device
-------------------------------------------

1. Plug in the old Tails device from which you want to rescue your data.

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">System Tools</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Disk Utility</span>
   </span>`
   to open the <span class="application">GNOME Disk Utility</span>.

1. In the left panel, click on the device corresponding to the old Tails
   device.

1. In the right panel, click on the partition labeled as
   <span class="guilabel"Encrypted</span>. The
   <span class="guilabel">Partition Label</span> must be
   <span class="label">TailsData</span>.

1. Click on <span class="guilabel">Unlock Volume</span> to unlock the
   old persistent volume. Enter the passphrase of the old persistent
   volume and click <span class="guilabel">Unlock</span>.

1. Click on the <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span> partition that
   appears below the <span class="guilabel">Encrypted Volume</span>
   partition.

1. Click on <span class="guilabel">Mount Volume</span>. The old
   persistent volume is now mounted as
   <span class="filename">/media/TailsData</span>.

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Places</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">TailsData</span>
   </span>`
   from the top navigation bar to open the old persistent volume.

1. In the file browser, choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">File</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">New Tab</span>

   and navigate to
   <span class="filename">/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked</span> in
   this new tab.

1. Click on the <span class="guilabel">TailsData</span> tab.

1. To import a folder containing persistent data from the old persistent
   volume to the new one, drag and drop that folder onto the
   <span class="guilabel">TailsData_unlocked</span> tab. When importing
   a folder, choose to <span class="guilabel">Merge All</span> the
   folder, and <span class="guilabel">Replace All</span> files. Do not
   import a folder if you do not know what it is used for.

    - The <span class="filename">apt</span> folder corresponds to the
      <span class="guilabel">[[APT Packages|configure#apt_packages]]</span>
      and <span class="guilabel">[[APT Lists|configure#apt_lists]]</span>
      persistence features. But it requires administration rights to be
      imported and this goes beyond the scope of these instructions.
      Note that this folder does not contain personal data.
