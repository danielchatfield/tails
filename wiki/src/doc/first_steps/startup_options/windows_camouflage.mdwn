[[!meta title="Windows Camouflage"]]

If you are using a computer in public you may want to avoid attracting
unwanted attention by changing the way Tails looks into something that
resembles Microsoft Windows XP.

To activate the Windows camouflage, add the <span class="command">winxp</span>

instructions, see the documentation on [[using the <span
class="application">boot menu</span>|startup_options#boot_menu]].

This is how your Tails desktop will look like:
