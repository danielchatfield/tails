[[!meta title="Windows Camouflage"]]

If you are using a computer in public you may want to avoid attracting
unwanted attention by changing the way Tails looks into something that
resembles Microsoft Windows XP.

When Tails is starting up the Windows Camouflage can be activated in
[[<span class="application">Tails greeter</span>|startup_options#tails_greeter]]
by choosing <span class="button">Yes</span> to <span
class="button">More options?</span> and then enabling the checkbox
labelled <span class="button">Activate Microsoft Windows XP
Camouflage</span>.

This is how your Tails desktop will look like:
