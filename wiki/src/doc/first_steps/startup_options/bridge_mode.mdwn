[[!meta title="Tor Bridge Mode"]]

If you live in a country where Tor is blocked, or if you want to try
to hide the fact that you are using Tor, you may want to use
[Tor bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) (see the link
for further information about bridges and how to get them). Tails can
be started in "bridge mode" which forces Tor to only connect through
bridges (it will *never* connect to the Tor network directly). Once
Tails graphical user interface has started you will be guided to set
up bridges but you must have obtained the bridge information prior to
this and have them available (e.g. written down on a piece of paper).

To activate the Tor bridge mode, add the <span class="command">bridge</span>
boot option in the <span class="application">boot menu</span>. For detailed
instructions, see the documentation on [[using the <span
class="application">boot menu</span>|startup_options#boot_menu]].
