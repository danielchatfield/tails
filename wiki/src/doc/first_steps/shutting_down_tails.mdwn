[[!meta title="Shutting down Tails"]]

There are several ways of shutting down Tails, here are
a few ones:

* By clicking on the shutdown helper icon located on the top right
corner of the panel and choosing
<span class=\"guimenuitem\">Shutdown Immediately</span> or
<span class=\"guimenuitem\">Reboot Immediately</span>.

* By removing the device you are running Tails from (USB stick, SD card). Note
that this method [[doesn't work with DVD|support/known_issues#index11h2]].

* By pressing the power button of the computer.
