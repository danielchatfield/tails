[[!meta title="Logging in to captive portals"]]

Many publicly accessible Internet connections (usually available
through a wireless network connection) require its users to register
and login in order to get access to the Internet. This include both
free and paid for services that may be found at Internet cafÃ©s,
libraries, airports, hotels, universities etc. Normally in these
situations, a so called *captive portal* intercepts any website
request made and redirects the web browser to a login page. None of
that works when Tor is used, so a browser with unrestriced network
access is necessary. Note that this means that **the Unsafe Browser
is NOT anonymous**, so use it carefully.

Tails includes an "Unsafe Browser" for this purpose, and it can be
started via the menu: `Application -> Internet -> Unsafe
Browser`. Its red/yellow theme should make it fairly obvious that a
different (and in this case, unsafe) browser is used compared to the
normal, safe web browser included in Tails.

Security recommendations:

* While this browser can be used unrestrictively for anything, it is
  *highly* recommended to only use it for the purpose stated above,
  i.e. to access and login on captive portals.

* Do not run this browser at the same time as the normal, anonymous
  web browser. This makes it easy to not mistake one browser for the
  other, which could have catastrophic consequences.

* When using [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/windows_camouflage]]
  the red theme is disabled in order to raise less suspicion. It is
  still possible to quietly identify the Unsafe Browser since it has
  English Wikipedia as its default (and only) search engine in the
  Navigation Toolbar. The lack of the onion icon added by Torbutton
  is another such small visual reminder.
