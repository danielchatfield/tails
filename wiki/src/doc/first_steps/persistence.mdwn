[[!meta title="Persistence"]]

If you have started Tails from a USB stick, you can create a
persistent volume in the free space left on the USB stick by the <span
class="application">Tails USB installer</span>. The files in the persistent
volume are saved and remain available across separate working sessions.

You can use this persistent volume to store different kinds of files:

  - your personal files and working documents
  - the software packages that you download and install in Tails
  - the configuration of the programs you use
  - your encryption keys

The persistent volume is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase.

Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not
each time you start Tails.
