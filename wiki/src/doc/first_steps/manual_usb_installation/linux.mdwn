This technique uses the command line.

[[!toc levels=1]]

<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Install isohybrid</h2>

Under Debian or Ubuntu the `isohybrid` utility is included in the `syslinux`
package. You can do:

    apt-get install syslinux

<a id="step_2"></a>

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Find out the device name of the USB stick</h2>

**Warning!** If you are not sure about the device name it is recommended to stop
proceeding otherwise **you might risk overwriting any hard drive on the
system**.

The device name should be something like `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc.

If you're not sure about the precise device name, do the following.

Unplug the USB stick.

Open the Gnome disk utility from the menu *Applications* → *System Tools* →
*Disk Utility*:

[[!img gnome_disk_utility.png link=no alt="Applications → System Tools → Disk Utility"]]

The disk utility will list all the current storage devices on the left side of
the screen:

[[!img storage_devices.png link=no alt="Storage devices, including USB peripherals"]]

Plug back the USB stick. A new device should appear in the list of
storage devices. Select it with the cursor:

[[!img destination_device.png link=no alt="A new storage device appeared at the end of the list"]]

Check that the description of the device corresponds to your USB
stick, its brand, its size, etc. on the right side of the screen.

[[!img destination_device_description.png link=no alt="Drive description containing: 'Device: /dev/sdc'"]]

On this screenshot, the USB stick is a Kingston DataTraveler of 2.0
GB and its device name is `/dev/sdc`. Yours could be different.

<h2 class="bullet-number-three">Do the copy from the terminal</h2>

Open a terminal from the menu *Applications* → *Accessories* → *Terminal* and
issue the following command, replacing `[tails.iso]` by the path to the ISO
image that you want to copy and `[device]` by the device name found in [[step
2|linux#step_2]].

    isohybrid [tails.iso] --entry 4 --type 0x1c
    cat [tails.iso] > [device] && sync

If you are not sure about the path to the ISO image or if you get a "No such
file or directory" error, you can first type `cat`, followed by a space, and
then drag and drop the icon of the ISO image from a file browser onto the
terminal. This should insert the correct path to the ISO image in the terminal.
Then complete the command.

You should get something like this:

    isohybrid '/home/amnesia/Desktop/tails-0.6.2.iso' --entry 4 --type 0x1c
    cat '/home/amnesia/Desktop/tails-0.6.2.iso' > /dev/sdc && sync

<h2 class="bullet-number-four">Press enter and wait</h2>

If you don't see any error message, Tails is being copied onto the key. The
whole process might take some time, generally a few minutes. Be patient…

Troubleshooting
===============

### cat: /dev/sdx: No such file or directory

Then double-check the name of the device you found in [[step
2|linux#step_2]].

### cat: /dev/sdx: Permission denied

You might also have committed a mistake in the device name, so please
double-check it. If you're sure about the device name, this could be a
permission problem and you could need to gain administration privileges before running the
commands in the terminal. That could be:

    sudo su -
    isohybrid [tails.iso] --entry 4 --type 0x1c
    cat [tails.iso] > [device] && sync

### cat: tails.iso: No such file or directory

Then you surely have committed a mistake on the path to the ISO image in [[step
3|linux#step_3]].
