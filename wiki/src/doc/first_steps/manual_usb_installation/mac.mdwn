<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Setup rEFInd</h2>

You need to have [rEFInd](http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/) installed and
working on the Mac.

If you need help with rEFInd, look at [their installation
documentation](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html).

rEFInd will replace your original bootloader. If something goes wrong,
this could cause your Mac to not boot. It is recommended to create a full backup and know how to
restore. See Apple's instructions [there](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427).

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Find out the device name of the USB stick</h2>

**Warning!** If you are not sure about the device name you should not proceed or **you risk
overwriting any hard drive on the system**.

The device name should be something like `/dev/disk1`, `/dev/disk2`, etc.

If you're not sure about the precise device name, do the following.

Unplug the USB stick.

Open Terminal from *Applications* → *Utilities* → *Terminal.app*:

Type the following command:

     diskUtil list

This will list all the current storage devices:

[[!img mac/diskUtil_list_empty_small.png link=no alt="Empty list"]]

Plug back the USB stick and run the same command as before:

	 diskUtil list

A new device should appear in the list of storage devices.
Check that the size of the device corresponds to the size of your USB stick.


[[!img mac/diskUtil_list_USB_shows_small.png link=no alt="A new storage device appeared at the end of the list"]]
On this screenshot the USB drive is 4.0 GB and the location is `/dev/disk1`:
Yours could be different.

<h2 class="bullet-number-three">Unmount the USB drive</h2>

In the Terminal window issue the following command, replacing `[device]`
with the device name found in step 2.

     diskUtil unmountDisk [device]


<h2 class="bullet-number-four">Get isohybrid.pl</h2>

1. You need to modify the Tails ISO before installing it onto a USB stick.
     Download [syslinux](http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/syslinux/syslinux_4.02+dfsg.orig.tar.gz).
1. Extract (double click) the package and copy isohybrid.pl from the /utils folder to your Desktop.
1. Copy the Tails image (tails-i386-0.17.1.iso) to your Desktop.

Now in your Terminal window change directories into your `Desktop`:

	cd Desktop

Now run isohybrid.pl to prepare the Tails image.
In the Terminal window issue the following command, replacing `[tails.iso]` by the path to the ISO
image that you want to modify.

	perl isohybrid.pl [tails.iso]

If you are not sure about the path to the ISO image or if you get a "No such
file or directory" error, you can first type `perl isohybrid.pl`, followed by a space, and
then drag and drop the icon of the ISO image from a file browser onto the
Terminal. This should insert the correct path to the ISO image in the Terminal.

You should get something like this:

	perl isohybrid.pl tails-i386-0.17.1.iso

Press enter and wait until the command prompt reappears.
<h2 class="bullet-number-five">Do the copy from the Terminal.</h2>

In the Terminal window issue the following command, replacing `[tails.iso]` by the path to the ISO
image that you want to copy and `[device]` by the device name found in step
1.

	cat [tails.iso] > [device] && sync

If you are not sure about the path to the ISO image or if you get a "No such
file or directory" error, you can first type `cat`, followed by a space, and
then drag and drop the icon of the ISO image from a file browser onto the
Terminal. This should insert the correct path to the ISO image in the Terminal.
Then type the rest of the command.

You should get something like this:

    cat tails-i386-0.17.1.iso > /dev/disk1 && sync

Press enter and wait until the command prompt reappears.
If you don't see any error message, Tails is being copied onto the key. The
whole process might take a while, generally a few minutes. Be patient…

<div class="next">
<p>Once the command prompt reappears, you can reboot your Mac.
Wait for the rEFInd menu and select the USB drive to
[[start Tails|/download/#start]] from this new USB stick.</p>
</div>

Notes
=====

This method was tested on a MacBookPro Model A1150 (year 2006)
running OSX 10.6.8

Note that Tails developers are in general not very knowledgeable about
Mac. Any additional information is welcome.


An alternative method was suggested:

1. Open Disk Utility
1. Find The Drive
1. Format Tab
1. Source is ISO File
1. Destination is USB Drive
