[[!meta title="Installing onto a USB Stick or SD card"]]

Tails includes a custom installer for USB sticks and SD cards.

In order to use <span class="application">Tails Installer</span>, you need
to start Tails from another media, and clone it onto the device of your
choice, USB stick or SD card. To do that, you can either:

  - **[[Burn a Tails DVD|download#support]]** (recommended).
  - **Use another Tails USB stick or SD card**, for example from a friend.
  - **[[Manually install Tails onto another USB
    stick or SD card|installation/manual]]**, if you cannot use a DVD.

Using <span class="application">Tails Installer</span> allows you to
later **[[create a persistent volume|persistence]]** in the free space
left on the device. This requires a USB stick or SD card of **at least 4 GB**.
