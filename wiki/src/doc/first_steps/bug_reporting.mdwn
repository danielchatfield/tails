[[!meta title="Reporting Bugs"]]

Reporting bugs is a great way of helping us improving Tails.

Remember that **the more effectively you report a bug**, the more likely we are
to fix it.

Check if the bug is already known
=================================

Have a look at:

  - the [[list of known issues|support/known_issues]]
  - the [[list of known bugs|bugs]]
  - the [[list of bugs that will be fixed in the next release|bugs/pending]]

How to write a useful bug report
================================

Please read at least the _Summary_ section of the great [How to Report Bugs
Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html), by
Simon Tatham.

Use WhisperBack
===============

**WhisperBack is an application written specifically to report bugs anonymously
from inside Tails. If you are not able to use WhisperBack, see the [[special
cases|bug_reporting#special_cases]].**

WhisperBack will help you fill-up a bug report, including relevant technical
details and send it to us encrypted and through Tor.

Starting WhisperBack
--------------------

You will find a shortcut to start WhisperBack on the desktop:

[[!img report_a_bug.png link=no alt="Report a Bug shortcut on the desktop"]]

You can also start it from the menu *Applications* → *System Tools* →
*WhisperBack*.

Write the report
----------------

WhisperBack lets you give plenty of useful information about your bug:

  - **Summary** a summary of the bug, try to be short, clear and informative
  - **Name of the affected software**
  - **Exact steps to reproduce the problem**
  - **Actual result / the problem**
  - **Desired result**

[[!img whisperback.png link=no alt="WhisperBack main window"]]

You can also have a look at the technical details that will be included in the
mail. It will give us information about your hardware, your version of Tails and
the startup process.

[[!img technical_details.png link=no alt="Technical details at the bottom of the
main window"]]

About giving us an email address
--------------------------------

If you don't mind disclosing some bits of your identity to Tails developers, you
can provide an email address to let us ask more details about the bug.

Anyone who can see this reply will probably infer you are a Tails user. Time to
wonder how much you trust your Internet and mailbox providers?

Optional OpenPGP key
--------------------

You can also indicate an OpenPGP key corresponding to this email address. You
can either give:

  - a **key ID**, if the key is available on public key servers
  - a **link to the key**, if the key is available on the web
  - a **public key block**, if the key is not publicly available

Sending your report
-------------------

Once you are done writing your report, send it by clicking the *Send* button.

[[!img sending_email.png link=no alt="Sending email"]]

Once your email has been sent correctly you will get the following notification.

[[!img your_message_has_been_sent.png link=no alt="Your message has been sent"]]

Special cases
=============

You might not always be able to use WhisperBack. In those cases, you can also
send your bug report by [[email|support/talk]].

Note that if you send the report yourself, it might not be anonymous unless you
take special care (e.g. using Tor with a throw-away email account).

<a id="no_internet_access"></a>

No internet access
------------------

WhisperBack won't be able to send your bug report.

The following steps can be used as an alternative method:

1. In Tails, start WhisperBack
2. In the bug report window, expand "technical details to include"
3. Copy everything in the "debugging info" box
4. Paste it to another document (using gedit for instance)
5. Save the document on a USB stick
6. Boot into a system with Internet connection and send your report

Tails does not start
