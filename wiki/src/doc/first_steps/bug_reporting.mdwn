[[!meta title="Report bugs"]]

Reporting bugs is a great way of helping us improving Tails.

Remember that **the more effectively you report a bug**, the more likely we are
to fix it.

Check if the bug is already known
=================================

Have a look at:

  - the [[list of known issues|support/known_issues]]
  - the [[list of things to do|todo]]
  - the [[list of things that will be in the next release|todo/pending]]

How to write a useful bug report
================================

  - The first aim of a bug report is to **let the developers reproduce the
    failure**. Give them detailed instructions so that they can make it fail for
    themselves.
  - If that is not possible, try to **describe what went wrong in detail**.
    Write down the error messages, especially if they have numbers in.
  - Write **clearly and be precise**. Say what you mean, and make sure it
    cannot be misinterpreted.
  - Be ready to provide extra information if the developers need it. If they
    did not need it, they would not be asking for it.

Use WhisperBack
===============

**WhisperBack is an application written specifically to report bugs anonymously
from inside Tails. If you are not able to use WhisperBack, see the [[special
cases|bug_reporting#special_cases]].**

WhisperBack will help you fill-up a bug report, including relevant technical
details and send it to us encrypted and through Tor.

Start WhisperBack
-----------------

You will find a shortcut to start WhisperBack on the desktop:

[[!img report_a_bug.png link=no alt="Report a Bug shortcut on the desktop"]]

You can also start it from the menu *Applications* → *System Tools* →
*WhisperBack*.

Write the report
----------------

WhisperBack lets you give plenty of useful information about your bug:

  - **Summary** a summary of the bug, try to be short, clear and informative
  - **Name of the affected software**
  - **Exact steps to reproduce the problem**
  - **Actual result / the problem**
  - **Desired result**

[[!img whisperback.png link=no alt="WhisperBack main window"]]

You can also have a look at the technical details that will be included in the
mail. It will give us information about your hardware, your version of Tails and
the startup process.

[[!img technical_details.png link=no alt="Technical details at the bottom of the
main window"]]

Optional email address
----------------------

Giving us an email address allows us to contact you to clarify the
problem. But it also provides an opportunity for eavesdroppers, like
your email or Internet provider, to confirm that you are using Tails.

Optional OpenPGP key
--------------------

You can also indicate an OpenPGP key corresponding to this email address. You
can either give:

  - a **key ID**, if the key is available on public key servers
  - a **link to the key**, if the key is available on the web
  - a **public key block**, if the key is not publicly available

Send your report
----------------

Once you are done writing your report, send it by clicking the *Send* button.

Once your email has been sent correctly you will get the following
notification: <span class="guilabel">Your message has been sent</span>.

Special cases
=============

You might not always be able to use WhisperBack. In those cases, you can also
send your bug report by [[email|support/talk]] directly.

Note that if you send the report yourself, it might not be anonymous unless you
take special care (e.g. using Tor with a throw-away email account).

<a id="no_internet_access"></a>

No internet access
------------------

WhisperBack won't be able to send your bug report.

The following steps can be used as an alternative method:

1. In Tails, start WhisperBack
2. In the bug report window, expand "technical details to include"
3. Copy everything in the "debugging info" box
4. Paste it to another document (using gedit for instance)
5. Save the document on a USB stick
6. Boot into a system with Internet connection and send your report

Tails does not start
