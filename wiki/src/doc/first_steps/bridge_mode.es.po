"If you live in a country where Tor is blocked, or if you want to try to hide "
"the fact that you are using Tor, you may want to use [Tor bridges](https://"
"www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) (see the link for further information about "
"bridges and how to get them). Tails can be started in \"bridge mode\" which "
"forces Tor to only connect through bridges (it will *never* connect to the "
"Tor network directly). Once Tails graphical user interface has started you "
"will be guided to set up bridges but you must have obtained the bridge "
"information prior to this and have them available (e.g. written down on a "
"piece of paper)."

"This is currently an experimental feature that can be enabled by adding "
"\"bridge\" to the kernel cmdline: when Tails boots, select language in the "
"boot menu but press TAB instead of ENTER. Then write \"bridge\" (without "
"quotes) and press ENTER."
