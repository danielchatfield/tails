[[!meta title="Upgrade"]]

<p>Upgrading Tails is just like installing it for the first time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if you are using Tails on a DVD, just burn a new one; time to get a
	DVD-RW to ease the process?</li>
	<li>if you are using Tails on a USB stick, just install the latest version
	on it; <strong>beware</strong>: any personal data stored on the stick will be lost!</li>
</ul>

<p>The [[download]] page explains how to proceed.</p>
