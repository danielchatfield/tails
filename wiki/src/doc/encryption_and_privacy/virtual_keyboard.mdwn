[[!meta title="Using the virtual keyboard"]]

If you think that the computer that you are using is not trustworthy,
for example when using a public computer in a library, everything that
you type might be recorded by a hardware [[!wikipedia Keystroke_logging
desc="keylogger"]].

You can use the [<span
class="application">Florence</span>](http://florence.sourceforge.net/english.html)
virtual keyboard to protect you against a hardware keylogger when typing
passwords and sensitive text. To display the virtual keyboard, click on
the keyboard icon in the notification area.

<div class="caution">

There is [[!tails_ticket 5563 desc="currently"]] no virtual keyboard in
<span class="application">Tails Greeter</span>, so a hardware keylogger
could record your persistent volume passphrase or administration
password.
