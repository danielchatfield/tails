[[!meta title="Type passwords securely on an untrusted computer"]]

If an attacker had access to the computer you run Tails on, she might
have installed a piece of hardware that records every key which is
pressed on the keyboard: that's a keylogger. This kind of hardware is
quite common and known to have been already used.

To prevent against giving such a device your password or encryption
passphrase, you might want to "type" them using the mouse on a virtual
keyboard displayed on screen.

The *[Florence](http://florence.sourceforge.net/english.html)* virtual
keyboard starts automatically with Tails and is accessible by the
keyboard icon in the systray on the top right of the screen. It can be
used to safely enter passwords using the mouse when you suspect that
a hardware keylogger may be present.
