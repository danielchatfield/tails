[[!meta title="Using a virtual keyboard"]]

When using Tails on a computer you have reasons to believe is
not trustworthy (e.g. when using a public computer in a library)
you might want to avoid everything you type, including passwords,
from being recorded by a hardware
[[!wikipedia Keystroke_logging desc="keylogger"]].

To prevent against giving such a device your password or encryption
passphrase, you might want to "type" them using the mouse (or any other
pointing device) on a virtual keyboard displayed on screen.

The *[Florence](http://florence.sourceforge.net/english.html)* virtual
keyboard starts automatically with Tails
and is
[[accessible by the keyboard icon|first_steps/introduction_to_gnome_and_the_tails_desktop]]
in the systray on the top right of the screen.

It can be used to safely enter passwords using the mouse when you suspect that
a hardware keylogger may be present.

<strong>Note that there's no virtual keyboard in Tails Greeter
and therefore a hardware keylogger could get your persistent
volume passphrase and/or administration passwords. In the future,
we would like to [[!tails_ticket 5563 desc="add a virtual
keyboard to Tails Greeter"]].
