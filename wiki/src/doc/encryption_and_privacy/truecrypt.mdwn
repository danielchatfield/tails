Security considerations
=======================

Even if *TrueCrypt* looks like free software, it is not included in Debian
due to its [restrictive
license](http://www.happyassassin.net/2008/08/06/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-truecrypt/).
Also, the development is done in a closed
fashion, so even if the source code is free, we can assume than there is
not much review happening on a daily basis.

For all the above reasons, *Tails* developers do not recommend to use
*TrueCrypt*. We do include *TrueCrypt* only to allow users of the (old
and now unsupported) *Incognito* live system to access the data on
previously created media.

In the future, we would like to
[[provide proper alternatives|todo/provide_a_migration_path_from_truecrypt]]
and stop distributing *TrueCrypt*. This means that you should **not**
create new TrueCrypt media if you intend to stay with Tails in the
long run.

Using TrueCrypt in Tails
==========================

*TrueCrypt* is not enabled by default when Tails starts. In order to
use *TrueCrypt*, the following needs to be done:

- on the language selection menu, right after booting Tails, use the
  arrow keys to select the desired system language,
- press the *tab* key (often labeled â†¹), press *space*, type
  `truecrypt` and press *enter*,
- when Tails desktop is ready, you should find *TrueCrypt* in
  the *Applications* menu, under *Accessories*.
