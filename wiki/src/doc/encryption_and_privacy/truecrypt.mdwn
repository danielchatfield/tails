Security considerations
=======================
Although *TrueCrypt* looks like free software, [concerns](http://www.happyassassin.net/2008/08/06/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-truecrypt/) over
[its licence](http://www.truecrypt.org/legal/license) prevent its inclusion in Debian.
Truecrypt is also *developed* in a closed
fashion, so while the source code is freely available,
it may receive less review than might a comparable openly developed project.

For the above reasons, *Tails* developers do not recommend *TrueCrypt*.
We include *TrueCrypt* only to allow users of the (old
and now unsupported) *Incognito* live system to access the data on
previously created media.

In the future, we would like to [[!tails_ticket 5373 desc="replace
*TrueCrypt* with a compatible alternative"]]. However, there might be
some time during which that is not possible, and [[!tails_ticket 5474
desc="moving away from *TrueCrypt*"]] is the only sensible way we can
go. This means that you should **not** create new TrueCrypt media if
you intend to stay with Tails in the long run.

Using TrueCrypt in Tails
==========================

*TrueCrypt* is not enabled by default when Tails starts. In order to use
*TrueCrypt*, add the <span class="command">truecrypt</span> boot option
to the <span class="application">boot menu</span>. For detailed
instructions, see the documentation on [[using the <span
class="application">boot
menu</span>|first_steps/startup_options#boot_menu]].

Once Tails has started, to start <span
class="application">TrueCrypt</span> choose
<span class="menuchoice">
  <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guisubmenu">Accessories</span>&nbsp;▸
  <span class="guimenuitem">TrueCrypt</span></span>.
