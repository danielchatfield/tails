Security considerations
=======================
Although *TrueCrypt* looks like free software, [concerns](http://www.happyassassin.net/2008/08/06/open-letter-to-the-developers-of-truecrypt/) over
[its licence](http://www.truecrypt.org/legal/license) prevent its inclusion in Debian.
Truecrypt is also *developed* in a closed
fashion, so while the source code is freely available,
it may receive less review than might a comparable openly developed project.

For the above reasons, *Tails* developers do not recommend *TrueCrypt*.
We include *TrueCrypt* only to allow users of the (old
and now unsupported) *Incognito* live system to access the data on
previously created media.

In the future, we would like to
[[provide proper alternatives|todo/provide_a_migration_path_from_truecrypt]]
and stop distributing *TrueCrypt*. This means that you should **not**
create new TrueCrypt media if you intend to stay with Tails in the
long run.

Using TrueCrypt in Tails
==========================

*TrueCrypt* is not enabled by default when Tails starts. In order to
use *TrueCrypt*, the following needs to be done:

- in the very first menu, right after boot (with the *Tails* and *Failsafe*
  options), use the arrow keys to select *Tails*,
- press the *tab* key (often labelled â†¹), press *space*, type
  `truecrypt` and press *enter*,
- when Tails desktop is ready, you should find *TrueCrypt* in
  the *Applications* menu, under *Accessories*.
