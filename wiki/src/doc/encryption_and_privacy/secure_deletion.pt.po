"**Operating systems do not actually remove the contents of a file when it is\n"

"the command line for example.\n"

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Instead, they simply remove the file's entry from the file system directory, "
"because this requires less work and is therefore faster. The contents of the "
"file—the actual data—remain on the storage medium. The data will remain "
"there until the operating system reuses the space for new data."

"Likewise, reformatting, repartitioning or reimaging a system is not always "
"guaranteed to write to every area of the disk, though all will cause the "
"disk to appear empty or, in the case of reimaging, empty except for the "
"files present in the image, to most software."

#. type: Plain text

"Finally, even when the storage medium is overwritten, physical properties of "
"the medium may make it possible to recover the previous contents. In most "
"cases however, this recovery is not possible by just reading from the "
"storage device in the usual way, but requires using laboratory techniques "
"such as disassembling the device and directly accessing/reading from its "
"components."
