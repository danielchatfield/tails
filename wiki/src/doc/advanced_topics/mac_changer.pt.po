"First of all, you should know that all network cards, both wired and "
"wireless, have a unique identifier stored in them called their MAC "
"address. This address is actually used to address your computer on the "
"_local_ network, but it will _never_ get out on the Internet so people can "
"_not_ use it to trace you. However, other computers on the network could log "
"it which then would provide proof that your computer have been connected to "
"it. As such, this is not a concern if you are using Tails with your home "
"Internet connection as that can be linked to you any way, but if you are "
"connecting your computer to an untrusted, public wireless network you might "
"consider enabling it. It is never useful enabling this option if you are "
"using a public computer â€“ only use this if you are using a computer that can "
"be linked to you on a public network."

"The reason why this is not always enabled is that is might cause problems on "
"some networks, so if you experience network problems while it is enabled you "
"might want try disabling it."
