"First of all, you should know that all network cards, both wired and "
"wireless, have a unique identifier stored in them called their MAC address. "
"This address is actually used to address your computer on the _local_ "
"network. It will usually not go out on the Internet but some public Wi-Fi "
"connections transmit that MAC address to a central authentication server, "
"for example when logging into their service.  It is never useful enabling "
"this option if you are using a public computer â€“ only use this if you are "
"using a computer that can be linked to you on a public network."
