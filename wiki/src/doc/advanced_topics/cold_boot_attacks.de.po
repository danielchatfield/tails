"Due to how modern computing works, basically everything that you have done "
"during a session is stored in the RAM. If an attacker has physical access to "
"your computer when you are running Tails, it may enable her to recover "
"everything that have been achieved during the session, from typed texts to "
"saved files, including passwords and encryption keys.  The more recent the "
"activity, the more likely it is that it is still in the RAM."

"Furthermore, it has been shown that the data present in the RAM might be "
"recoverable for seconds or even minutes after the computer is powered off "
"using a [cold boot attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack)."

"So, what should you do when you hear an attacker knocking at your door? You "
"could just remove the USB stick or DVD you are running Tails from. It will "
"start to wipe the contents of the RAM by filling it out with random junk, "
"thus erasing everything that was stored there before, including the "
"encryption key of the encrypted storage devices you might use and the traces "
"of your session. Then you wait, possibly trying to buy valuable time by "
"barricading your door."

"As far as the authors know, cold boot attacks are not standard procedure "
"within law enforcements and similar organisations anywhere in the world yet, "
"but it might still be good to be prepared and stay on the safe side."
