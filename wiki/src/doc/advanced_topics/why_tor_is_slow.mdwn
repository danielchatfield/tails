[[!meta title="Why Tor is slow?"]]

Users often find that the Tor network is slow. This page describes some
reasons that make Tor slow. For further
explanations, see [Why Tor is so slow?](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WhySlow)


Circuits lengthen connections
=============================

Tor provides anonymity by building circuits with three
relays. So instead of
connecting directly to the destination server, a connection is made
between each relay of the circuit and this takes more time.

Furthermore, Tor tries to build
circuits with relays in different countries which make connection travel
more and appear slower.

Quality of the relays
=====================

The Tor relays are run by volunteers in a decentralized
way. So all relays are
not of the same quality. Some are big and fast, while are smaller and
slower. And also, the network could be faster it had more capacity. To improve the capacity of the Tor
network, you can either run a Tor relay by yourself or [help existing
relays](https://www.torservers.net/partners.html).

Misuse of the Tor network
=========================

Some people misuse the Tor network, sometimes willingly or sometimes
by lack of knowledge. For instance, Tor is sometimes used to conduct
[DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack). By doing
this, the Tor relays are the one who actually undergo the attack, instead of the
intended target.
Some people use [Peer to peer
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_to_peer) through Tor which is bad for
the network. If you want to use P2P, it is better to [[use
I2P|doc/anonymous_internet/i2p]].
