[[!meta title="Why Tor is slow?"]]

Users often find that the Tor network is slow. This page describes some
of the properties of the Tor network that make it slow. For further
explanations, see [Why Tor is so slow?](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WhySlow)


Circuits lengthen connections
=============================

Tor provides anonymity by building circuits with three
nodes. So instead of
connecting directly to the destination server, a connection is made
between each hop of the circuit and this takes more time.
[latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_%28engineering%29).

Furthermore, Tor tries to build
circuits with nodes in different countries which make connection travel
more and appear slower.

Quality of the nodes
====================

The nodes of the Tor network are run by volunteers in a decentralized
way. So all nodes are
not of the same quality. Some are big and fast, while are smaller and
slower. And also, the network could be faster it had more capacity. To improve the capacity of the Tor
network, you can either run a Tor relay by yourself or [help existing
node](https://www.torservers.net/partners.html).

Misuse of the Tor network
=========================

Some people misuse the Tor network, sometimes willingly or sometimes
by lack of knowledge. For instance, Tor is sometimes used to conduct
[DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack). By doing
this, the Tor relays are the one who actually undergo the attack, instead of the
intended target.
Some people use [Peer to peer
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_to_peer) through Tor which is bad for
the network. If you want to use P2P, it is better to [[use
I2P|doc/anonymous_internet/i2p]].
