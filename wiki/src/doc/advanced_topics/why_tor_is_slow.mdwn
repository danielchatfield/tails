[[!meta title="Why Tor is slow?"]]

Finding the Tor network slow is a very common opinion in Tor community
and Tails' users frequently ask for explanations. There are many things
that combined together slow the Tor network down, here are a few ones that are
quite easy to get without a deep knowledge in network. In you want further
explanations, see [Why Tor is so slow?](https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WhySlow)

Circuits lengthen connections
=============================

As you may know, Tor provides anonymity in building circuits with three
nodes. So when you use Tor and you tried to reach a server, instead of
having only one connection between you and the server, there are 3
connections which add
[latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_%28engineering%29). As
Tor's anonymity relies in part of the circuits, Tor tries to build
circuits with nodes in different countries which make connection travel
more. This adds another little time.

Node's quality
==============

Tor's nodes are run by volunteer in a decentralized way so nodes are
not the same quality. Some move huge quantities of data with little
latency, while others only move little amount of data with more
latency. Tor lacks capacity too. To improve the capacity of the Tor
network, you can either run a Tor relay by yourself or [help existing
node](https://www.torservers.net/partners.html).

Tor network's misuse
====================

Some people abuse the Tor network, sometimes willingly or sometimes
just because a lack of knowledge. For instance, they use Tor to conduct
[DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack). Doing
this, instead of attacking the target, it's the nodes who undergo the
attack. Some Tor users use it to use to [Peer to peer
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_to_peer) which is bad for
the Tor network. If you want to use P2P, rather [[use
I2P|doc/anonymous_internet/i2p]].
