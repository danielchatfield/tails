[[!meta title="Unblock a wireless device"]]

When Tails starts it unblocks Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, WWAN and WiMAX
devices.

It also blocks all other kinds of wireless devices such as GPS and FM
ones. So, if you want to use one such device, you need to unblock
it first.

This technique uses the command line.

[[!toc levels=1]]

<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Set up an administration password</h2>

Start Tails and [[set up an administration
password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]].

<a id="step_2"></a>

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Find out the index of the wireless device</h2>

Open a [[root
terminal|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password#open_root_terminal]].

Execute the following command in the root terminal:

	rfkill list

The output should be something vaguely similar to:

	0: phy0: Wireless LAN
	        Soft blocked: no
	        Hard blocked: no
	1: hci0: Bluetooth
	        Soft blocked: no
	        Hard blocked: no
 	2: gps0: GPS
	        Soft blocked: yes
	        Hard blocked: no

The device index is the number that starts the relevant device's
three-lines section. In this example, the index of the Bluetooth
device is 1, while the index of the GPS device is 2. Yours are
probably different.

<h2 class="bullet-number-three">Unblock the wireless device</h2>

Execute the following command in the root terminal, replacing
`[index]` with the index found at [[step 2|wireless#step_2]]:

	rfkill unblock [index]

Here is an example of the command to execute, yours is probably
different:

	rfkill unblock 2

<h2 class="bullet-number-four">Verify that the wireless device was unblocked</h2>

Execute the following command in the root terminal again:

	rfkill list

This output should be very similar to the one seen at step 2, with one
difference: the device unblocked at step 3 should not be soft
blocked anymore.

In this example, the output would be:

	0: phy0: Wireless LAN
	        Soft blocked: no
	        Hard blocked: no
	1: hci0: Bluetooth
	        Soft blocked: no
	        Hard blocked: no
 	2: gps0: GPS
	        Soft blocked: no
	        Hard blocked: no

Yours is probably different.
