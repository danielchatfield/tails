"Certain users might not want to restart the computer every time they wish to "
"use the Internet anonymously with Tails. For those, a so called [virtual "
"machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)  can be used to run "
"Tails inside the \"host\" operating system installed on the computer (e.g. "
"Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, etc.).  Essentially these programs emulate real "
"computers that you can run \"guest\" operating systems (in this case Tails) "
"in so they appear in a window within the host operating system. Using one of "
"these technologies allows for convenient access to Tails's features in a "
"protected environment while you at the same time have access to your normal "
"operation system."
