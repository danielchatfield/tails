"You should NOT trust Windows to be secure if you use Tails for anything you "
"consider risky. Windows could be made a tiny bit more trustworthy if you "
"installed a HIPS (Host Intrusion Prevention System)  with high security "
"settings instantly after installing Windows. If Windows not is installed "
"from a genuine Windows CD/DVD you can not trust it enough, not even if it's "
"a preinstalled copy of Windows (there have been cases of computers being "
"shipped with malware). If you install a HIPS first after using Windows for "
"some time (less then an hour online is enough) you could already have a "
"rootkit that the HIPS can't detect. Even with a HIPS you should not use "
"Windows as a host OS if you risk personal harm for your use of Tails."

"Tails runs in [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) without any major "
"configuration necessary. VirtualBox is distributed both as a closed-source "
"and as an open-source (the so called OSE or Open Source Edition), the latter "
"which the Tails developer's encourages (although it currently lacks USB "
"support compared to the closed-source version)."
