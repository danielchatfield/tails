"Thanks to QEMU, Tails can be run within Microsoft Windows without the need "
"to restart the computer. QEMU ships with Tails, and is set up so you only "
"have to insert the media when Windows is running and a menu should appear "
"with the option to start Tails through it. This is especially useful when "
"you are using a computer you are not allowed to shut-down, which can be the "
"case for public computers in certain Internet caf√©s, libraries or other "
"public computers. Also, for some some general remarks on QEMU and Tails, and "
"some security concerns about this mode of operation, see the above section "
"on [[virtualization]]."
