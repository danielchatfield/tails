[[!meta title="Running Tails from within Microsoft Windows"]]

**FIXME**: This section have not been adapted from old incognito documentation
now so please do not take it into account. It is currently possible to start
Tails under Windows with QEMU.

Thanks to QEMU, Tails can be run within
Microsoft Windows without the need to restart the computer. QEMU ships
with Tails, and is set up so you only have to insert the media when
Windows is running and a menu should appear with the option to start
Tails through it. This is especially useful when you are using a
computer you are not allowed to shut-down, which can be the case for
public computers in certain Internet caf√©s, libraries or other public
computers. Also, for some some general remarks on QEMU and Tails,
and some security concerns about this mode of operation, see the above
section on [[virtualization]].

Since the Tails developers do not have access to any Windows
computers at the moment, any input if this actually works and how it
performs etc. is welcome.
