[[!meta title="Protection against cold boot attacks"]]

When using a computer, everything done during a session is stored in
RAM: texts, saved files, but also passwords and encryption keys.The more
recent the activity, the more likely it is that it is still in RAM.
Those data can still be in RAM up to several minutes after the computer
is powered off.

A physical access to the computer you used may enable to recover everything
you've been achieving during the session. Those data can be recovered using
a <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia Cold_boot_attack desc="cold boot attack"]]
</span>. That's why when shutting down Tails, RAM is filled out with
random data, thus erasing every traces from what you did on and only on that computer.

That being said, on some computers [[Tails may not erase all the system memory
on shutdown|support/known_issues#index9h2]] or [[fails to completely shutdown
or restart|support/known_issues#index13h2]] which does not guarantee that the
memory has been wiped entirely. 

Moreover, a physical access to the computer you're using Tails on, enable as
well recovering data from RAM. In order to avoid such recovery, use
[[Tails shutdown tools|doc/first_steps/shutting_down_tails]].

As far as we know, cold boot attacks are not standard procedure for data
recovery, but it might still be good to be prepared.
