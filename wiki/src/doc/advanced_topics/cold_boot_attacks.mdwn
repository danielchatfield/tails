[[!meta title="Protection against cold boot attacks"]]

Due to how modern computing works, basically everything that you have
done during a session is stored in the RAM. If an attacker has
physical access to your computer when you are running Tails, it may
enable her to recover everything that have been achieved during the
session, from typed texts to saved files, including passwords and
encryption keys.  The more recent the activity, the more likely it is
that it is still in the RAM.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the data present in the RAM might be
recoverable for seconds or even minutes after the computer is powered
off using a [cold boot
attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack).

In both cases the RAM contents can be analysed in a computer forensics
laboratory which might turn into a major disaster depending on what they
find.

So, what should you do when you hear an attacker knocking at your door?
You could just remove the USB stick or DVD you are running Tails from. It
will start to wipe the contents of the RAM by filling it out with random
junk, thus erasing everything that was stored there before, including
the encryption key of the encrypted storage devices you might use and
the traces of your session. Then you wait, possibly trying to buy
valuable time by barricading your door.

As far as the authors know, cold boot attacks are not standard
procedure within law enforcements and similar organisations anywhere
in the world yet, but it might still be good to be prepared and stay
on the safe side.
