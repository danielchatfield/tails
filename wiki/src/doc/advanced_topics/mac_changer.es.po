"If you paid attention when you started up Tails you may have noticed an odd "
"option in the language selection menu, namely the \"Enable MAC changer\" "
"entry. Some further explanation is probably required in order to understand "
"whether this is relevant for you or not."

"First of all, you should know that all network cards, both wired and "
"wireless, have a unique identifier stored in them called their MAC address. "
"This address is actually used to address your computer on the _local_ "
"network, but it will _never_ get out on the Internet so people can _not_ use "
"it to trace you. However, other computers on the network could log it which "
"then would provide proof that your computer have been connected to it. As "
"such, this is not a concern if you are using Tails with your home Internet "
"connection as that can be linked to you any way, but if you are connecting "
"your computer to an untrusted, public wireless network you might consider "
"enabling it. It is never useful enabling this option if you are using a "
"public computer â€“ only use this if you are using a computer that can be "
"linked to you on a public network."

"The reason why this is not always enabled is that is might cause problems on "
"some networks, so if you experience network problems while it is enabled you "
"might want try disabling it."
