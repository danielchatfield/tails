[[!meta title="Enable MAC Changer"]]

**FIXME**: This section have not been adapted now. Macchanger is not easily
usable in Tails now (0.7.2)

If you paid attention when you started up Tails you may have noticed
an odd option in the language selection menu, namely the "Enable MAC
changer" entry. Some further explanation is probably required in order
to understand whether this is relevant for you or not.

First of all, you should know that all network cards, both wired and
wireless, have a unique identifier stored in them called their MAC
address. This address is actually used to address your computer on the
_local_ network, but it will _never_ get out on the Internet so people
can _not_ use it to trace you. However, other computers on the network
could log it which then would provide proof that your computer have
been connected to it. As such, this is not a concern if you are using
Tails with your home Internet connection as that can be linked to
you any way, but if you are connecting your computer to an untrusted,
public wireless network you might consider enabling it. It is never
useful enabling this option if you are using a public computer â€“ only
use this if you are using a computer that can be linked to you on a
public network.

The reason why this is not always enabled is that is might cause
problems on some networks, so if you experience network problems while
it is enabled you might want try disabling it.
