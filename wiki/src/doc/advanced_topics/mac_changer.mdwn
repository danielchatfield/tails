First of all, you should know that all network cards, both wired and
wireless, have a unique identifier stored in them called their MAC
address. This address is actually used to address your computer on the
_local_ network. It will usually not go out on the Internet but some
public Wi-Fi connections transmit that MAC address to a central
authentication server, for example when logging into their service.
It is never
useful enabling this option if you are using a public computer â€“ only
use this if you are using a computer that can be linked to you on a
public network.

The reason why this is not always enabled is that is might cause
problems on some networks, so if you experience network problems while
it is enabled you might want try disabling it.
