<h3>Using Firefox</h3>

<p>This technique is not using the cryptographic signature as the others
do. We propose it because it's especially easy for Windows users.</p>

<p>Install the CheckIt extension for Firefox available <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/checkit/">here</a>
and restart Firefox.</p>

<p>Here is the checksum (a kind of digital fingerprint) of the ISO
image. Select it with your cursor:</p>

<pre>[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_hash" raw="yes"]]</pre>

<p>Right-click on it and choose "Selected hash (SHA256)" from the
contextual menu:</p>

<p>[[!img selected_hash.png alt="Selected hash (SHA256)" link="no"]]</p>

<p>From the dialog box that shows up, open the ISO image. Then wait for
the checksum to compute. This will take several seconds during which
your browser will be unresponsive.</p>

<p><strong>If the ISO image is correct</strong> you will get a
notification saying that the checksums match:</p>

<p>[[!img checksums_match.png alt="CheckIt: SHA256 checksums match!"
link="no"]]</p>

<p><strong>If the ISO image is not correct</strong> you will get a
notification telling you that the checksums do not match:</p>

<p>[[!img checksums_do_not_match.png alt="SHA256 checksums do not match!"
link="no"]]</p>

<h3>Using the cryptographic signature</h3>

<p>GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions
and graphical frontends for both Windows and Mac OS X. This also make it
possible to check the cryptographic signature with those operating
systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[[Gpg4win|http://www.gpg4win.org/]], for Windows</li>
  <li>[[GPGTools|http://www.gpgtools.org/]], for Mac OS X</li>
</ul>

<p>You will find on either of those websites detailed documentation on
how to install and use them.</p>

<h3>For Windows using Gpg4win</h3>

<p>After installing Gpg4win, download Tails signing key:</p>

[[!inline pages="lib/download_tails_signing_key" raw="yes"]]

<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import
it|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html]]</p>

<p>Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the ISO
image you want to verify:</p>

[[!inline pages="lib/download_stable_i386_iso_sig" raw="yes"]]

<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the
signature|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4]]</p>

<h3>For Mac OS X using GPGTools</h3>

<p>After installing GPGTools, you should be able to follow the instruction for
[[Linux with the command line|verify_the_iso_image_using_the_command_line]]. To
open the command line, navigate to your Applications folder, open Utilities, and
double click on Terminal.</p>
