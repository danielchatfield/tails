[[!meta title="Emailing with Thunderbird"]]

**FIXME**: This section have not been adapted now so please do not take it into
account. Tails uses Claws Mail instead of Thunderbird.

Not everyone is happy using webmail (like the authors) but want to use
a _real_ email client instead of some fragile web-based interface. For
that we have included Mozilla Thunderbird which looks like this:

<center><a href="tb-main.jpg"><img border="0" height="305"
src="tb-main.jpg" width="453" /></a></center>

Composing email looks like this:

<center><a href="tb-compose.jpg"><img border="0" height="257"
src="tb-compose.jpg" width="324" /></a></center>

Notice that there are buttons for PGP encryption in both of the above
windows (labelled with "Decrypt" and "OpenPGP"). These are provided by
the [Enigmail](http://http://enigmail.mozdev.org/) extension, and
pressing any of them for the first time will start a guide for setting
up PGP, possibly generating new keys if you do not have any. Their web
site is a great resource for learning how PGP encryption works so make
sure to check it out.

Setting up your email account requires a tiny amount of knowledge,
like what [POP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol),
[IMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP) and
[SMTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP) is, and indeed that your
email service supports these. [This step-by-step
guide](http://opensourcearticles.com/articles/thunderbird_15/english/part_01)
might be useful. However, this initial configuration requires writing
down the addresses of the servers involved, downloading mail, etc.
which will take some time. It is a bit annoying to have to redo
everytime you start Tails, which is necessary when running from a
DVD, so you might want to consider using a persistent home directory by
[running from USB](#usb) if you plan to use Thunderbird often. One
more thing to consider is that Tor exit nodes usually block the
plaintext SMTP port (25) in order to prevent spam. This is easily
fixed by enabling end-to-end encryption with the email server through
SSL, which you should do any way for all of POP, IMAP and SMTP as your
password otherwise will be sent in plaintext.
