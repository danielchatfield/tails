"Notice that there are buttons for PGP encryption in both of the above windows "
"(labelled with \"Decrypt\" and \"OpenPGP\"). These are provided by the "
"[Enigmail](http://http://enigmail.mozdev.org/) extension, and pressing any of "
"them for the first time will start a guide for setting up PGP, possibly "
"generating new keys if you do not have any. Their web site is a great "
"resource for learning how PGP encryption works so make sure to check it out."

"Setting up your email account requires a tiny amount of knowledge, like what "
"[POP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol), [IMAP](http://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP) and [SMTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP) is, "
"and indeed that your email service supports these. [This step-by-step guide]"
"(http://opensourcearticles.com/articles/thunderbird_15/english/part_01)  "
"might be useful. However, this initial configuration requires writing down "
"the addresses of the servers involved, downloading mail, etc.  which will "
"take some time. It is a bit annoying to have to redo everytime you start "
"Tails, which is necessary when running from a DVD, so you might want to "
"consider using a persistent home directory by [running from USB](#usb) if you "
"plan to use Thunderbird often. One more thing to consider is that Tor exit "
"nodes usually block the plaintext SMTP port (25) in order to prevent spam. "
"This is easily fixed by enabling end-to-end encryption with the email server "
"through SSL, which you should do any way for all of POP, IMAP and SMTP as "
"your password otherwise will be sent in plaintext."
