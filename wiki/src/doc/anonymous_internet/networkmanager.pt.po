"The name is quite self-explanatory â€“ this is what you should use to manage "
"your network, which usually only consists of establishing an Internet "
"connection. In many cases this is done more or less automatically. For "
"example, if you are connected with wire, NetworkManager will try to obtain "
"network access automatically. If you want to connect via wireless with a "
"supported wireless adapter, you are basically two clicks away."
