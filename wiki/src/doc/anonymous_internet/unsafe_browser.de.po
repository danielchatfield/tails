"Many publicly accessible Internet connections (usually available through a "
"wireless network connection) require its users to register and login in "
"order to get access to the Internet. This include both free and paid for "
"services that may be found at Internet cafÃ©s, libraries, airports, hotels, "
"universities etc. Normally in these situations, a so called *captive portal* "
"intercepts any website request made and redirects the web browser to a login "
"page. None of that works when Tor is used, so a browser with unrestriced "
"network access is necessary. Note that this means that **the Unsafe Browser "
"is NOT anonymous**, so use it carefully."

"Tails includes an \"Unsafe Browser\" for this purpose, and it can be\n"
"started via the menu: `Application -> Internet -> Unsafe\n"
"Browser`. Its red/yellow theme should make it fairly obvious that a\n"
"different (and in this case, unsafe) browser is used compared to the\n"
"normal, safe web browser included in Tails.\n"

"When using [[doc/first_steps/startup_options/windows_camouflage]] the red "
"theme is disabled in order to raise less suspicion. It is still possible to "
"quietly identify the Unsafe Browser since it has English Wikipedia as its "
"default (and only) search engine in the Navigation Toolbar. The lack of the "
"onion icon added by Torbutton is another such small visual reminder."
