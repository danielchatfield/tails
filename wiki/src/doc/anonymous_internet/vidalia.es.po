"Lastly Vidalia will assist you setting up yourself as a Tor server, helping "
"out the Tor Network by relaying other people's traffic. You also have the "
"possibility to act as an exit node, which means that other Tor users' traffic "
"will exit in the clear from your computer.  You should really think through "
"if you want to do the latter (act as an exit node) as your ISP might start "
"sending you complaints for other people's file sharing traffic that happens "
"to exit from you, and potentially even worse things that might attract the "
"attention of the police. But simply relaying traffic is completely safe and "
"will only cost you some bandwidth (how much can be configured). However, at "
"the same time you will get more anonymity – it will be impossible for "
"eavesdroppers to distinguish the Tor traffic you are relaying from your own "
"traffic generated by web browsing etc. So if you have bandwidth to spare, you "
"might want to consider doing this."

"In order to succeed with setting up a relay you might have to do something "
"about your firewall or router if you have one, like enable port-forwarding "
"for ports 9001 and 9030 – if you do not know what this is or how to do it you "
"should either look it up on with favourite search engine or simply skip it. "
"The next step would be to actually enable it in Vidalia, which only requires "
"a few clicks. First click the *settings* option in the systray menu, then go "
"to the *Sharing* tab of the new window. There you can choose wether you want "
"to setup a normal Tor relay or a Tor [bridge](https://www.torproject.org/"
"bridges.html). In any case, you'll have to choose a nickname and a contact "
"email in the newly appeared form. Other tabs of this form helps you to choose "
"if you want to limit bandwith usage and the kind of trafic your relay will be "
"used to."
