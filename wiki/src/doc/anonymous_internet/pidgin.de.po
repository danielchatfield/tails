"For instant messaging Tails includes the [Pidgin Instant Messenger](http://"
"pidgin.im/).  It is a multi-protocol client, so you can run MSN, ICQ, IRC, "
"AIM, Jabber and many other protocols at the same time, even with several "
"instances of the same protocol."

"Of course the issue of end-to-end encryption arises again. As we mentioned "
"earlier, we have [Off-the-record messaging](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr) "
"(commonly called OTR) for instant messaging, and Pidgin and many other "
"instant messengers have support for that. There are several resources on how "
"it works and how to use it on their web site. Basically all you need to do "
"is choose \"Start private conversation\" in the OTR menu and a key will be "
"generated automatically if you do not have one already. After that OTR will "
"establish a private conversation if the other end's instant messenger "
"supports it."

"OTR and other Pidgin plugins are enabled in the \"Tools menu -&gt; Plug-ins"
"\" section. Simply check the appropriate box for enabling any plugin you "
"want, and possibly you might also want to configure it by pressing the "
"\"Configure Plug-in\" button. When this is done for the OTR plugin a window "
"that can be used to manage your keys will open.  The use of OTR is "
"recommended as many instant messaging protocols normally sends your messages "
"in plaintext. Force your friends to migrate to clients with support for OTR!"
