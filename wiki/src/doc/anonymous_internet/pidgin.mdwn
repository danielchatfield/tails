[[!meta title="Chatting with Pidgin"]]

For instant messaging Tails includes the [Pidgin Instant
Messenger](http://pidgin.im/).
It is a multi-protocol client, so you can run IRC and Jabber at the
same time, even with several instances of the same protocol.

For more detailed documentation refer to the [official Pidgin user
guide](http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin).

## OTR encryption

Of course the issue of end-to-end encryption arises again. As we
mentioned earlier, we have [Off-the-record
messaging](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr) (commonly called OTR) for
instant messaging, and Pidgin and many other instant messengers have
support for that. There are several resources on how it works and how
to use it on their web site. Basically all you need to do is choose
"Start private conversation" in the OTR menu and a key will be
generated automatically if you do not have one already. After that OTR
will establish a private conversation if the other end's instant
messenger supports it.

OTR and other Pidgin plugins are enabled in the "Tools menu -&gt;
Plug-ins" section. Simply check the appropriate box for enabling any
plugin you want, and possibly you might also want to configure it by
pressing the "Configure Plug-in" button. When this is done for the OTR
plugin a window that can be used to manage your keys will open.
The use of OTR is recommended as many instant messaging protocols
normally sends your messages in plaintext. Force your friends to
migrate to clients with support for OTR!

**FIXME**: mention `/me` is **not** encrypted when used in a OTR
private conversation.

OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/index.php#docs).

## Adding support for another protocol

For security reasons, Pidgin was slimmed down in Tails to only support
IRC and Jabber. Here are the prerequisites to add support for another
protocol that Pidgin upstream supports:

a. Pidgin's support for this protocol has been successfully tested
   in Tails.
a. Someone volunteers to maintain the corresponding support in Tails
   on the long term.
a. Someone has verified that the security record of the desired plugin
   (including open bugs) does not seem too scary.
