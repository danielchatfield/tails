[[!meta title="Chatting with Pidgin"]]

For instant messaging Tails includes the <span class="application">[Pidgin Instant
Messenger](http://pidgin.im/)</span>.
It is a multi-protocol client, so you can run IRC and Jabber at the
same time, even with several instances of the same protocol.

For more detailed documentation refer to the [official <span
class="application">Pidgin</span> user
guide](http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin).

## <span class="application">Off-the-record</span> (<span class="application">OTR</span>) encryption

As explained on its [official page](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/),
<span class="application">Off-the-Record</span> messaging allows you to
have private conversations over instant messaging by providing:

- **Encryption**</br>
    No one else can read your instant messages.
- **Authentication**</br>
    You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
- **Deniability**</br>
    The messages you send do not have digital signatures
    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you.
    However, during a conversation, your correspondent is assured
    the messages he sees are authentic and unmodified.
- **Perfect forward secrecy**</br>
    If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation is compromised.

To learn how to use OTR with <span class="application">Pidgin</span>,
refer to the documentation from Security in-a-box: [How to Use OTR to
Initiate a Secure Messaging Session in
Pidgin](https://securityinabox.org/en/pidgin_securechat).

<div class="caution">

In a private OTR conversation over IRC, <strong>a message sent using the
<code>/me</code> command is not encrypted</strong>. The person receiving
the message is notified by a warning.

## Adding support for another protocol

For security reasons, Pidgin was slimmed down in Tails to only support
IRC and Jabber. Here are the prerequisites to add support for another
protocol that Pidgin upstream supports:

a. Pidgin's support for this protocol has been successfully tested
   in Tails.
a. Someone volunteers to maintain the corresponding support in Tails
   on the long term.
a. Someone has verified that the security record of the desired plugin
   (including open bugs) does not seem too scary.
