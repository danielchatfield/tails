[[!meta title="Could not determine whether an upgrade is available"]]

Tails could not determine whether an upgrade is available.

This is probably caused by a network problem. Restart Tails. If this
error happens again, [[report an error|support/troubleshooting]]
including the complete error message.

Other possible causes for this failure are attacks by an adversary who
is controlling either the Tor exit node being used, or the
<https://tails.boum.org> web server, or anything in-between:

* Endless data attacks
* Slow retrieval attacks

Read the [[security
discussion|contribute/design/incremental_upgrades#security]] about
incremental upgrades for details.
