[[!meta title="Error while checking for upgrades"]]

Tails could not determine whether an upgrade is available from our website.

This is probably caused by a network connection problem.

<div class="bug">

<p>In Tails 0.22.1, <span class="application">Tails Upgrader</span> sometimes
fails to check for upgrades even if the computer is correctly connected to
Internet because it starts before Tor is ready. In this case, try to do the
upgrade from another network or another computer.</p>

</div>

Check your network connection, and restart Tails to check for upgrades again.

If the problem persists, [[report an error|support/troubleshooting]] and include
in your report the debugging information that appears in the error message.

This error could also be caused by:

  - an error in Tails Upgrader
  - a failure or an attack on the Tor exit node being used, your Internet
    service provider, or our website.

Sending us a report is the best way to further analyse the error.
