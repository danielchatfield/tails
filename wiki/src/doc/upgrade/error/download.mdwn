[[!meta title="Could not download the upgrade"]]

The upgrade could not be downloaded.

This is probably caused by a network problem. Restart Tails. If this
error happens again, [[report an error|support/troubleshooting]]
including the complete error message.

Other possible causes for this failure are attacks by an adversary who
is controlling either the Tor exit node, or the web mirror being used,
or anything in-between:

* Endless data attacks
* Slow retrieval attacks
* Malicious mirror preventing upgrades (missing or corrupted files,
  misconfiguration, etc.)

Read the [[security
discussion|contribute/design/incremental_upgrades#security]] about
incremental upgrades for details.
