"Trust is a very problematic issue, and that's the essence of why security is "
"difficult in every field, including computers and Internet communication. Do "
"you trust Tails and its developers? Do you think we have planted backdoors in "
"Tails so we can take control of your computer, or that we make Tails generate "
"compromised encryption keys in order to enable the government to spy on you? "
"Do you simply trust our word on that we are legit?"

"No matter what your opinion is in this matter you should ask how you reached "
"that conclusion. Both trust and distrust need to be established based on "
"facts, not gut feeling, paranoid suspicion, unfounded hearsay or our word. Of "
"course, we claim to be honest, but written assurances are worthless. In order "
"to make an informed decision you must look at the greater picture of what "
"Tails is comprised of, our affiliations, and possibly how others trust us."

"Free software, [[like Tails|about/license]], enables its users to check "
"exactly what the software distribution consists of and how it functions since "
"the source code must be made available to all who receive it. Hence a "
"thorough audit of the code can reveal if any malicious code, like a backdoor, "
"is present. Furthermore, with the source code it is possible to build the "
"software, and then compare the result against any version that is already "
"built and being distributed, like the Tails ISO images [[you can download from "
"us|download]]. That way it can be determined whether the distributed version "
"actually was built with the source code, or if any malicious changes have "
"been made."

"Of course, most people do not have the knowledge, skills or time required to "
"do this, but due to public scrutiny anyone can have a certain degree of "
"implicit trust in Free software, at least if it is popular enough that other "
"developers look into the source code and do what was described in the "
"previous paragraph. After all, there is a strong tradition within the Free "
"software community to publicly report serious issues that are found within "
"software."

"The vast majority of all software shipped in Tails comes from the [[Debian "
"GNU/Linux distribution|http://www.debian.org/]]. Debian is arguably the Linux "
"distribution whose software packages are under the deepest public scrutiny. "
"Not only is Debian itself one of the largest Linux distros, but it's also one "
"of the most popular distros to make derivatives from. Ubuntu Linux, for "
"instance, is a Debian derivative, and the same goes transitively for all of "
"its derivatives, like Linux Mint. Thus there are countless people using "
"Debian's software packages, and countless developers inspect their integrity. "
"Very serious security issues have been discovered (like the infamous [[Debian "
"SSH PRNG vulnerability|https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/"
"msg00152.html]]), but backdoors or other types of intentionally placed "
"security holes have never been found to our knowledge."

"Tails anonymity is based on Tor, which is developed by [[The Tor Project|"
"https://www.torproject.org/]]. The development of Tor is under a lot of "
"public scrutiny both academically (research on attacks and defenses on onion "
"routing) and engineering-wise (Tor's code has gone through several external "
"audits, and many independent developers have read through the sources for "
"other reasons). Again, security issues have been reported, but nothing "
"malicious like a backdoor -- we would argue that it's only uninformed "
"conspiracy theorists that speculate about deliberate backdoors in Tor these "
"days. Furthermore, Tor's distributed trust model makes it hard for a single "
"entity to capture an individual's traffic and effectively identify them."

"One could say that Tails is the union of Debian and Tor. What we do, "
"essentially, is gluing it all together. Hence, if you trust Debian and The "
"Tor Project, what remains to establish trust for Tails is to trust our \"glue"
"\". As has been mentioned, Tails is Free software, so its source code is "
"completely open for inspection, and it's mainly comprised by a specification "
"of which Debian software packages to install, and how they should be "
"configured. While Tails surely doesn't get the same amount of attention as "
"Debian or Tor, we do have some eyes on us from especially the Tor community, "
"and also some of the general security community (see our [[audits page|"
"security/audits]]).  Given that Tails' source code is comparably small and "
"devoid of complexities, we're in a pretty good spot compared to many other "
"projects of similar nature. Our [[specification and design document|"
"contribute/design]] is a good starting point to understand how Tails works, "
"by the way."
