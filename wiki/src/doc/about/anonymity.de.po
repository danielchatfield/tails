"As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of "
"steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of mass "

"Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the State, "
"the police and global surveillance systems like [ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/ECHELON) (which is _not_ a conspiracy theory; see [this report from "

"This is possible since all messages sent over the Internet contain the [IP "
"addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of both the sender and "
"receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal system contains "
"addresses of both sender and receiver for two-ways communication. IP "
"addresses can easily be traced back to the physical location of the computers "
"and their owners, and from that ultimately back to you."
