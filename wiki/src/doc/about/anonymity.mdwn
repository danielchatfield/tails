[[!meta title="About Tails anonymity"]]

# <a name="why"></a>Why do you need anonymity?

As you are probably aware of, we currently find ourselves in a state of
steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of
mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see [this report
from Privacy
International](http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-559597)).

Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the
State, the police and global surveillance systems like
[ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) (which is _not_ a
conspiracy theory; see [this report from the European
Parliament](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf))
can record what you do online: what you read, what you write and who
you communicate with.

This is possible since all messages sent over
the Internet contain the [IP
addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of both the sender
and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal
system contains addresses of both sender and receiver for two-ways
communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical
location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately
back to you.

If you do not mind this fact, then more power to you, but if you do
mind, then Tails might be just what you need.

Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the
Internet can be read by many computers that relay them.
