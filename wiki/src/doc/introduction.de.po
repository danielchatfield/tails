"It is quite long so you might want to not read it in one go but instead read "
"[[about]], [[about/warning]] and the [[conclusion]], as well as the sections "

"If you have experience with these applications and concepts from elsewhere "
"and feel comfortable with the user interface in general, reading this "

"to alter the network, proxy and firewall settings unless you know what you "
"are doing â€“ poking around with them too much might spoil the built-in "
"defences of Tails."
