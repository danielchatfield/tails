The display of syslinux menu gets corrupted when editing the command-line. It is long enough to spread on several lines, but any edit will make the command line repeat itself. While this still allows to do proper changes, it is quite annoying.

The issue looks close to the [one that was fixed in the debian-installer](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=650979) in a few months ago. So it looks to be mostly a matter of adjusting a few numbers in `menu.cfg`.
