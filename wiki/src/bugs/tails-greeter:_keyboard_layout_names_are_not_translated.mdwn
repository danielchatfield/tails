Seems like all the UI's l10n is correctly updated on language change,
but the keyboard layout widget is constantly displayed using the
locale the window was loaded with.

> **Important, but no release blocker**.

* in ubiquity, the `d-i/make-keyboard-names` script uses
  `/usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/xkeyboard-config.mo` to translate
  the keyboard layout names, from list of keyboard layouts gathered
  using the d-i's console-setup `Keyboard/KeyboardNames.pl` script
* `kbd-chooser.c` in `git://git.debian.org/d-i/kbd-chooser.git` uses
  `/usr/share/console/lists/`
