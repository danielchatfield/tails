* French -> get Startpage in French as default search engine
* PortuguÃªs -> get Google as default search engine; expected:
  localized Startpage. Localized search engine is not listed.
  Note that a localized Startpage search engine is shipped in
  `/etc/iceweasel/searchplugins/locale/pt`, but not in `pt-PT`.
* Also check languages that have no localized search engine at all.


> Fixed in `bugfix/default_search_engines`, merged into stable and
> devel.
