i've encountered this issue on my tail 0.12 test install in virtualbox 4.1.12 : after booting from iso and choosing a password during tails greater intermission, i cannot login as root using "sudo su" command, nor start using the truecrypt wich was invoqued at startup : truecrypt program starts, but for validation of decryption, the amnesia user password asked after the truecrypt passphrase, is not recognised...

i've tried with different passwords, including the ones containing only "universaly recognised caracters" (excluding a, z, w, m that change with different layouts of keyboard)

result : password not working !!! and unable to become root ...

i was using the same iso in a different machine with no problem so i don't understand...
