Hi,

For those having difficulty with Tails 0.12 not fully booting to only a Glib Warning halt, this suggestion 
does work for me to complete the bootup, though may not be guaranteed in every case.

When the "Booting Tails" applet first appears, simply
hold down keyboard Ctrl and press the left direction arrow.

Lines of bootup text show and then a pause for a 
Mb progress timer. Allow this time to process
then suddenly the screen will rapidly fill with
many lines of fast moving code.

The desktop will then appear and attempt made 
to synchronize the pc clock with the local 
server, followed by the Iceweazel's Tor 
congratulations box.

Enjoy,
Regards.
