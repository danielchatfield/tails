Hello,

a Tails user just reported it on IRC and I report it here as I had the same thought too for a while.

Possibly it's better to mute the audio or set the volume to zero at boot time because system sounds and accidentially run audio/video files could raise suspicion.

Maybe it's better to let the user do the 2 clicks to enable it, just to be on the safe side.

* see the "Small patch to mute sound on boot time" thread on
  tails-dev; last patch [[attached here|Sound_not_disabled_by_default/0001-Small-patch-to-mute-the-sound-card-Master-channel-on.patch]]
* see Liberte Linux' `liberte/src/usr/local/bin/reset-mixer` (which
  seems to only mute the first sound-card, and supports a limited set
  of controls)
