I am unable to connect to the internet with my physical MAC address, but i have another one which i use which works. I have tried to change it in the network preferences after booting Tails, but that kept creating "Automatic Ethernet connection" without MAC address spoofing specified.

So after i have changed it in the "auto eth0" "Automatic..." has appeared, after i've changed it there and tried to reconnect, it has created a second "Automatic..." and so on.
