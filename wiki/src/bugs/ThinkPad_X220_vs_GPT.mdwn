As [written on thinkwiki](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X220)
and confirmed by a Tails user, the "X220 cannot/will not boot GPT
disks using Legacy BIOS, you must setup UEFI". This is a bug in
their firmware.

In practice, that means a Tails pendrive setup by the Tails
installer cannot boot on a ThinkPad X220, unless we add UEFI support
to Tails.

The same applies to ThinkPad T520 and E325. Other models are listed on
[[support/known_issues]].

The solution is to implement UEFI support: [[!tails_ticket 5739]].

In the meantime, a workaround is to use the [[manual installation
process|doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/linux]]. Note,
however, that this technique does not allow you to set up
a persistent volume.
