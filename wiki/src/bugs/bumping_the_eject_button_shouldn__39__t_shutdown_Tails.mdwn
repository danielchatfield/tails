As of Tails 0.7, it is too easy to shutdown Tails. It shuts down, without waiting for confirmation, if I bump the Eject button on my laptop's CD drive, which is not an uncommon event when moving the laptop across the room. It wouldn't be a big deal if pressing Eject brought up a confirmation dialog box, but immediate unconfirmed shutdown is too much.
