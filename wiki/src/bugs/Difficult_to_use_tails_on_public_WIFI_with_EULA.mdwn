Since Tails prevents any non-tor traffic from going out over the network, it is difficult to use tor on public wireless that requires agreement with an EULA. Tor simply fails to initialize and it's impossible to use the internet.

This is, in my opinion, a significant problem considering the intended audience for Tails (dissidents, etc.).
