Tested using Privacybox.de POP3 connection 

Setting Claws to delete old messages doesn't work. Individually deleting messages also doesn't work on PrivacyBox or TorMail, deletes locally but not on the server.

Tested with Thunderbird and it worked for both PrivacyBox and Tormail. 


> Claws-mail default setting for POP accounts is to delete the messages on the server *7days after the reception*. Did you tried modifying this setting?
