When starting up Tails, several HTTP connections are made to various hosts including:
google.com
riseup.net
torproject.org

These connections are all done in close proximity to each other at startup which gives any performing a timing attack a distinct advantage.

This should be patched to not make ANY connections at startup beyond the expected Tor network connection.

>> See up-to-date plans that will fix this on [[todo/remove_the_htp_user_firewall_exception]].

> Take a look at how the Haven Project does this. It keeps network cards down until explicitly turned on by the user. ["No Network Activity by Default" section](https://www.haven-project.org/overview.html). THP uses  [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) to accomplish this. Even a single ARP from the computer running TAILS will give away the MAC and presence of a live computer. Also see the [[todo/macchanger]] todo.

>> Fixed in devel branch, [[!taglink pending]] for 0.9.
>> See [[todo/remove_the_htp_user_firewall_exception]] for details.
