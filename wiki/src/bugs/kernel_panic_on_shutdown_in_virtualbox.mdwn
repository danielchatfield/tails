On VirtualBox 3.2.12-dfsg-1, Tails from the devel branch
(df35496de89b8f072da19dea88d5685dda354272) does a kernel panic on shutdown,
after kexec on the new kernel to sdmem (see [[bugs/buggy_smem_on_shutdown]])

> Also [[reported in the

>> I cannot reproduce this -- VirtualBox versions 3.2.12 and 4.0.4
>> (both compiled from sources on 64-bit Gentoo) performs the kexec
>> smem wipe without error. The issue must lie somewhere else.
