Tails 0.12 does not boot completely
note: Tails 0.11 does not boot on same computer
1. boot Tails from usb drive
2. select either failsafe mode or normal (added vga=0x314)
**durning other instances of boot attempts, removed all instances of splash, quiet, added xorg-driver=vesa same result occured  

Many lines of information (code, etc.) appear on the screen. Eventually it stops loading the lines. There is a flashing underscore near the bottom of the screen. I can still type, as well as ctrl+alt+del to restart back to the BIOS screen/boot menu.

After waiting awhile more lines appear. Nothing happens after that.

> Should be fixed in 0.12.1, closing.
