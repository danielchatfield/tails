Currently (e.g. in Tails 0.10.1) "http://www.i2p2.de" is captured by
the I2P pattern, which is incorrect. In fact, every domain that has
the string ".i2p" in it is affected. It seems isMultiLine="false" does
*not* make RE into ^RE$ any longer.

Fixed in branch bugfix/foxyproxy_regex.

[[done]] in Tails 0.10.2.
