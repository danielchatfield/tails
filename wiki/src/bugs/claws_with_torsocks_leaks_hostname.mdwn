In Tails 0.12 we introduced `torsocks` as a replacement for `tsocks`
used by the `torify` script. The switch to `torsocks` made Claws Mail,
which is started using `torify`, leak the hostname in the HELO/EHLO
message, resulting in a hostname leak in the `Message ID` and
`Received` email headers. This is currently being worked around by
switching back to `tsocks` for Claws Mail only (in branch
`bugfix/claws_vs_torsocks`) but the fact that `torsocks` behaves worse
than `tsocks` in this respect is worrying and should be investigated
further. Perhaps other applications using `torify` are also affected?
