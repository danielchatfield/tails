In Tails 0.10.1, on AMD Phenom II x6 1100T, ondemand governor is not
automatically enabled. Even if I do enable it manually it works only
partly because of the missing SMP support. The first CPU then goes
into power-saving mode, while all other CPUs don't. With properly
working CPU powersaving in Linux that desktop machine idles at around
55 W, while with Tails it needs more than 120 W when idle (with the
CPU fan running at full speed).
