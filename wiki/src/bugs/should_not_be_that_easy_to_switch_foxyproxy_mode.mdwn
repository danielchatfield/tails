Right-click and middle-click on the foxyproxy settings in Iceweasel's
status bar make it much too easy to switch to a different mode. This
probably was nice at development time, but it's not suitable in
released images. Only the default mode (i.e. automatically decide what
proxy shall be used depending on the URL) should be easily available.

Maybe we could just ask foxyproxy to avoid displaying anything at all
in the status bar?
