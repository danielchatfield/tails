Steps for reproducing error:

1-I downloaded the ISO file.
2-Signature verified successfully.
3-I went to create a "DVD".

> How and where did you went to create a DVD?

ERROR: If I put a blank DVD, either RW or ROM, the message is that NO RECOGNIZES AS DVD 0.

> What software is not recognizing Tails ISO image?

If I put a blank CD, RW or Rom, claims for 753 MB free space, and refuse to burn.

IS THIS AN DVD IMAGE??? OR A CD IMAGE??

> It's an ISO image, that can be burnt onto a DVD using
> appropriate software.

IS FOR A RW OR ROM media????

> There's no difference that I know of on this side.

I fight with this but I cannot solve the problem.
