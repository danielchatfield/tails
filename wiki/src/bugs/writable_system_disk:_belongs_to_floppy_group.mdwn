Tails is affected by [[!debbug 645466]].

In short: the system USB disk and partition block devices (e.g.
`/dev/sdb*`) are writable by the default Live user, because they
belong to the `floppy` group.

> Does it mean you guys didn't even audit user permissions? Oh wow...

This was fixed in Tails 0.12 (see
`config/chroot_local_includes/lib/live/config/998-permissions`) but
the bug has since reappeared so the bug is now reopened. Our `udev`
packages hasn't been updated since, but perhaps the `udev` init script
runs (or re-runs?) after `live-config` wheras it previously only ran
before?

See branch `bugfix/writable_boot_media` for a new fix using `udev`.
