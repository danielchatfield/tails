Tried to get going with a USB boot. 2GB Kingston, if it matters, running on a Dell Vostro netbook. Boot screen runs through "Press enter to activate this console," but not before a line reading "startpar: service(s) returned failure: plymouth ..." with [FAILED] to the right.

Maybe a simple fix, but it's sure got me feeling dumb.
