That large 
"Congratulations you are connected to Tor---" 
notice is such a glaring attention-getter to casual observers in a nosy environment.

Suggest scrapping it and replacing with a momentary
small unobtrusive box in the upper right corner,
showing: 
You are now connected to Tor.

So as to be discrete, this would be perfectly adequate.
Thanks.
