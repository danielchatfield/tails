As [[pointed out in the
forum|/forum/Wiping_Flash_Media:_Problem_in_TAILS_Doc/]], former
versions of our [[documentation on secure
deletion|doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion]], was wrongly
stating that *overwriting twice the available diskspace [on a USB or
solid-state drive] is usually, but not always, sufficient to securely
clean the drive.*

This basically says that in order to securely delete a file from a USB
you could delete the file and then the run "Wipe available diskspace"
even if you have other files on the volume. Which is wrong according to
the paper by [[Wei & al.|http://www.usenix.org/events/fast11/tech/full_papers/Wei.pdf]].

We could propose to wipe the entire device and then reformat it.  But
`srm` doesn't seem to run on block devices: I get "Warning: /dev/sdc is
not a regular file, rename/unlink only!". On the other hand `shred`
seems to work as usual. It is included in Tails but doesn't have a
graphical interface.

So we cannot document a GUI procedure to truly wipe a USB stick at the
moment.

The developers of nautilus-wipe has been contacted and proposed to add a
"Wipe the entire device" option when running on block devices. This
option could start `shred`.
