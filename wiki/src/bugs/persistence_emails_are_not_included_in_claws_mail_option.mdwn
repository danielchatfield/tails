By default, claws mail saves downloaded emails in the ~/Mail folder.

This folder is not included in the persistence when the claws option is
choosen (only .claws-mail which contains the configuration is saved).

Someone reported on IRC that even modifying
`~/.claws-mail/accountrc.tmpl` to set `mailbox=.claws-mail/Mail` doesn't
seems to change anything, this folder isn't created, and the mail aren't saved
in there. Creating this folder by hand hasn't changed the problem for this user.
This should be investigated further though.

Even if claws mail will at some point be replaced by icedove, this should be
fixed. Or the documentation should be updated to explain that the claws mail
option in the persistence setup tool doesn't save emails, and that the users
have to setup a custom persistence folder which would contain ~/Mail.
