Tails 0.8

Tails seems to be resetting the clock to 16 September 2011 12:00am at start up, subsequently causing Vidalia/Tor to fail at boot time. Booting back to the Ubuntu installation on the internal hard drive consistently shows the correct date and time.  

Is it possible that the bug fix (link below) is what is resetting the system time? If so how can I further analyse this issue?

>I just noticed this too. Assuming you're having the same problem I had, keep your network connection unplugged while you boot up, then 

    sudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/50-htp.sh

>and delete the line that says

    mail.riseup.net

>save the file, then plug into your network. 

>There's more to the problem, but that should be an easy workaround. More detail at: [[bugs/__34__Clock_is_approx._6_months_after_the_release_date__34___but_it_was_set_correctly]]
