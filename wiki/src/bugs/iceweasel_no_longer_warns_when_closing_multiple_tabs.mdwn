In Tails 0.7, even though "Edit > Preferences > Tabs > Warn me when
closing multiple tabs" is checked, and in about:config
browser.tabs.warnOnClose is true, Iceweasel does not display any
warning. It just closes down immediately when pressing the Close
Window "X" button provided by GNOME, or Ctrl-Q. This is a problem
since Ctrl-Q is so close to Ctrl-W. All work in the browser is lost,
way too easily. This is a bug since the browser is not performing the
behavior specificed by browser.tabs.warnOnClose.

> Confirmed. Seems like a Debian or upstream bug. Could you please
> report it to Debian and mention the bug number here?
