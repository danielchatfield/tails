In 0.11, when Iceweasel starts, you can see in Vidalia that it opens up connections to all the search providers, Bing, Amazon, Duckduckgo, etc. (also 91.198.174.225, Wikipedia). I don't know why: browser.search.update is set to false.

Still happened in 0.12, still happening in 0.13. Sometimes the Vidalia Network Map doesn't open fast enough to see them all, but I just watched it contact Wikipedia and Google.

The way to reproduce this is to not plug in the ethernet cord until Tails is done booting. Then plug it in, wait for Vidalia's onion to turn green, then open the Network Map as quickly as possible.

There seems to be a workaround. Click on the Iceweasel icon before plugging in the cord. Wait for Iceweasel to start up all the way. Then plug in the cord. Now Iceweasel doesn't seem to try to contact any search providers, apparently having already tried and failed while there was no internet connection.
