Upon "Torbutton detected a Google Captcha. Would you like to be
redirected to another search engine for this query?", after answering
"Redirect", one is redirected to the disappeared Scroogle.

This has already been fixed upstream:
<https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5732>. We need to wait for the
next Torbutton release. Fixed in Tails 0.12.1 which ships Torbutton 1.4.6, so
[[done]].
