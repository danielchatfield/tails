How to reproduce :

1. "Clone & Install" from 0.11

2. Booting should now normally work

3. Create a partition on the free space (ext4 or ext3 were tested)

4. While booting, an error message should now appear: "Missing OS". This message appears before the possibility to select the "failsafe" mode.
