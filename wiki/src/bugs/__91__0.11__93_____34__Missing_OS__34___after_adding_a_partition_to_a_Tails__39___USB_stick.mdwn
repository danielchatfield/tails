How to reproduce :

1. "Clone & Install" from 0.11

2. Booting should now normally work

3. Create a partition on the free space (ext4 or ext3 were tested)

4. While booting, an error message should now appear: "Missing OS". This message appears before the possibility to select the "failsafe" mode.

> This is a bug in udisks, see [[todo/usb_install_and_upgrade/todo]]
> for details. As a workaround, set partition attribute `2` back on
> the Tails system partition.

> Closing as *we* can do much about it, and this is no supported
> usecase anyway.
