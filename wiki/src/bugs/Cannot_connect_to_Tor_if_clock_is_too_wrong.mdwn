HTP connects to HTTPS sites, and fails if it can't verify the certificates.
=> If the system clock is too much wrong, HTP does not fix it and Tor
cannot connect to the network.

Possible kludge that could be setup until Tor is able to tell us the
correct time itself: inside the live system, we can figure out when it
was released. If HTP fails a first time, and if the current time clock
is different by more than 6 (?) months, we start by setting the time
clock to the live system release before attempting HTP once more.
