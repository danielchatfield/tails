Scroogle no longer works. 

I suggest adding startpage.com to the search plugins of Iceweasel as a replace of Scroogle. 

Using 
https://startpage.com/eng/make-startpage-your-homepage.html
and/or
https://startpage.com/do/preferences.pl?language_ui=english

Startpage can be added as as default search. It's also possible to add special language versions. 

Startpage.com is powered by the privacy organisation www.ixquick.com and uses Google search.
