Booting into Tails 0.9 and connection to the Tor network never happens.  Vidalia message is "Loading authority certificates" and it never progresses from there.  Showing the Tor network shows no systems at all.  No problem connecting with the previous Tails version on the same system, network, etc.

> Does it happen consistently, or was it just once?

I'm not the OP but it happens intermittently here too on two separate boxes. Manually opening Vidalia will sometimes show a single connection (like to Sickittotheman) but other times the network map is blank or says no relays available. Rebooting may or may not help.
