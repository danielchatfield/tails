Just upgraded to .10 and the Archive Manager no longer supports .rar files.

This needs to be [[fixed|todo/have_archive_manager_support_rar_again]].

A workaround is to install `unrar`. After setting an administration password
during the boot sequence, open a terminal an issue:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install unrar

But this will not support all RAR archives, unfortunately.
