- [ver 0.4.2] the commands suggested to boot at the F3 page, "live" or
  "livefailsafe", do not work. The boot can only come with
  `amnesia-*country*`. The ones in the F4 page ("memtest" and the one
  to choose boot device) do not work either.
- [0.4.2 / 0.3.X] the boot option suggested in
  `/live/image/md5sum.txt`, "integrity-check", works well - but the
  check always fails. In the 3.X version it seems to be due to
  a difference between the real folder tree, and the one searched by
  the "integrity-check" option :  it seems to look for files that are
  somewhere else.
- [0.4.2 / 0.3.X] the F6 and F7 pages at the help menu suggest wrong
  boot commands, beginning with "install" instead of "live"
  or whatever.
