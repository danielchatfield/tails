Problem with [[todo/erase_memory_on_shutdown]]: when closing Amnesia
and shutting down, my PC shows rows upon rows of SQUASHFS errors, and
it doesn't seem to stop. I tried to ppress CTRL+C but nothing happens.

What should I do, besides radically unplugging the PC? Any advice
would be most welcome.
