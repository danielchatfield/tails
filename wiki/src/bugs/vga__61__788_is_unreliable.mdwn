vga=788 on the boot line crashes one laptop as X starts, in Tails 0.7. In Tails 0.6.2, it caused another laptop to use only part of the screen. Deleting it entirely always fixes the problem.

Can it be removed from the CD?

If not, could you please move it to the very end of the boot parameters, so I don't have to hold down the left arrow key for half a minute to get to the point where I can delete it?

> Right. Removed in Tails 0.7.1 => [[done]].
