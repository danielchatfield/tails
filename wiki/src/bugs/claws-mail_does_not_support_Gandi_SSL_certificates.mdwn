Claws Mail (now using GnuTLS) believes some SSL certificates provided
by Gandi are wrong, although the gnutls-cli utility thinks the
contrary:

    gnutls-cli -V -p 993 \
      --x509cafile /etc/ssl/certs/UTN_USERFirst_Hardware_Root_CA.pem \
      mail.riseup.net

This seems to be a bug in Claws Mail usage of GnuTLS.
