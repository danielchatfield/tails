Claws Mail (now using GnuTLS) believes some SSL certificates provided
by Gandi are wrong:

    Signature status: No certificate issuer found

... although the gnutls-cli utility thinks the contrary:

    gnutls-cli -V -p 993 \
      --x509cafile /etc/ssl/certs/UTN_USERFirst_Hardware_Root_CA.pem \
      mail.riseup.net

This seems to be a bug in Claws Mail usage of GnuTLS.

This probably is
[Claws Mail bug #2199](http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2199).
We should provide more information there, and help us understand this
is no enhancement request but rather a defect.
