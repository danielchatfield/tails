Whenever I use Tails 0.9 in a VM, when I'm typing I get multiple lettres although I'm pressing on one key. So I have to regularly the backspace button. this doesn't always happen. If i press a key on the keyboard very briefly than i'm not getting this problem.

Ik think the keyboard function in Tails is too sensitive.

I use Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit and Windows Virtual PC 2007
