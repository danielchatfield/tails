onBoard starts too early to detect the keyboard layout in use.
Stopping/restarting it makes it work ok.

Starting onboard with a wrapper that sleeps 10s before running it does
not help. Could the environment lack some variable needed to talk to
d-bus or gconf?

This has been reported upstream as
[launchpad bug #391997](https://bugs.launchpad.net/onboard/+bug/391997).

Possible solution: change GNOME session settings so that onBoard is
started after GNOME settings daemon, i.e. at a step >= 50.

> onBoard isn't autostarted anymore, so that [another annoying
> bug](bugs/new_windows_open_in_the_background_when_onboard_is_enabled)
> only affects onBoard users. onBoard users are therefore compelled to
> start it by hand, which fixes the layout detection bug => pending.

>> Actually not: even when run by hand, onBoard does not always
>> detects the keyboard layout.

>>> Fixed with a patched package in this very commit => pending
