onBoard starts too early to detect the keyboard layout in use.
Stopping/restarting it makes it work ok.

Starting onboard with a wrapper that sleeps 10s before running it does
not help. Could the environment lack some variable needed to talk to
d-bus or gconf?

This has been reported upstream as [launchpad bug
#391997](https://bugs.launchpad.net/onboard/+bug/391997).
