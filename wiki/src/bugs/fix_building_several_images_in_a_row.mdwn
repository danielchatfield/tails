Fixing the apt/preferences lh
[bug](http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2009/06/msg00181.html) will
re-allow building several images types in a row.

This bug is supposed to have been fixed in commit 22d95e7a32c78bd0f72
to `live-helper`. We should now:

- remove `config/chroot_local-includes/etc/apt/preferences`: *done*
- test it builds nicely: *done*
- check that the image has the correct packages versions: *done*
- check that the image has the correct `/etc/apt/preferences` and
  `/etc/apt/apt.conf`: *done*
- bump the required `live-helper` version in [[contribute/build]] and
  `debian/control`: *done*
- check we can build several images types in a row: **still broken**
- close this bug

[[Closing|bugs/done]] as invalid, as we don't need to build several
images types anymore, thanks to isohybrid'ing the built ISO's.
