The 7 April 2011 iso image is accompanied by a text file giving a "hash" as an integrity check.  To prevent malicious tampering, this text file is signed with a key with fingerprint
 
0D24 B36A A9A2 A651 7878  7645 1202 821C BE2C D9C1

which can be found by searching keyservers for amnesia@boum.org.  Unfortunately, checking the signature gives:

gpg: Signature made Wed 06 Apr 2011 .... using RSA key ID BE2CD9C1
gpg: BAD signature from "T(A)ILS developers (signing key) <amnesia@boum.org>"

> The detached GnuPG signature (`.asc`) is the **ISO** file's
> signature, not the one for the hash file (`.sha256`). The signature
> can be directly used to check the ISO file's integrity, no need to
> insert an extra step.
