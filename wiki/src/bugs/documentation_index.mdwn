On the [documentation index](https://tails.boum.org/doc/index.fr.html), some links are pointing to the english version even from the french, spanish or german documentation index page.

The firsts links (Get Tails) are ok, but the other one not.

The bullets are also uncorrectly showing in the first part (General information)
