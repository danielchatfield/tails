All attempts at creating a liveUSB with tails USBinstaller fail.
Original liveUSB created manually, with Unetbootin, and disk creator in Kubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit.
Original liveUSB will boot fine, but any copy made using USB installer will give Opearting System Not Found at boot.
HD of system is using GUID.
Abilitiy to create a liveusb is not the problem, but being unable to use usb installer prevents creation of persistent bootable volume.
