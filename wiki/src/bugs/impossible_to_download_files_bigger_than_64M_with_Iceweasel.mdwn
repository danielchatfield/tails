In Tails 0.7.x it is impossible to download files bigger than 64MB
using Iceweasel.

This is the same bug as [[!tor_bug 1149]].

The download stalls at 64MB. If I disable Polipo's chunkHighMark, the
download stalls at this setting's default value (24M).

The really annoying thing about this bug is that it prevents
downloading Tails images from Tails itself :/

> Working to [[todo/stop_using_polipo_in_iceweasel]], which will fix this bug.

>> [[done]] in Tails 0.10
