I couldn't say exactly wich update marked the swich but i can't make an (not so) old fujitsu/siemensamilo Pi 2530 laptop boot on tailsusb. The usb tails is ok, the key is detected in the bios boot shit etc., but the computer starts everytime on hd, i don'see tails menu at all. Earlier usbtails used to work on this computer for the cd player is dead (so i can't try livecd).
I think the latest working version was somewhere in early march (sorry i can't say better). Other liveusb distr like latest backtrack are working on the same computer.
