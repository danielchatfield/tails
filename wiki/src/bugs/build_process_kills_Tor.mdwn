Building a Tails image kills my build system's Tor process (twice, I
think, but I'd need to check). This has been happening in the last few
weeks/months. Here we see the limits of building inside a plain old
chroot... maybe we shall contribute LXC support into live-build at
some point.

Tor is killed just after the big apt-get install command starts
preconfiguring packages:

	Get:872 http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ squeeze/non-free zd1211-firmware all 2.21.0.0-1 [16.5 kB]
	Extracting templates from packages: 100%
	Preconfiguring packages ...
	Stopping tor daemon: tor.
	Fetched 805 MB in 15s (51.8 MB/s)

The `vidalia.config` package script seems guilty: if the
`vidalia/tor-daemon-interaction` debconf setting is set to `nothing`
or `one-off`, it runs `pkill -x tor`. We have it set to `nothing` via
preseeding. This seems like a bug in this script: at first glance, Tor
should be stopped by it if `vidalia/tor-daemon-interaction` is set top
`one-off` or `permanent`, and *not* if set to `nothing`.

This was reported as [[!debbug 623203]].
