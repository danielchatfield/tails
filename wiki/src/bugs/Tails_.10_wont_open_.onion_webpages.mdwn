When I attempt to load a .onion webpage, TAILS fails to open the page, even though I can open the page using TOR in Windows. The message that is given is a Timeout due to length of time connecting. 

A possible reason may be that my clock was synced, but it is reading 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of the actual time. 

> Tails uses UTC timezone. Was the clock correctly sync'd to UTC?
> Were you notified (top-right corner of the screen) it was?

Note I can load non-.onion webpages without issue. 

Also I am on a wireless router.

Here is the actual error message:

	[Notice] Tried for 120 seconds to get a connection to [scrubbed]:80. Giving up. (waiting for circuit)

> This generally happens when one tries to connect to a .onion service
> *before* the clock sync' is finished. May you please retry and take

>> No reply from OP, should be fixed in 0.10.1, closing.
