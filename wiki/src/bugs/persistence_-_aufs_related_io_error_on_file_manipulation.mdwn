When activating the APT related persistence presets in read only mode
the parent folder (and sub-folders) of where the directories are
mounted get hit by some aufs bug (or limitation). For instance, the
preset making `/var/lib/apt/lists` persistent produces the following
error when trying to create/modify/delete a file in `/var/lib/apt` and
`/var/lib/apt/mirrors` etc.:

    touch: setting times of `/var/lib/apt/test': Input/output error

and in dmesg:

    aufs au_lkup_neg:326:touch[4924]: I/O Error, apt should be negative on b0.

The error does not occur when dealing with the mounted directory like
`/var/lib/apt/lists`. Unmounting the preset doesn't fix it, but since
the underlying fs (/) is also aufs, perhaps the outer aufs is corrupted
for some reason?

Interestingly (and obiously) other presets are not affected, so a fine
question is what makes the APT presets different. Here's a list:

* They're owned by root:root
* ???
