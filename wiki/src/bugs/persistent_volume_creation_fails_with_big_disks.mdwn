USB Flash Kingston DataTraveller 32GB

When trying to create persistens volume.
It starts and after some time (about a minute) error comes.

    Persistence wizard - Persistence volume creation
    
    Failed
    
    org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. Possible
    causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message
    bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the
    network connection was broken

After that flash becomes unbootable.

On a 2GB flash drive it's ok. Works fine. Tried different USB ports, stays the
same.

>>> Confirmed. Bumping the timeout to 10 minutes fixes this bug for
