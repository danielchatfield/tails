Since Tails 0.11, the default search engine in iceweasel is Google.

It should be Startpage SSL (in the GUI language, as in the 0.10.2?) In this case, please add StartPage SSL in english in the search engine list.

> Fixed in `bugfix/update-iceweasel-searchplugins-location` branch,
> merged into stable and devel branches.
