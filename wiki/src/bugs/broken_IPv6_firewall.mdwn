It has been reported that the IPv6 firewall was not active on T(A)ILS 0.5.

    sudo ip6tables -L -n
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         

    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination   

> T(A)ILS has no service listening on the network, and Tor is not able
> to resolve hostnames to IPv6 yet, so AFAIK the only problem caused
> by this bug is the possibility to directly connect (= *without*
> going through the Tor network) to a manually entered IPv6 address.
> The problem probably only arises when using an application that is
> not configured to use Polipo/Tor as a proxy; this means an
> application that is neither Iceweasel nor a GNOME application nor a
> software respecting `http_proxy` or `HTTP_PROXY`.
>
> The risk seems so tiny to me I think it does not deserve a security
> announce. The bug still needs to be fixed though!

> Fixed by this very commit => [[done]].
