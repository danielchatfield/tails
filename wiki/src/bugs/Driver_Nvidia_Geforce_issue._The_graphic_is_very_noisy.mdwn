I use Ubuntu 12.04 on a HP Pavilion Slimline machine with Nvidia Geforce graphic card.

The computer was very noisy with Ubuntu because of the graphic card and I had to install the Nvidia proprietary drivers available through the Ubuntu interface.

When I run Tails, the computer is noisy also. So I would like to use Nvidia proprietary drivers, or a free driver that works properly with machine.

Is it possible ? If yes, how can I do ? Or is there another way the manage this issue (the noise of the graphic card) ? For instance with persistence.

I really need Tails, but I can't work with because of this noise. I'm afraid that the card processor burns also..

This issue is known and I've read on forums that the only solution known is to use the proprietary drivers.

Please, let me know.

Regards.
