  [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
* The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System was inspired by the [Incognito
  LiveCD](http://anonymityanywhere.com/incognito/). The Incognito
  author [has declared it to be

  2010, and written that The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System "should
  be considered as its spiritual successor".

  early source of inspiration, too.
