<h1>This forum is closed</h1>

<p>Given the amount of daily work Tails requires, we are unfortunately
not able to properly take care of this forum at the same time as we
are preparing the [[!tails_todo improve_the_forum desc="migration to a Questions & Answers web
site"]] that will be better suited for user
support.</p>

<p>So, we have decided to close down the forum in its current form, and
instead focus on getting something better ready as soon as possible.</p>

<p>There are still a few [[support options|support]] left... and [[many
ways to contribute|contribute]] :)</p>
