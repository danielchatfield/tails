* Mike Hommey's
  [Debian EFI mode boot on a Macbook Pro, without
  rEFIt](http://glandium.org/blog/?p=2830).
* Matthew Garrett detailed [the ISO images for Fedora 17 installation
  CD](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/11285.html) and [their Mac
  support](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12037.html): it supports BIOS,
  UEFI, Mac platforms when burned to a CD or written directly to a USB
  stick. This might be nice for the ISO that Tails distribute, but not
  applicable to support USB sticks with incremental updates.
