# Roadmap

1. (**past**) Tails 0.13 has the harmless part of the
   `feature/incremental-upgrades` branch merged (users creation with
   sudo credentials, dependencies installation), leaving aside the
   part about running the upgrade frontend automatically at startup.
   => Tails 0.13 should have been able to incrementally upgrade to
   something newer, when running the upgrade frontend by hand,
   but the included Tails OpenPGP signing key expired too quickly for
   this to happen.

2. (**past**) Now that 0.14 is out:

   * Prepare IUK: **done**
   * Update upgrade-description files: **done**
   * Ask beta testers to try the incremental upgrade process: **done**
   * Find most critical bugs: **done**.

3. Complete **phase one: make ready for more alpha testing**

   Now that all child tickets of [[!tails_ticket 5922 desc="phase
   one"]] were resolved:

   * Prepare IUK
   * Update upgrade-description files
   * Ask alpha testers to try the incremental upgrade process
   * Catch and fix most remaining bugs

4. Complete **phase two: make ready for beta testing**

   Resolve all child tickets of [[!tails_ticket 5490 desc="phase
   two"]], and then:

   * Prepare IUK
   * Update upgrade-description files
   * Ask beta testers to try the incremental upgrade process
   * Catch and fix most remaining bugs
   * Review user documentation and translations

5. Complete **phase three: deploy in production**

   Once we're happy with the whole thing, ship it, enabled by
   default, in the next Tails major release.

   See child tickets of [[!tails_ticket 6014 desc="phase three"]].

6. Later

   See tickets with *Incremental upgrades* category on [[!tails_redmine]].

# Code

* The bulk of the code needed to implement this design lives in the
  `iuk` [[contribute/Git]] repository.
* Integration work is being done in the `feature/incremental-upgrades`
  branch of the main Tails [[contribute/Git]] repository.

# Random ideas for future improvements

These are not worth creating tickets yet, as it's not even clear these
changes are useful enough to put time in it.

### Packaging could be more self-contained

Move `/etc/sudoers.d/zzz_upgrade` and IUK-related user creation from
the Tails main Git repository to the `tails-iuk` Debian package, so
that it's more self-contained and easier to test.

### Button for aborting upgrade cleanly

### Compute and display ETA

### Multi-step incremental upgrade

E.g. 0.11 boots after 0.11.1 and 0.11.2 are out. Tails fetches
https://tails.boum.org/upgrade/v1/Tails/0.11/i386/stable/upgrades.yml,
that shall contain an incremental upgrade path with two target files:
the 0.11 to 0.11.1 IUK, and the 0.11.1 to 0.11.2 IUK. The upgrader
would download these two files and install the two IUKs in the
correct order.

### sharing upgrade material

Once the incremental upgrade has been applied, I may be proposed to
save a copy of the target files to a location of my choosing.

### allow one to download target files in the clear

The downloader program could provide an opt-in way to have the
download happen in the clear, that is without going through the Tor
network. It looks doable given it's a separate process: we may run it
as a dedicated user, and reuse the `clearnet` infrastructure
implemented for the Unsafe Browser.

### "Retry with new circuit" button

Circuit throughput varies wildly, and since this is a large download,
it'll quickly wear out users' patience if a bad circuit is picked.
Or maybe this can happen behind the scenes, e.g.:  Automatically
switch circuit every X minutes or Y% progress? That could even make
fingerprinting the download on the Tor client <-> Entry Node side of
the pipe a bit more difficult, for whatever that's worth.
