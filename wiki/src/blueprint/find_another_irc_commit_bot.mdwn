[CIA.vc is
dead](http://shadowm.rewound.net/blog/archives/245-CIA.vc-is-dead.html). It
would be good to find another way to have commits announced to the IRC
channels.

`repo.or.cz` which was used to send updates to CIA is also able to trigger
HTTP post compatible with HTTP post compatible with [GitHub
webhooks](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks).
[gitbot](https://github.com/thedjinn/gitbot) is a fairly trivial bot
written in Ruby that receives these kind of commit notifications and
write them on an IRC channel. However, repo.or.cz does not support
notifications for mirror projects. It does not look that hard to add
this feature to their software, but we were not able to get an
up-to-date copy thereof after 2 emails and 5 weeks, so this does not
look viable a solution.

Other options: [irker](http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/) and
[KGB](http://kgb.alioth.debian.org/). Both needs to be able to set custom
post-receive hooks in the repository. That's why we have
[[!tails_ticket 5480 desc="centralized Git repositories"]].

Next steps
==========

## immerda

See [[!tails_ticket 6033]] and sub-tasks.

## plan B

If it does not work as planned at immerda, we could research for
a third-party to offer either the "IRC notification reacting on GitHub
webhooks" service or the full "monitor Git repositories and notify on
IRC" one.

Or we could host the whole set of our own Git repositories ourselves,
so that we can use KGB or irker.
