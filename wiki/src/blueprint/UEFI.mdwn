For Tails 2.0 we want at least basic UEFI boot including Mac.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Goals and non-goals
===================

Goals
-----

* devices produced by Tails Installer should boot on most UEFI-only
  hardware (e.g. some relevant set of Macs)
* devices produced by Tails Installer should boot on most hardware
  that only supports UEFI boot for GPT devices (e.g. ThinkPad X220)

Non-goals
---------

* UEFI DVD boot: BIOS boot from DVD works fine on most hardware,
  including Macs; adding the files needed to have UEFI DVD boot work
  on some systems will break what currently works for others.
* UEFI boot from hybrid ISO cat'd on a USB device: given BIOS DVD boot
  works generally fine, it's OK to require users to go this way and
  install their UEFI-capable Tails USB stick from DVD.
* Secure Boot support is not part of this plan. Picking technical
  solutions that leave room for Secure Boot would be a great
  bonus, though.

Resources
=========

* lernstick Grub configuration, implemented as a live-build binary
  hook, that's meant to be nice with an existing syslinux
  configuration managed by live-build:
  <https://github.com/imedias/lernstickAdvanced.git> (oh, and they use
  the [xmlboot](https://github.com/imedias/xmlboot) gfxboot script and
  many crazy Grub configuration scripts)
* [hellais' TAILS-OSX scripts](https://github.com/hellais/TAILS-OSX)
  and the [list of
  hardware](https://github.com/hellais/TAILS-OSX/blob/master/tested-on.md)
  it was tested on
* [Mac Linux USB Loader](http://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/)
  Doesn't work with Tails at the moment, but that's a frequent request
  to upstream. Upstream is working on fixing this. That would allow
  starting Tails on Mac UEFI.
* Steve McIntyre's EFI installation progress:
  - [[!debpkg debian-cd]] 3.1.11 has x86 EFI support, see the
    `debian/changelog` for details
  - [fourth](http://blog.einval.com/2012/09/03#Debian_EFI_4) (2012-09-03)
  - [third](http://blog.einval.com/2012/08/24#Debian_EFI_3)
  - [second](http://blog.einval.com/2012/08/22#Debian_EFI_2) (2012-08-22)

* rEFIt developer, Rod Smith, may be willing to help:
  [[forum/Boot_fails_from_usb_thumb_drive_on_Macbook_Pro]]
* ArchLinux' page about
  [UEFI Bootloaders](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/UEFI_Bootloaders)
* syslinux 6 (released in June 2013) has UEFI support. Debian Live's
  UEFI support will be based on it.
  - Early users [discussion and
    hints](http://www.marshut.com/kyxhm/question-about-syslinux-efi-alpha-version.html).
  - It seems that syslinux does not do very well with CD booting and
    UEFI: a FAT32 ElTorito image (with kernel, initrd and boot loader
    configuration) must be embedded into the ISO9660. syslinux can't
    read any other file system than the one it was booted from, so we
    have to duplicate these files. Also, this image must be smaller
    than 32MB. Indeed,
    [Knoppix](http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html) 7.2 uses
    syslinux 6, and supports "UEFI-Boot (DVD: 32 and 64bit, CD: only
    32bit) *after installation on USB flash disk*".
* Kanotix, based on Debian Live and GRUB2, has a isohybrid setup that
  allows "multi-hybrid booting" as CD-ROM (EFI or El Torito) or as
  a hard-drive (e.g. a USB pendrive) on Intel-Macs (EFI) and PCs (EFI
  or MBR). [See
  details](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002587.html).
* Debian's Linux 3.2 kernel has "UEFI stub" support, which
  allows it to be started directly since the EFI boot menu.
* Running a UEFI firmware for virtual machines (after installing the
  `ovmf` package): `qemu-system-x86_64 -bios /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd`
* [Booting a Self-signed Linux
  Kernel](http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2013/09/02/booting-a-self-signed-linux-kernel/),
  by Greg Kroah-Hartman
* [Ubuntu Privacy Remix](https://www.privacy-cd.org/)'s next release
  (UPR 12.04r1) will support UEFI; a beta is available; they copied
  the solution from Ubuntu 13.10 (beta): the shim bootloader and
  a corresponding GRUB binary which passes secure boot. See their
  [build script](https://www.privacy-cd.org/en/tutorials/build-your-own-cd/79).
* [Managing EFI Boot Loaders for Linux by Rod Smith](http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/index.html)
* Debian's Secure Boot support will be done for GRUB first, unclear if
  other bootloaders will be supported
* shim is not in Debian yet (2013-11-28)

There is then two big area that needs work to support EFI:

 * ISO images need to support EFI, both for DVD and when [[dumped on USB
   sticks|contribute/design/hybrid_ISO]]. A work similar to the one done by
   Matthew Garrett on Fedora 17 should probably be done upstream
   in [live-build](http://live.debian.net/).
 * The [[USB installer|contribute/design/installation]] needs to
   setup the partition table and system partition in a way that can boot
   on both BIOS and UEFI systems. Proper Mac support would be a nice bonus.

EFI boot on Mac without rEFInd
------------------------------

This is not a requirement of ours for the first iteration, but could
be a nice future improvement.

* Mike Hommey's
  [Debian EFI mode boot on a Macbook Pro, without
  rEFIt](http://glandium.org/blog/?p=2830).
* Matthew Garrett detailed [the ISO images for Fedora 17 installation
  CD](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/11285.html) and [their Mac
  support](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12037.html): it supports BIOS,
  UEFI, Mac platforms when burned to a CD or written directly to a USB
  stick. This might be nice for the ISO that Tails distribute, but not
  applicable to support USB sticks with incremental updates.
