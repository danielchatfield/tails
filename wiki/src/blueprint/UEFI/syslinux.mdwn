Prerequisite: Tails with an amd64 kernel (e.g. from current
experimental branch).

Tested with syslinux 6.02+dfsg-1.

	sudo apt-get install syslinux/experimental \
	   syslinux-common/experimental isolinux/experimental

	# make the system partition an *EFI System Partition* (ESP)
	parted "$TAILS_DEVICE" set 1 boot on

	mkdir -p "$TAILS_MOUNTPOINT"/EFI/BOOT && \
	   cp /usr/lib/SYSLINUX/efi64/syslinux.efi \
	      "$TAILS_MOUNTPOINT"/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi && \
	   cp "$TAILS_MOUNTPOINT"/syslinux/* "$TAILS_MOUNTPOINT"/EFI/BOOT/ && \
	   /bin/cp -f /usr/lib/syslinux/modules/efi64/* "$TAILS_MOUNTPOINT"/EFI/BOOT/

* boots on ThinkPad X220 (syslinux 6.02+dfsg-1 and
  3:6.03~pre1+dfsg-1~bpo60+1) in UEFI mode
* ThinkPad X230 (syslinux 3:6.03~pre1+dfsg-1~bpo60+1):
  - boots fine in UEFI mode, but displays the syslinux menu very much
    translated to the top: one can see the two menu entries, but
    nothing else, so if one must edit the kernel command-line, they
    have to do it blindly
  - boots fine in Legacy BIOS mode, so at least we have no hardware
    support regression here
* boots on ThinkPenguin Royal (syslinux 6.02+dfsg-1 and 6.03~pre1+dfsg-1)
* does not boot on MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2012 without rEFInd (expected)
* boots on MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2012 (EFI 2.9) with rEFInd *if* `menu
  background splash.png` is removed from `stdmenu.cfg`; adding `menu
  resolution 640 480` before `menu background` makes the menu display
  "correctly" (only taking 1/4 of the screen, but oh well), *but* the
  system does not boot
* boots on MacBook Pro 13-inch Late 2011 (EFI 2.7) with rEFInd *if* `menu
  background splash.png` is removed from `stdmenu.cfg`
* on MacBook Pro 13-inch Mid 2012 with rEFInd, one has to choose
  *Fallback boot loader from Tails* in rEFInd to boot, as the *Boot
  Linux from Tails* entry does nothing at all (syslinux 6.02+dfsg-1
  and 6.03~pre1+dfsg-1)
* The ThinkPenguin Royal does not detect the bootloader if installed
  as `EFI/Tails/syslinux.efi`; hence the use of the fallback bootloader
  path (`BOOT/bootx64.efi`), which should work on more hardware.
* tails-i386-feature_uefi-0.23-20131222T0855Z-8acf864.iso
  boots fine on a Apple MacBook Air 13" mid 2011 (MacBookAir4,2)
  once installed with Tails Installer
