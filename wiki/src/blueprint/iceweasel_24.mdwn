What needs to be checked
========================

Prefs in a weird state
----------------------

We already have a list of prefs that are in a weird state
([[!tails_ticket 5768]]). It can be useful to check what follows, and
perhaps the move to FF24 would be a great time to clean them up,
update the list, and if possible finally empty it and be done with
that task.

Differing user-set prefs
------------------------

* `browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID`
* `browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone`

New(ly) user-set prefs
----------------------

* `dom.mozApps.used`
* `extensions.ui.*`
* `pdfjs.*`
* `plugin.disable_full_page_plugin_for_types`

Torbrowser prefs bundled into omni.ja
-------------------------------------

The `0022-Tor-Browser-s-Firefox-preference-overrides.patch` Torbrowser
patch bundles their prefs directly into `omni.ja`.

Most of them are probably just what we want, so we could just drop
them from our own `/etc/iceweasel/{pref/iceweasel.js,profile/user.js`:
this would be a nice first step for [[!tails_ticket 5706]].

Some others default Torbrowser prefs may not be what we want, and then
we have to check that they are correctly overriden by our own prefs.

What works
==========

Basic fingerprinting
--------------------

A build from `feature/ff24` is seen by ip-check.info just the same way
is Tails 0.20.1's browser.
