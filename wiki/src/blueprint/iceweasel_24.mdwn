Current status
==============

The `feature/ff24` branch builds, boots and basically works fine.

Needs to be checked
===================

Basic fingerprinting
--------------------

Comparing to TBB 3.0b1:

* ip-check.info says TBB 3.0b1 has JavaScript version 1.8, while the
  Tails browser 24.1 has version 1.5
  - It says 1.8 too for Tails 0.21 and TBB 2.3.25-14-dev, so that
    looks like a regression.
  - It says 1.5 too for iceweasel 24.1.0esr-1 on Debian sid, so
    perhaps we should investigate the changes in the Iceweasel
    patchset between 17 and 24.1.
  - No downgraded package in that ISO vs. 0.21.
  - Perhaps some build-dep picked by the weird pbuilder chroot we had
    to setup to build our 24.1 browser is at fault.
* panopticlick: same results, modulo screen size

Known working
=============

Basic fingerprinting
--------------------

A build from `feature/ff24` is seen by ip-check.info just the same way
is Tails 0.20.1's browser.

Prefs

... were cleaned up (#5768), many were merged with Torbrowser's ones,
and they are in the intended state at runtime.
