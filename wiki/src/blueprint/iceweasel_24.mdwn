**Ticket**: [[!tails_ticket 6370 desc="#6370"]]

Current status
==============

The `feature/ff24` branch builds, boots and basically works fine.

Guidelines for testers
======================

1. Test an ISO built from the `feature/ff24` branch. The most recent
   [nightly built](http://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_feature-wheezy/)
   one should do.

1. Always report the exact *commit* the ISO you are testing was built
   from (if it is a nightly built one, report its filename; if you
   built it yourself, see *About Tails*).

1. If you discover something suboptimal, first please check *Known
   issues* below, sub-tasks of [[!tails_ticket 6370]]. Then, please
   check if it's a regression compared to the current stable Tails
   * If it is a regression, file a sub-task of [[!tails_ticket 6370]].
   * If it is not a regression, report a complete bug
     with WhisperBack.
   Note that the main goal of this testing session is *to discover
   regressions* in `feature/ff24`, and get confidence in it;
   basically, everything else will be treated as low-priority.
   Let's keep focus :)

1. If in doubt, ask on IRC (`#tails-dev`).

Needs to be checked
===================

Unsafe Browser
--------------

Especially close and start again.

Persistent bookmarks feature
----------------------------

* bootstrapped on this branch
* created with an older Tails, upgrading

Known issues
============

Basic fingerprinting
--------------------

Comparing to TBB 3.0b1:

* ip-check.info says TBB 3.0b1 has JavaScript version 1.8, while the
  Tails browser 24.1 has version 1.5
  - It says 1.8 too for Tails 0.21 and TBB 2.3.25-14-dev, so that
    looks like a regression.
  - It says 1.5 too for iceweasel 24.1.0esr-1 on Debian sid, so
    perhaps we should investigate the changes in the Iceweasel
    patchset between 17 and 24.1.
  - No downgraded package in that ISO vs. 0.21.
  - Perhaps some build-dep picked by the weird pbuilder chroot we had
    to setup to build our 24.1 browser is at fault.

Known working
=============

Basic fingerprinting
--------------------

A build from `feature/ff24` is seen by ip-check.info just the same way
is Tails 0.20.1's browser.

Comparing to TBB 3.0b1:

* panopticlick: same results, modulo screen size

Prefs
-----

... were cleaned up (#5768), many were merged with Torbrowser's ones,
and they are in the intended state at runtime.
