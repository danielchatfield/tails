# Things to look for

We should investigate the flexibility of how you can define the goals,
e.g. can you only have one, or can you have many? For the former we
probably would have to setup a separate campaign for each deliverable
(which may introduce more overhead), and but for the latter we could
just make each deliverable a sub-goal of the general "Fund Tails
development" campaign.

We should also investigate the financial overhead (e.g. fees) of these
options.

Here's a useful report about crowfunding:

The interesting bit is this table comparing different sites (page 8).

## Bountysource

Website: <https://www.bountysource.com/>

After a quick glance this looks very promising, as its model is a bit
more aligned to something suitable for open source projects compated
to general crowdsourcing sites. As far as I understand, Bountysource
has something like the following concepts:

* Fund raiser, same as in other crowdsourcing sites (time-limited, has
  a set funding goal (in terms of money)).

* Bounty, unlike fund raisers these don't have a time-limit or funding
  goal (in terms of money). They can even be left open, meaning that
  other community members can assign themselves to the bounty,
  implement it, show it to the parent project and then reap the
  bounty, suitable for wish-list tasks.

* Parent project, which can own several bounties. The interesting part
  with this is that I think it may encourage continuous contribution
  from backers.

I'm not sure, though, what would be most suitable model for funding
development for us. Fund raisers are good since they have a time-limit
and funding goal, which I think encourage backing sooner rather than
later since they're not as open-ended as a bounty. OTOH, if we'd use a
bounty, we could specify such things in the description. One bad thing
with fund raisers is that they cannot be owned by a parent project
(like in other sites, they seem to be thought of more as a way to fund
the creation of a completely new project, not add stuff to an existing
one).
