The [[design document dedicated to virtualization
support|contribute/design/virtualization_support]] contains notes
about the already working bits in this field.

## Tails as a VirtualBox guest

The VirtualBox 4.x guest utilities, X11 drivers and kernel modules are
installed inside Tails.

What works:

* the option to integrate the guest windows inside a X11 desktop
* kernel modules are loaded at runtime
* X11 auto-detects the VirtualBox video and input drivers
* sharing folders between a GNU/Linux host and a Tails guest
* mouse integration

Since we want to support the "Tails as a guest inside Windows"
usecase, we need to test:

* desktop integration inside Windows
 - Win7 SP1, VirtualBox 4.0.4 r70112: mouse integration works
   flawlessly
* filesharing between a Tails guest and a Windows host

> No bug report about it for a while, let's close this task.

## Tails as a VMware guest

Seems to work fine inside VMWare Player 3, using the ISO as the
guest's CD-ROM, with the 'Debian 5' Guest OS preset.

Warn users when running inside a VM
===================================

Most of the work [[has been done|contribute/design/virtualization_support]].

Left to do:

* [[todo/warn_users_when_running_in_a_non-free_VM]]
* when running inside a VM within a non-free host OS, emphasize the
  pseudo-security situation; seems almost impossible, let's forget
  about it

Autorun Tails in Windows
========================

See [[todo/autorun_in_Windows]].
