[[!meta title="Easy tasks for new contributors"]]

The tasks marked as "easy" in our bug tracker have been determined to be great
starting points for new contributors. The description of the tasks should
provide useful pointers as well as at least one expert who will be available to
help you if you have questions.

These tasks include all kinds of work: testing, design, writing, coding, etc.

XXX It would be good to have a reference person for each one of these tasks. How to do that with Redmine?

[Easy tasks ordered by XXX](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=112)

You can also have a look at the tasks marked as [low priority](XXX) in our bug
tracker. We marked them as of low priority according to our
[roadmap]((https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap) but they might
be very interesting, useful and fun to work on!

Recommendations
===============

  - Once you choose a task that fits your skills... XXX shall we tell them to
    assign the task to themselves on Redmine or to send a mail to tails-dev?

  - Keep XXXthe bug tracker or tails-devXXX updated with your progress each week
    or so.

  - If you realize that you cannot complete a task reset the assignee to
    default.

  - Even if you are deeply skilled, please consider doing one little easy hack,
    to get used to the process. After that, you are invited to move on up to the
    more difficult tasks, leaving some of the easy tasks to others so they can
    get involved and achieve change themselves.
