[[!meta title="Easy tasks for new contributors"]]

The tasks marked as "easy" in our bug tracker have been determined to be good
starting points for new contributors. The description of the tasks should
provide useful pointers as well as at least one expert who will be available to
help you if you have questions.

These tasks include all kinds of work: testing, design, writing, coding, etc.

You can also have a look at other tasks marked as [low
priority](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=131) in
our bug tracker. We marked them as of low priority according to our
[roadmap]((https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap) but they might
be interesting, useful and fun to work on!

Recommendations
===============

  - Once you choose a task that fits your skills assign the task to yourself on
    Redmine and send a mail to [[tails-dev@boum.org|contribute/talk]].

  - Keep the bug tracker or [[tails-dev@boum.org|contribute/talk]] updated with
    your progress each week or so.

  - If you realize that you cannot complete a task, reset the assignee to
    default in Redmine.

  - Even if you are deeply skilled, please consider doing one little easy hack,
    to get used to the process. After that, you are invited to move on up to the
    more difficult tasks, leaving some of the easy tasks to others so they can
    get involved and achieve change themselves.
