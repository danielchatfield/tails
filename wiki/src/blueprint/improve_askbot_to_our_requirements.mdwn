Let's wait until we
[[todo/decide_what_kind_of_web_support_do_we_want_to_provide]] first.

If we decide to improve Askbot to our requirements here is some food for
thought.

  - <http://askbot.org/>
  - Django webapp, forked from OSQA.
  - <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel>
  - Most of the development is [done by 2
    people](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/graphs/contributors),
    they are also selling it as a service.
  - The commit count looks promising: 393 (2009), 594 (2010), 1249
    (2011), 1106 (2012)

### Debian packaging

  - [[!debbug 687966 desc="RFP #687966"]]
  - Has [many dependencies](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/blob/master/askbot_requirements.txt) outside of Debian:
    - akismet
    - coffin
    - django-keyedcache
    - django-robots
    - django-kombu
    - django-followit

### Features

  - Anonymous posting: filling up the email field is
    required but the validity of the email is not checked.
  - Email notifications:
    - *Asked by me*
    - *Answered by me*
    - *Individually selected*
    - *Entire forum (tag filtered)*
    - *Comments and posts mentioning me*
  - List matching questions on the fly when typing a new question.
  - The software is
    [translated](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/askbot/) but there
    is no multilingual support from the web interface.
  - No subsite feature.

### Wishlist

  * Add multilanguage feature to:
    - allow users to change the language of the interface they see
    - allow to filter the content by the language of the questions
  * Add a subsite feature:
    - a single login should allow to post on different subsites
    - a single user might have different credentials, karmas and badges
      in different subsites
    - allow to move questions between subsites (if allowed to do so)
    - subsites can be tied to one or more languages (see multilanguage)
