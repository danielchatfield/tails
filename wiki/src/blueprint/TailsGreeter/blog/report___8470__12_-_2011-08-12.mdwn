## Problems:

Generation of layout list based on language or locale is incomplete - it works only
for some well-tested cases (e. g. Русский). More testing required for other languages
and general code refactoring needed as well.

## Near-future plans:

0. Finish layout generation code.
0. Update documentation.
0. Other plans from timeline.

## Additional notes:

Please test how it works for YOUR favorite language.
The GSoC is almost over - next week is the time for final wrap-ups.
