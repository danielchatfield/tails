## Current progress

0. document interface to locale-gen - DONE.
0. make sure it's possible to choose language multiple times before 'forward' button pressed - DONE.
0. apply chosen language to gnome session - needs testing
0. borrow ubiquity widgets for keyboard layout if possible - DONE.
0. create keyboard layout widget - in progress.
0. update requestor widget to hide password while typing - DONE.
0. [Convert packages to dh_python2](http://wiki.debian.org/Python/TransitionToDHPython2) because python-support is deprecated -  merge dh_python2 branch - DONE.
0. pressing 'enter' in password request widget should be equal to button click - DONE.
0. version tag and update - DONE.

## Problems

0. What's the best way to check that chosen language was actually applied to gnome session in Debian? 1) dpkg-reconfigure locales 2) choose supported locale 3) ??? are there some packages got to be installed? some env vars set? what should change as a result of proper language choice?
In short - test-case description is missing.
0. Layout widget borrowed from ubiquity fails with error:
AttributeError: 'gtk.VBox' object has no attribute 'present'
if loaded.
This is in the code path inherited from gdm-community-greeter - the debugging is in progress.

## Near-future plans

0. Fix bugs preventing layout widget from loading and connect it with "real" python code talking to xklavier instead of stubs.
0. week #9 plans.

## Additional notes

0. From now on till the end of GSoC every week new version will be tagged in git repo - this should aid with testing.
0. This week is one day shorter due to wedding. Luckily - not my own :)
0. For the same reason weekly meeting is moved to one day earlier.
