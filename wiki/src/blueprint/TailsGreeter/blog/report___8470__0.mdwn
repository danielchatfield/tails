This is the 1st in a series of bi-weekly reports which will follow alongside the implementation of tails-greeter project.

#### Current progress:

- created design document as subpage for TailsGreeter on wiki
- tried building tails iso

#### Problems:

- build fails with various problems on different machines
- build requires root privileges (upstream problem with live-build,  see http://live.debian.net/devel/live-build/todo/ entries for "core")

#### Near-future plans:

- investigate and fix abovementioned problems
- read on .deb packaging
- read on vala (development environment setup and code samples)

#### Additional notes:

This entry will serve as a small test for unicode support of ikiwiki as well - see the numbering in heading :)
