## Current progress:

-    obtain list of kb layouts and variants available (via python-xklavier) - DONE.
-    populate layout widget with kb variants - DONE.
-    merge feature/better_root_access_control branch - DONE.
-    apply correct layout after it's been chosen (both to present and following greeter widgets and to actual session) - postponed.
-    verify that layout switching works after login - postponed
-    version tag and update - DONE.

## Problems:

- tails-greeter is run under gdm's account but altering gdm PostLogon files (to set env variables) or locale compilation via localedef require root privileges.
- xklavier set and check layout without errors but it doesn't affect greeter nor following session.
- better_root_access_control feature requires env. variable to be set which is not possible yet.

## Near-future plans:

- wait for answer from gdm and xklavier devs to figure out workarounds for current problems
- replace 2 widgets with 1 panel with same functionality
- test the result with tails

## Additional notes:

- right now there are 2 "screens" which user moves through by pressing "next" button. That's rather ugly and is planned to be replaced with one of the following:


1) single "screen" with requests for both at the same time

2) 2 "screens" with language and layout requests on first one and admin password request on second one

- Which do you think is better and why?
- Please feel free to discuss it on irc this Saturday during regular meeting time or whenever you'll see max-gsoc
