## Current progress

- convert tails-greeter to old-style pygtk to remove pygi dependecy: [in progress]
- re-test converted version with squeeze: [done, test failed]
- check if current localization handling is suitable for tails-greeter: [postponed]
- make plans for next week: [done]

## Problems

- proper procedure for version increase
- errors with dbus after conversion: access-denied on dbus call
- dpkg-divert required for proper testing
- need easy way to run python syntax quick check on entire file

## Near-future plans

- add dpkg-divert functionality to .deb
- fix errors found after conversion
- run external (placeholder) program with adequate parameters on language change (locale generation for example)
- alter python code with dummy 'admin password requestor'
- add tails-greeter.deb into tails.git (main) repo
- add note that it's dangerous to install tails-greeter.deb :)
