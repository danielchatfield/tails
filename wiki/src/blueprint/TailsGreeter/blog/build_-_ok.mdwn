### Update:

Build takes ages, spits several errors like:

"ERROR: ld.so: object '/usr/lib/libeatmydata/libeatmydata.so' from LD_PRELOAD cannot be preloaded: ignored"

but successfully produce .iso

#### Current status: 
back on track.

#### Near-future plans:
whine until I have access to build-server more powerful than my ancient laptop :-)
