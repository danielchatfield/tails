## Current progress

0. change widget to fit many more languages: from flag icons to scrollable list - partially done (dummy widget only, no python code yet).
0. make .iso build - not done.
0. specify dbus interface to interact with external locale-gen script - not done (see 'Problems' below).
0. change widget exec order (parallel->sequential) to comply with "localization notes" part of [[todo/TailsGreeter/design]] - not done (see 'Problems' below).

## Problems

0. relocation to another country.
0. .iso build fails due to problems with underlying fs, fix testing is in progress.
0. the widget exec order is hardcoded into community-greeter.py so this change requires more time than it was anticipated during previous planning.
0. interaction with locale-gen script  require rewrite of the d-bus code in services.py which cannot be completed during this week as well.

## Near-future plans

0. rewrite d-bus handling in service.py
0. change widget exec order (rewrite community-greeter.py)
0. substitute LanguageWindow widget with LangselectWindow
0. setup squid-deb-proxy to speed-up live-build
0. remainder of week #6 plans from [[todo/TailsGreeter/timeline]]
