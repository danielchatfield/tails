## Current progress:

-   verify that locale is correctly applied to gnome-session and fix if it isn't - DONE.
-   fix layout widget loading - DONE.
-  obtain list of kb layouts and variants available (via python-xklavier) - postponed.
-    populate layout widget with kb variants - postponed.
-    apply correct layout after it's been chosen (both to present and following greeter widgets and to actual session) - postponed.
-    verify that layout switching works after login - postponed.
-    Add option to skip all the greeter screens and immediately login with default settings - DONE.
-    Convey necessary env. variables to gnome session.(echo "VARIABLE=value" >> /etc/amnesia/environment or via /etc/gdm3/PostLogin/)
-    capitalize 1st letter of (latin) language names (e. g. English vs english) - DONE.
-   version tag and update - DONE.


## Problems:

- ISP failure which caused lack of regular updates and report delay
- it's impossible to set env. vars via /etc/gdm3/PostLogin/ - it's writable by root only and greeter is running as 'gdm-user' account
- python-xklavier bindings are incomplete: the most needed function "search_by_pattern" is unavailable.


## Near-future plans:

- find a way to overcome python-xklavier limitations
- Next week plans.

## Additional notes:

- Right now layout widget is dummmy: only "next" button is working. 
- The language choice is applied to session semi-correctly: if there are several country locales correspond to one language (for examle French is Belgium, France etc) than one of them is picked seemingly random. Once there is workaround for xklavier issue than it'll be user choice made based on layout widget.
