People from [Silicon Sentier](http://siliconsentier.org/) proposed to conduct a
usability testing session on Tails.

The starting point is the fact that FOSS projects too often have poor usability
and are not attractive to potential users. They want to play a role in fixing
this, by building a bridge between the designers, graphics artists, and UI
experts community on the one hand, and the FOSS people on the other hand.

Here are a few exercises that we could propose them:

  - Start Tails and end-up in an environment in their favourite language.
  - Chat online with someone else in the room.
    - What is the security level of this conversation? What would you do to improve it?
  - Install software `xyz`.
    - TODO: We would need to write documentation for that first.
  - Access the internal hard disk.
    - TODO: That's probably not documented.
  - Go through the full upgrade mechanism by cloning from others.
  - Go through an incremental upgrade.
  - Create a document and save it encrypted on your Tails USB stick.
  - Find something useful you could do for Tails.
