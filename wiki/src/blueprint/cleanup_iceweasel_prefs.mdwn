# not displayed in about:config

We set these settings in our config files, but they don't appear in about:config:

* xpinstall.whitelist.add.103

# different value in about:config than in our configuration files

## Expected

* `noscript.subscription.lastCheck`: setting this to the TBB's value
  (-142148139) in about:config immediately sets it to
  a positive value.
* `extensions.torbutton.startup`: expected to be set to false, as
  `torbutton_do_startup()` sets this to false after it has done
  its job.
