Can I install other add-ons in the browser?
-------------------------------------------

**Installing add-ons in the browser might break the security built in Tails.**

Add-ons can do anything within the browser, and even if all the networking goes
through Tor, some add-ons might interact badly with the rest of the
configuration or leak private information.

1. They can track and reveal information about your browsing behaviour, browsing
history, or system information, either on purpose or by mistake.

2. They can have bugs and security holes that can be remotely exploited by an
attacker.

4. They can have bugs breaking the security from the other add-ons, for example
Torbutton, and break your anonymity.

5. They can break your anonymity by making your browsing behaviour
distinguishable amongst other Tails users.

No add-on, apart from the ones already included in Tails, have been seriously
audited and should be considered safe to use in this context, unless proven
otherwise.

Does Tails work with 64 bits processors?
----------------------------------------

Tails is a 32 bit operating system. But it also works on 64 bit processors, such
as 64 bit Intel and AMD processors, since they have backwards compatibility with
32 bit.

We are working on a 64 bit version of Tails see [[!tails_ticket 5456]] and
[[!tails_ticket 5835]].

Does Tails work on ARM architecture, Raspberry Pi, or tablets?
--------------------------------------------------------------

For the moment, Tails is only available on the x86 and x86_64 architectures.
The Raspberry Pi and many tablets are based on the ARM architecture. Tails do
not work on the ARM architecture so far.

Look for a tablet with an AMD or Intel processor. Try to verify its
compatibility with Debian beforehand, for example make sure that the Wi-Fi card
is supported.

Can I download using BitTorrent with Tails?
-------------------------------------------

Tails does not ship any BitTorrent software and is unlikely to do so in the
future.

The problem with using BitTorrent over Tor is double:

  - It is technically hard to do it properly, see:
    <https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea>.
  - It harms the network, see:
    <https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow>.

Is it safe to use Tails on a compromised system?
------------------------------------------------

Tails runs independently from the operating system installed on the computer.
So, if the computer has only been compromised by software, running from inside
your operating system (virus, trojan, etc.), it is safe to use Tails. This is
true as long as Tails itself has been installed on a trusted system.

If the computer has been compromised by someone having physical access to it and
who installed untrusted pieces of hardware, then it might not be safe to use
Tails.

Why does tails.boum.org rely on a commercial SSL certificate?
-------------------------------------------------------------

HTTPS provides encryption and authentication on the web. The standard
authentication mechanism through SSL certificates is centralized and based on
commercial or institutional certificate authorities. This mechanism has proven
to be susceptible to various methods of compromise. See our [[warning about
man-in-the-middle attacks|doc/about/warning#man-in-the-middle]].

Still, we use HTTPS on our website and rely on a commercial certificate even if
we acknowledge those security problems.

1. Providing no HTTPS and no kind of encryption would be a worse option.

2. Providing a self-signed certificate or another marginally supported
authentication mechanism would not work for the majority of users. Modern
browsers provide very strong warning when facing a self-signed certificate, and
many people would think the website is broken when it is not.

We prefer to provide weak security, using a commercial certificate, that still
works for most people. At the same time, we make clear this security is limited
and encourage stronger ways of verifying the authenticity of Tails once
downloaded.  See our documentation on [[verifying the ISO|download#verify]].
