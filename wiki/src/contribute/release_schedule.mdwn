Tails has a time-based release schedule, aligned with Firefox ESR
(Extended Support Release) that are put out every 6 weeeks:

* <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases>
* <https://mail.mozilla.com/home/akeybl@mozilla.com/Release%20Management.html>
* <https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/>

Reasons for this switch were [listed on
tails-dev](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-April/001132.html) first.

The idea is to put a major Tails release out every 12 weeks, plus
a point release in between.

What if things go wrong?
========================

Postponing the final release causes problems for those who have
scheduled time for post-release user support, press work, etc..

Also, changing our mind (i.e. releasing a point-release instead of
a major one) => switching minor/major release schedule for the future
is probably not an option either.

So we need to have a pessimistic enough RC->final schedule to handle
unexpected issues.

Reverting the faulty feature branch is an option too.

Having our own [[!tails_todo APT repository]] will remove quite some of the
potential for last minute breakage.

Remaining issues
================

* When to run the test suite: RC1 and/or RC2?
