Evaluation
-----------

### Introduction

As decided in the user support "Great plan for now"
it is now time to evaluate our progress in this area,
especially on these action items:

* tails-support public mailing-list

  We decided to file a ticket for changing the warning for using
  tails-support more informative and not needlessly scary.

  [[!tails_ticket 6409]]

* Collect the frequent questions and answers from the old forum in
  a FAQ on /support/frequently_asked_questions redirected from
  /support/faq.

  Ticket #5893 ([[!tails_ticket 5893]]) has been closed
  as duplicate and ticket #6409 ([[!tails_ticket 6409]])
  assigned to sjaolida.

* Keep on harvesting questions & answers from tails-support to feed
  the FAQ.

Nothing much to say on this. We're sticking to the plan.

### Introduction

[[!tails_ticket 6373]]

### Decision

We decided to set it to low priority and research as type of work.
Strangely enough the ticket seems to have been removed and is not
on Redmine anymore.

Decide what kind of questions go into the FAQ
---------------------------------------------

### Introduction

[[!tails_ticket 6375]]

### Decision

We should start to fill up the FAQ and discuss its content with concrete
decisions to take. Then we will probably decided on general guidelines
for the FAQ. Ticket resolved.

-----------------------------------

### Introduction

[[!tails_ticket 5588]]

### Decision

Ticket has been renamed into Do not create auto-login text consoles


Volunteers to handle broken windows this month?
-----------------------------------------------

### Introduction
 
Our "broken windows" (https://tails.boum.org/contribute/roadmap/#Broken%20window),
are tasks or issues that, ideally,

Our "broken windows" ([[!tails_roadmap]]) are tasks or issues that, ideally,
should have been resolved a while ago, and seeing them still causing
problems is demotivating.

We try to spend a week focusing on broken windows each month.
Recently, most core contributors have been focusing on broken windows
all the time, so we skipped them in practice.

However, if new contributors want to play with us, it may make sense
to revive these specific times.

### Decisions

Our schedule are full enough, we're already focusing on high-priority stuff,
so we won't be focusing on BW.


Monthly low-hanging fruits meeting?
-----------------------------------

### Introduction

Low-hanging fruits meeting: spend a while together on many small tasks
that take less than 2 hours each, and are waiting in our TODO list for
too long.

During these meetings, we exceptionally allow ourselves to do the
review & merge process on IRC instead of the usual email -based
workflow, so this should all go pretty smoothly. Then, we report back
on tails-dev.

We also use these meetings to review stuff that's waiting in
the queue.

### Decisions

We'll have one low-hanging fruits meeting in November:

- Saturday 23 at 10pm CEST
