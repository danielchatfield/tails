Decide if we care about the Pidgin CTCP replies
-----------------------------------------------

### Introduction

* https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6283
* Parent ticket https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5823

Pidgin responds to PING returning a time duration and VERSION returning
'Purple IRC'.

### Decision

We decided none of those answers to CTCP commands are disclosing much
and thus are no big deal for the moment. Tickets are now closed.


Decide on throw keyids
----------------------

### Introduction

* https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6152
* Parent ticket https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6153

--throw-keyids is a GnuPG option that hides the receiver of the encrypted
data as a countermeasure against traffic analysis.
While working on getting Icedove back to Tails, enabling that
option by default, or not, is to discuss.

### Decision

At the monthly meeting, there was a consensus that while --throw-keyids
may be useful sometimes, enabling it by default makes OpenPGP even more
a usability mess than it already is. Even its most verbose proponents
(Torbirdy) stopped enabling it by default recently. So, we won't use this
option in Tails. Closing tickets.


Test suite: retry when tor fails
--------------------------------

### Introduction

https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5770

Some scenarios uses the live Tor network, which is not entirely reliable,
so we may get failing scenarios when in fact we just happened to pick a
Tor circuit that's too slow, or even one that's broken but Tor fails to
remedy the situation.

### Decision

Our plate is full enough, let's not try to fix problems we have never
seen in the wild. If the need arises in the wild, we'll reopen.
In the meantime, let's focus on problems we can experience more widely.
Closing ticket.


Broken window week
------------------

### Introduction

Our "broken windows" (https://tails.boum.org/contribute/roadmap/,
sorry for the crappy reference) are tasks or issues that, ideally,
should have been resolved a while ago, and seeing them still causing
problems is demotivating.

We try to spend a week focusing on broken windows each month.
Recently, most core contributors have been focusing on broken windows
all the time, so we skipped them in practice.

However, if new contributors want to play with us, it may make sense
to revive these specific times.

### Decisions

Our schedule are full enough, we're already focusing on high-priority stuff,
so we won't be focusing on BW.

Monthly low-hanging fruits meeting?
-----------------------------------

### Introduction

Low-hanging fruits meeting: spend a while together on many small tasks
that take less than 2 hours each, and are waiting in our TODO list for
too long.

During these meetings, we exceptionally allow ourselves to do the
review & merge process on IRC instead of the usual email -based
workflow, so this should all go pretty smoothly. Then, we report back
on tails-dev.

We also use these meetings to review stuff that's waiting in
the queue.

### Decisions

We'll have two low-hanging fruits meetings in October:

- Saturday 12 at 6pm CEST
- Tuesday 15 at 6pm CEST
