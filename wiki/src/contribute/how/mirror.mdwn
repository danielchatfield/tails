BitTorrent
==========

It's really easy to help Tails users downloading it over BitTorrent...
especially if you are already a BitTorrent user.

1. Get the latest BitTorrent files
----------------------------------

Here are the latest available BitTorrent files:

[[!map pages="torrents/files/*.torrent"]]

2. Share Tails images
---------------------

Feed your preferred BitTorrent client with the `.torrent` files
downloaded at the previous step. Make sure you open and/or forward the
needed ports in your router and/or firewall configuration so that you
are a real seed.

3. Stay tuned!
--------------

As a contributor to Tails availability over BitTorrent, it is very
important you share the very latest published version, and only this
one: users need to be able to quickly download it and upgrade when we
release security fixes, and there is no need to help propagate
outdated versions with security flaws.

HTTP
====

To efficiently help Tails users downloading it over HTTP, one needs to
have sufficiently privileged access to a web server with decent
bandwidth: a domestic DSL connection won't help; neither will a shared
web hosting setup that provides FTP access only.

This being said, if you satisfy these practical requirements, please
read on, you are most welcome aboard!

Before starting doing any real work on this topic, you should probably
get in touch (<tails@boum.org>) and send us your OpenPGP public key
so that any further communication between us can be properly encrypted.

1. The big picture
------------------

We have a DNS Round Robin setup for the `dl.amnesia.boum.org` host.

Every HTTP mirror makes our files available under a fixed URL
(`http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/`) that contains per-version
sub-directories (such as
`http://dl.amnesia.boum.org/tails/stable/tails-i386-lenny-0.6.2/`).

2. Setup your web server
------------------------

You need to setup a VirtualHost with dl.amnesia.boum.org as the
ServerName and indexing enabled. Here is an example Apache
configuration:

	<VirtualHost YOUR_WEBSERVER_IP:80>
	   ServerName dl.amnesia.boum.org
	   ServerAdmin YOUR_EMAIL
	
	   DocumentRoot /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/
	   <Directory /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/>
	      Options Indexes
	      AllowOverride None
	      IndexIgnore README.html
	      IndexOptions FancyIndexing FoldersFirst IgnoreCase NameWidth=50
	      IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
	   </Directory>
	</VirtualHost>

3. Download the files
---------------------

Download a snapshot of the current Tails files:

	rsync -r archive.torproject.org::amnesia-archive \
	         /var/www/THE_PLACE_WHERE_YOU_WANT_OUR_FILES_TO_LIVE/

4. Schedule the pulling of Tails files
--------------------------------------

Secondary mirrors (like yours) should at least sync at 01:00 UTC.
This process shall obviously be scheduled using cron or equivalent.

5. Go wild
----------

As soon as your web server is ready, please e-mail us its IP address
so that we can ask the DNS server admins to add it to the Round Robin
pool.
