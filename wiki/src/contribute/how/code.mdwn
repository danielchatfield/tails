# Forewords

## Why should I read this page?

Every Free Software project's development process is a bit different
from the others. If you don't understand its development process, it
is generally pretty hard for you to contribute in a way that is both
efficient and joyful for you... and for its current core development
team. This document is meant to help *you* understand what you need so
that you can more efficiently and joyfully contribute to Tails.

## Focus on low-effort maintainability

Many, many Live CD projects — including a few privacy-targeted ones —
have lived fast and died young. We explain this on the one hand by
their being one wo/man efforts, on the other hand by design decisions
that made their maintenance too much costly timewise and energywise.

We want Tails to live as long as it is needed: Tails is not meant to
solely be a pet project.

Since the early days of this project (i.e. early 2009), ease of
maintenance on the long run has been a major factor in any decision we
have made. Nowadays Tails is more alive and kicking than it has ever
been, and we feel this would have been impossible without
 this kind of mindset.

Our focus on low-effort maintainability has practical consequences.

First of all, we tend to **carry the smallest possible delta** with
our upstreams (i.e. upstream software, the Debian distribution, and
the Debian Live build tools). Pretty important details about this can
be found in our [[contribute/relationship_with_upstream]] statement
rather than repeated here.

Second, we try **not to reinvent the wheel** too often, and flea the
*Not Invented Here* syndrome like the pest. This implies very few code
is actually written specifically for Tails: most of what we call
"code" work on Tails is more similar to system administration than it
is to programming: we mainly glue existing pieces together; when we
happen to need a feature that no software provides yet, we tend to
choose the best among existing tools and do whatever is needed to get
the needed feature upstream... which may, or may not, be writing a
patch ourselves.

# How to get started

## Pick up a task

This wiki is used as a basic bug tracking system: we use it to manage
our [[todo]] and [[bugs]] lists as well as our [[contribute/roadmap]].
If you already know which one of the listed tasks you want to fulfill
*and it is only tagged `todo/code`*, you can probably safely skip to
the next section.

So you want to contribute code to Tails but do not know where to start
with. Our TODO list is huge and frightening, but...

*Do not panic!*

Let's see how we can help you picking up a task. A few tips:

* Choose something that matters for you, such as fixing that bug that
  annoys you so much or implementing this feature you are missing so
  hard.
* Choose something where your singular skills and knowledge are put to
  work.
* Have a look to the [[easy tasks|todo/easy]] list: there is
  something, in each of these tasks, that one can do right away since
  it does not require deep knowledge of the Tails internals.

On the one hand, you may want to **start doing practical stuff
immediately**. In this case, see the tasks tagged `todo/code` on the
[[/TODO]] list. You probably want to start looking at the few ones
that are also in the [[easy tasks|todo/easy]] list first so that you
can gain confidence and we can smoothly learn to work together.

On the other hand, you may prefer **picking up a task that requires
some initial thought and discussion** before rushing to your
`$EDITOR`. In this case, you probably want to look at the [[providing
needed input|contribute/how/input]] guidelines.

## Get in touch with our past, present and future

So you know what bug you want to fix, what feature you want to
implement.

Duplicated, unfinished or otherwise unusable work makes us sad, so
unless you are sure it is really trivial you should:

1. **Gather results of previous research and discussions.** Search
   this wiki and the [developers mailing-list
   archive](https://boum.org/mailman/pipermail/tails-dev) for previous
   discussions on the topic you are interested in;
   [[some|todo/macchanger]] [[tasks|todo/usb_install_and_upgrade]] are
   much harder to get right than one could initially expect, and you'd
   better get you a taste of how hard what you want to implement
   really is.
2. **[[Tell us|talk-dev]] about your plans.** This helps making sure
   your idea fits nicely into the [[big picture|contribute/design]])
   and nobody is currently working on the same task.

# Hack

Tails is developed using a set of [[Git repositories|git]]. You
probably want to base your work on the `devel` branch. If unsure, feel
free to ask us.

Please think of how you will actually submit your work to us
**before** you have changed 20 files for 10 different reasons ;) In
other words, every commit shall implement one change and be labelled
with a commit message that clearly expresses the rationale of your
changes. This is needed so that we are able to review your work
without too much pain: just explain every proposed change to us
(almost) the same way as if you would explain it to anyone who lacks
the background.

# Submit your work

Before diving into technical details please consider reading our
(quite short) [[contribute/merge policy]].

You can submit small, easy changes as Git patches (prepared with the
`git format-patch` command) over [[email|talk-dev]] or post on the
[[patches page|patch]].

For bigger, harder changes that will might require a few review/fix
cycles before being merged in, it's better if you ask us to review and
pull your work from a dedicated Git topic branch. If you already know
where to host your personal repository in a public online place, this
is great; else you may want to [fork us on
repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git).

FIXME: mob branch on repo.or.cz? mob repository where anyone can
create and push `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` branches?

# Want more?

## Follow Tails development

Still here? Well, it seems you're not of the patch-in-a-hurry'n'forget
kind.

You probably want to subscribe to the [tails-dev mailing
list](https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-dev/) then. Maybe even
subscribe to this website's RSS feed (see the [[recentchanges]] page)
and/or track the Git commits (using [[our Gitweb|git]]'s RSS
features). And probably read Tails [[specification and security design
document|contribute/design]].

## Building images

You probably want to test your changes before contributing them back;
this may require you to [[build an ISO image|build]]. This step is
also needed if you need to [[customize]] Tails.
