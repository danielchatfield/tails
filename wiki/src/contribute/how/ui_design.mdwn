# Known tasks

We have identified some things that we would like to see improved on
our website: see the [user interface design-related
tasks](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=123)
on Redmine.

# Other ideas

Nevertheless, if you are a web or graphics person, you can surely
find other ideas to improve the Tails user interface! Even if you don't plan
to implement every suggested enhancement yourself, it may be worth
[creating
tickets](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues/new) with
your ideas so that others can benefit from your insight.
