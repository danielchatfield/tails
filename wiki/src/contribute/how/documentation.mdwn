# Reporting errors

We do value documentation very much, but it's difficult to keep it
up-to-date. If you find a typo or an error in the documentation please
do let us know â€” ideally, by submitting a patch with your fix.

# Writing

The easiest documentation tasks may be found by looking at documentation section on the [[TODO|todo#documentation]] list (items tagged `todo/documentation`). Small fixes and
enhancements are greatly welcome, and can be done either directly in
this wiki's web interface, by [[sending us|contribute/talk]] Git patches, or
by publishing a [[Git]] branch.

But there is more: Tails [[end-user documentation|doc]] needs lots
of work. A plan was thought through and sent to the [Tails development
mailing-list](https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-dev/) on Thu, 17
Feb 2011. Documentation writers coordinate themselves using our usual
[[development communication channels|contribute/talk]]. On the technical
side, a dedicated `doc-rework` [[Git]] branch has been setup to host
this work.

# Translating

We want Tails [[end-user documentation|doc]] to be translated in
as many languages as possible. See the [[guidelines for
translators|contribute/how/translate]] for details.
