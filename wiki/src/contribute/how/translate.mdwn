# Things to translate

## Custom programs

Tails ships with several custom programs that need to be translated.

One can find the (gettext) PO files:

* in [[!tails_devel_gitweb_dir config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/locale]]
* [liveusb-creator
  gitweb](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/liveusb-creator.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
* [tails-greeter
  gitweb](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
* [tails-persistence-setup
  gitweb](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/persistence-setup.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)

## Website and documentation

The [[end-user documentation|doc]] is being reorganized and rewritten. You can
have a look at the [[todo/documentation_translation]] page to know which pages
are ready to be translated.

## Other text to be translated

See the *Translate* section of the [[/TODO]] list.

# For English native speakers

Most of Tails' developers are not native English speakers so you're also more than
welcome to edit, rephrase, correct or improve our English. Since you won't be
able to use translation tools for that but rather edit the original code or wiki
pages your best option will be using Git to submit patches.

# Translation tools

## Web interface

One can translate pages on this website using the web interface: there
is an *Improve translation* button on the top right of every page that
is a translation. It is nice for quick tasks such as un-fuzzying
a recently changed string or fixing a typo; on the other hand, most
translators find it painful and error-prone for more serious
translation work.

Moreover, parts of Tails (most notably our custom programs) cannot be
translated using the web interface. We therefore recommend anyone
willing to seriously get involved into Tails translation work to use
more appropriate tools, such as a real PO file editor; see below for
details.

## Locked pages

Some pages on this website are 'locked' and cannot be edited through the web
interface. Those are pages we considered too sensitive for open editing: the
Download page, the page about our GnuPG key, etc. For those pages you will need
to use Git to send us your work.

## PO editor

The [Poedit](http://poedit.sourceforge.net/) editor is installed in
Tails.

Many different workflows can be used to translate Tails strings
using a PO editor. Let's describe a few recommended ones, from the
smallest to the biggest initial setup time... the last ones actually
being the most comfortable to work with in the long run.

### Piggy-back the web interface

1. In the web interface, click the *Improve translation* button on the
   page you wish to translate.
2. In the text edition web page, copy the whole text.
3. Paste it into a new, empty raw text document.
4. Save this text document as a file whose name ends with the `.po`
   extension.
5. Open the `.po` file in your preferred PO file editor.
6. Translate whatever you can.
7. Paste back the whole resulting text into your web browser.
8. Preview your changes.
9. Click *Save* when satisfied with the results.

### Using Git

You can either send us Git patches or ask us to pull from your Git
branch.

Note that the website shall be translated in the `master` branch,
while custom Tails programs live in the `devel` branch.

#### Send us Git patches

1. Clone Tails [[Git repository|contribute/git]] onto your local system.
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified .po 
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Use the `git format-patch` command to prepare patches.
5. [[Send us|contribute/talk]] your patches.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

#### Ask us to pull from your Git branch

1. Setup your personal [[Git repository|contribute/git]]: if you already know
   where to host it in a public place, this is great; or else [fork us
   on repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git).
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified .po 
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Push your changes to your online Git repository.
5. [[Ask us|contribute/talk]] to pull from the branch you worked on.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

# Supported languages

Currently, only a few languages are somewhat supported in Tails,
namely:  Arabic, Chinese, English, Farsi, French, Italian, German,
Portuguese, Russian, Spanish (Castellano) and Vietnamese.

Support for only a subset of these languages is enabled on this
website.

Adding support for your preferred language is possible, but beware:

* our website text evolves relatively quickly;
* useful translations are no one-shot job and need to be maintained on
  the long run, which may take roughly two hours a month.

In conclusion, forming a team of translators dedicated to your
language's support in Tails might be useful to make the maintenance
work happier and more sustainable.
