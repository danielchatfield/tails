# Things to translate

## Custom programs

Tails ships with several custom programs that need to be translated.

The (gettext) PO files are in [[!tails_devel_gitweb_dir
config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/locale]].

## Website and documentation

The [[end-user documentation|support]] is being reorganized, please
coordinate with documentation writers before translating content that
may, or may not, evolve quickly: see [[contribute/how/documentation]].

## Other strings

See the *Translate* section of the [[/TODO]] list.

# Translation tools

## Web interface

Using the web interface (*Improve translation* button) is nice for
quick tasks such as un-fuzzying a recently changed string or fixing a
typo; on the other hand, most translators find it painful and
error-prone for more serious translation work.

Moreover, parts of Tails (most notably our custom programs) cannot be
translated using the web interface. We therefore recommend anyone
willing to seriously get involved into Tails translation work to use
more appropriate tools, such as a real PO file editor; see bellow for
details.

## PO editor

The [Poedit](http://poedit.sourceforge.net/) editor is installed in
Tails.

Many different workflows could be used to translate Tails strings
using a PO editor. Let's describe a few recommended ones, from the
smallest to the biggest initial setup time... the last ones actually
being the most comfortable to work with on the long run.

### Piggy-back the web interface

1. In the web interface, click the *Improve translation* button on the
   page you wish to translate.
2. In the text edition web page, copy the whole text.
3. Paste it into a new, empty raw text document.
4. Save this text document as a file whose name ends with the `.po`
   extension.
5. Open the `.po` file in your preferred PO file editor.
6. Translate whatever you can.
7. Paste back the whole resulting text into your web browser.
8. Preview your changes.
9. Click *Save* when satisfied with the results.

### Using Git

You can either send us Git patches or ask us to pull from your Git
branch.

Note that the website shall be translated in the `master` branch,
while custom Tails programs live in the `devel` branch.

#### Send us Git patches

1. Clone Tails [[Git repository|git]] onto your local system.
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
4. Use the `git format-patch` command to prepare patches.
5. [[Send us|talk-dev]] your patches.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

#### Ask us to pull from your Git branch

1. Setup [[Git repository|git]]: if you already know where to host
   your personal Git repository in a public place, this is great; else
   [fork us on repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git).
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
4. Push your changes to your online Git repository.
5. [[Ask us|talk-dev]] to pull from the branch(es) you worked on.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

# Supported languages

Only a few languages are currently somehow supported in Tails, namely:
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Russian
and Spanish (Castellano).

Support for only a subset of these languages is enabled on this
website.

Adding support for your preferred language is possible, but beware:

* our website text evolves relatively quickly;
* useful translations are no one-shot job and need to be maintained on
  the long run, which may take roughly two hours a month.

As a conclusion, forming a translators team dedicated to your
language's support in Tails might be useful to make the maintenance
work happier and more sustainable.
