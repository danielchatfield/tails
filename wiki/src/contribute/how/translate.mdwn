# For English native speakers

Most of Tails developers are not native English speakers so you're more than welcome to edit, rephrase, correct or improve our English. For this, you can use the web interface of the wiki or follow one of the methods explained below.

# Translating Tails

If you are a native speaker of one of the languages available on this website,
you can help on correcting, improving or completing the translations that are
already available in Tails.

Many different workflows can be used to translate Tails.
This section describes some options, from the fastest to start working
to the more comfortable to work with in the long run.

## Online translation with Transifex

Our [[custom programs|contribute/git]] can be translated directly online with 
[Transifex](http://help.transifex.com/intro/translating.html#translating):

- [Tails 
Greeter](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-tails-tails-greeter-pot/)
- [Tails Persistence 
Setup](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-tails-tails-persistence-setup-pot/)
- [Tails USB 
Installer](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-tails-liveusb-creator-pot/)
- [Whisperback](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-whisperback-whisperback-pot/)


<a id="download-po-files"></a>

## Download the PO files and send us your version

The translation system used by both the custom programs and the
website is called <span class="application">[[!wikipedia
gettext]]</span>. Every sentence that needs to be translated is written in a [PO 
file](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#PO-Files).

To edit these PO files, we recommend you to use <span
class="application">[Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/screenshots.php)</span> a 
cross-platform editor for PO
files. <span class="application">Poedit</span> is included in Tails.

**For each custom program**, you can download the PO files via 
[[Transifex|translate#transifex]] or gitweb:

  - Tails Greeter:
    [PO 
files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD),
    see also the [README for 
translators](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/tails-greeter.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.translators;hb=HEAD)
  - Tails Persistence Setup:
    [PO 
files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/persistence-setup.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
  - Tails USB Installer:
    [PO 
files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=tails/liveusb-creator.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD)
  - Whisperback:
    [PO files](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=whisperback.git;a=tree;f=po;hb=HEAD),
    see also the [README for 
translators](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=whisperback.git;a=blob_plain;f=README.translators;hb=HEAD)
  - Some smaller programs written for Tails: [[!tails_devel_gitweb_dir config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/locale desc="PO files"]]
  - [[!tails_devel_gitweb_dir config/chroot_local-includes/etc/skel/Desktop desc="The launchers on the desktop"]], are not PO files, and includes directly the translations



**For the website**, you can browse its [source code via 
gitweb](http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=tree;f=wiki/src)
as well. Each page is translated in a specific PO file.

If there is no existing PO file for your language, you can copy and rename the 
corresponding
`.pot` file into a `.po` file.

Once your translation work is done, you can send it by email to the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#tails-l10n]].

<a id="git"></a>

## Using Git

You can get updated versions of the source code, and its PO files, using
[[Git|contribute/git]].

You can also take advantage of Git to send us you work, either by
sending us Git patches or by asking us to pull from your Git branch.

Note that the website shall be translated in the `master` branch,
while custom Tails programs live in the `devel` branch.

### Send us Git patches

1. Clone Tails [[Git repository|contribute/git]] onto your local system.
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified `.po`
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Use the `git format-patch` command to prepare patches.
5. Send your patches on the [[mailing list for 
translators|translate#tails-l10n]].
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

### Ask us to pull from your Git branch

1. Setup your personal [[Git repository|contribute/git]]: if you already know
   where to host it in a public place, this is great; or else [fork us
   on repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git).
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
   You could encounter numerous false positive when committing modified `.po`
   files. It's due to the fact that Poedit [doesn't handle the wordwrapping 
   correctly](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25). In order to avoid this, 
   you should run the following command :
     `msgcat --width=80 -o your_output_file.po your_input_file.po`
4. Push your changes to your online Git repository.
5. Ask on the [[mailing list for translators|translate#tails-l10n]]
   to pull from the branch you worked on.
6. Frequently merge changes from our main repository into yours.

# The mailing list for translators

Regular translators and translating teams coordinate themselves on the
tails-l10n mailing list (*l10n* stands for [[!wikipedia Software_localization 
desc="localization"]]).

Please <a href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n/'>subscribe</a> to
the list if you want to become a regular translator.

Any message sent to this list is stored in a [public 
archive](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/), so beware
of what your email content and headers reveal about yourself: location,
IP address, email subject and content, etc.


# Add support for a new language

For Tails to be available in a new language, both the website and the custom
programs need to be translated. Please keep in mind that this represents quite a
lot of work.

Therefore, here are a few things that would be required in order to start
translating Tails to a new language:

1. It is really required to be a team of translators and not a single person.
That also allows for peer reviews between the team, more flexibility for example
when an important deadline arrives.

2. At least part of the team should subscribe to the [[mailing list for 
translators|translate#tails-l10n]]

3. Since the content of the website is sensitive in terms of privacy
protection, Tails developers need to establish contacts with trusted people
to review the work from time to time.

4. Keep in mind that useful translations need to be maintained in the long run.
This maybe takes a few hours a month.

Once those conditions are fulfilled, the new team can start working on a first
batch of translations.

  - Some of our custom programs:
    - [[Tails Greeter|contribute/git#tails-greeter]]
    - [[Tails Persistence Setup|contribute/git#tails-persistence-setup]]
    - [[Tails USB Installer|contribute/git#liveusb-creator]]
    - [[Whisperback|contribute/git#whisperback]]

  - Important parts of our website:

    - [[/index]]
    - [[/about]] page
    - [[/getting_started]] page
    - [[/support]] page
    - [[/download]] page
    - [[/doc/about]] section
    - [[/doc/first_steps]] section

Do not hesitate to report the progress of your work on the [[mailing list for 
translators|translate#tails-l10n]].

# Follow-up on translation needs

Important changes to the documentation are notified on the [[mailing list for 
translators|contribute/how/translate#tails-l10n]]. You can consult its
[archive](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/) to search for
recent translation requests. See also the [[translate section of our todo 
list|todo/#translate]].

The [[documentation section of our todo list|todo/#documentation]]
lists a number of pages that need improvement. They should be rewritten
at some point, and are of low priority as far as translation work is
concerned.
