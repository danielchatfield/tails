<p>Willing to make using Tails easier in your own language?
Welcome aboard!</p>

# For native English speakers

Most of Tails developers are not native English speakers so you're
more than welcome to correct or improve our English.
For this, you can follow one of the methods explained below.
XXX: check which method really works these days (e.g. Transifex does not).

# Translate Tails

You can help correct, improve, or complete the translations of Tails
programs and documentation into your native language.

The workflow you can use to translate Tails depends on how existing
translators for your native language do:

* **For French and Portuguese (Brazil)**, the existing translators
  team uses Git. So, read [[translating with Git|translate#git]].
* **For other languages**, read [[translating with
  Transifex|translate#transifex]].

## With Transifex

### Custom programs

Our [[custom programs|contribute/git]] can be translated directly online with 
[Transifex](http://help.transifex.com/intro/translating.html#translating):

- [Tails 
Greeter](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-tails-tails-greeter-pot/)
- [Tails Persistence 
Setup](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-tails-tails-persistence-setup-pot/)
- [Tails USB 
Installer](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-tails-liveusb-creator-pot/)
- [Whisperback](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/torproject/resource/3-whisperback-whisperback-pot/)

### Launchers and small programs

XXX: this is going to move to Transifex too soon, so there's probably
no need to document the old way here.

launchers and small programs: set up a team / peer-review,
d/l PO files and them us your version... or perhaps use Git?

- Some smaller programs written for Tails: [[!tails_devel_gitweb_dir
  po desc="PO files"]].

Once your translation work is done, you can email it to the
[[mailing list for translators|translate#tails-l10n]].

### Website

XXX: -> [[translate#new-language]]

<a id="git"></a>

## Translation team using Git

On the long run, translators team often decide to use Git to share and
synchronize their work, and ask us to integrate it within the
official repositories.

### What can be translated

Various bits of texts can be translated:

* **Custom programs** (Tails Greeter, Tails Persistence Setup, Tails
  USB Installer and Whisperback): each one has its own [[Git
  repository|contribute/git]], where PO files live in the `po`
  directory. Some have a `README.translators` at the root of their
  source tree: please read it.
* **Various sets of translatable strings** that live in the `po`
  directory, in the `devel`
  branch of the [[main Tails Git repository|contribute/Git]].
* **This website** must be translated in the `master` branch
  of the [[main Tails Git repository|contribute/Git]].

### gettext

XXX: move gettext intro elsewhere? people using Git need it too.

The translation system used by both the custom programs and the
website is called <span class="application">[[!wikipedia
gettext]]</span>. Every sentence that needs to be translated is written in a [PO 
file](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#PO-Files).

To edit these PO files, we recommend that you use <span
class="application">[Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/screenshots.php)</span>, a
cross-platform editor for PO
files. <span class="application">Poedit</span> is included in Tails.

If there is no existing PO file for your language, you can copy and rename the 
corresponding
`.pot` file into a `.po` file.

### Workflow

You can take advantage of Git to send us your work by asking us to
pull from your Git branch. Here is the typical workflow used by Tails
translators teams:

1. Set up your personal [[Git repository|contribute/git]]: if you already know
   where to host it in a public place, this is great; or else [fork us
   on repo.or.cz](http://repo.or.cz/w/tails.git).
2. Translate whatever you can in your preferred PO file editor. 
3. Commit the changes you made to `.po` files.
4. Merge our main repository into yours.
5. Push your changes to your online Git repository.
6. Ask other members of your translation team to review your work.
7. The reviewer, once happy with the result, should asks on the
   [[mailing list for translators|translate#tails-l10n]] to pull from
   the branch that was worked on.

### Team duties

Our custom programs can be translated [[using
Transifex|translate#transifex]]. Work done there is not automatically
synchronized with the translations your team does in Git.

It is nice to minimize time wasted by unknown people who work, with
Transifex, on the same thing as your translation team.

So, a translation team using Git should regularly contact Transifex
translators (listed in the `Last-translator` field of the PO files one
can download from Transifex), either over email or using the Transifex
interface, to:

1. Thank them for translating Tails stuff.
1. Make it clear their work is not imported (and is therefore, well,
   useless).
1. Invite them to join the team and share the team's
   preferred workflow.
1. Invite them to subscribe to [[the mailing list for
   translators|translate#tails-l10n]].

# The mailing list for translators

Regular translators and translating teams coordinate on the
tails-l10n mailing list (*l10n* stands for [[!wikipedia Software_localization 
desc="localization"]]).

Please <a href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n/'>subscribe</a> to
the list if you want to become a regular translator.

Any message sent to this list is stored in a [public 
archive](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/), so beware
of what your email content and headers reveal about yourself: location,
IP address, email subject and content, etc.

# Add support for a new language

For Tails to be available in a new language, both the website and the
custom programs need to be translated. Please keep in mind that this
represents quite a lot of work.

Therefore, here are a few things that would be required in order to start
translating Tails to a new language:

1. A team of translators, not just one person, is necessary. That also
   allows for peer reviews between the team, more flexibility for
   example when an important deadline arrives.

2. At least part of the team should subscribe to the [[mailing list
   for translators|translate#tails-l10n]]

3. Since the content of the website is sensitive in terms of privacy
   protection, Tails developers need to establish contacts with
   trusted people to review the work from time to time.

4. For translations to be useful, they need to be maintained in the
   long run. This maybe takes a few hours a month.

Once those conditions are fulfilled, the new team can start working on a first
batch of translations.

  - Some of our custom programs:
    - [[Tails Greeter|contribute/git#tails-greeter]]
    - [[Tails Persistence Setup|contribute/git#tails-persistence-setup]]
    - [[Tails USB Installer|contribute/git#liveusb-creator]]
    - [[Whisperback|contribute/git#whisperback]]

  - Important parts of our website:

    - [[/doc/first_steps]] section

Do not hesitate to report the progress of your work on the [[mailing list for 
translators|translate#tails-l10n]].

# Follow-up on translation needs

Important changes to the documentation are announced on the [[mailing list for
translators|contribute/how/translate#tails-l10n]]. You can consult its
[archive](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/) to search for
recent translation requests. See also the translate section of [[!tails_todo ""
desc="our todo list"]].

The documentation section of  [[!tails_todo "" desc="our todo list"]]
lists a number of pages that need improvement. They should be rewritten
at some point, and are of low priority as far as translation work is
concerned.
