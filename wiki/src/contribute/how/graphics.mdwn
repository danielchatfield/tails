# Known tasks

We have identified some things that we would benefit from graphic
designers: see the [graphic design-related
tasks](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=124)
on Redmine.

# Other ideas

Nevertheless, if you are a graphics person, you can surely
find other ideas to make Tails better! Even if you don't plan
to implement every suggested enhancement yourself, it may be worth
[creating
tickets](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues/new) with
your ideas so that others can benefit from your insight.
