[[!meta title="Provide needed input to developers"]]

Some Tails planned features require initial tests, thought and/or
discussion before actual implementation work can start. You may want
to contribute to this effort.

*Do not panic!* Some of this preparation work can be done by people
who lack the technical skills needed to actually implement the desired
feature.

Tasks that are currently stalled by the need for input are listed in
the *Research*, *Discuss*, *QA* and *Test* sections of the [[/TODO]] list.
You probably want to start looking at the ones that are also in the
[[!tails_todo easy desc="easy tasks list"]] first so that you can gain confidence...
and we can smoothly learn to work together.
