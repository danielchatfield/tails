Warn users when running inside a VM
===================================

We tell users, when running inside a VM, that they are implicitly
trusting both the VM software *and* the host OS. This is needed to
avoid creating a false sense of security, which is often quite worse
as no security and a clear sense of it.

This warning is implemented using the desktop notification
system (like our existing security flaw notification).

The detection is delegated to
[virt-what](http://packages.qa.debian.org/v/virt-what.html).

A bit more work is [[left to do|todo/virtualization_support]].

Implementation notes
--------------------

How to detect we're running inside a VM?

### imvirt

* [homepage](http://micky.ibh.net/~liske/imvirt.html)
* [Perl module](http://packages.debian.org/libimvirt-perl) and
  [executable](http://packages.debian.org/imvirt) are packaged in
  Squeeze

Test results:

- executable: the Squeeze one, installed as-is on Lenny, fails to
  detect it is running inside VirtualBox
- Perl module: untested yet => [[!taglink todo/test]]

### virt-what

* [homepage](http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-what/)
* [packaged in Debian](http://packages.qa.debian.org/v/virt-what.html)
* installable as-is on Lenny; only test run was successful: it detects
  VirtualBox

### Sys::Detect::Virtualization

Dave O'Neill has [compiled detection
tricks](http://www.dmo.ca/blog/detecting-virtualization-on-linux/),
based on which he has written the [Sys::Detect::Virtualization Perl
module](http://search.cpan.org/~doneill/Sys-Detect-Virtualization/).
This module is not in Debian, but should be easy enough to package
thanks to `dh-make-perl`.

As of 0.105 it does not support VirtualBox.
