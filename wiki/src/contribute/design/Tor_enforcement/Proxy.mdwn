Polipo provides with caching HTTP proxy functionality. It contacts the
Tor software via SOCKS5 to make the real connections: [[!tails_gitweb
config/chroot_local-includes/etc/polipo/config]].

In case the firewall is buggy or not properly started, proxy settings
are used as part of a defence in depth strategy:

- The standard `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables are
  globally set in [[!tails_gitweb
  config/chroot_local-includes/etc/environment]] to point to Polipo.
- The GNOME proxy settings point to Polipo or to the Tor SOCKS proxy,
  depending on the application type: [[!tails_gitweb
  config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/amnesia/gconf/gnome_proxy.xml]]
  is imported into GConf at build time.
