[[!meta title="MAC address anonymization"]]

**WARNING!**

**This is a not implemented yet.**

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a random MAC address may improve anonymity with respect to the
LAN and prevent mapping the user to a specific physical location.

The macchanger program can be used to change the network card MAC
addresses to a partially random value. Effort should be made to avoid
drawing attention to the changed MAC address in case someone is
watching.

This functionality should not be enabled by default as some DHCP
servers may be configured with specific MAC addresses. An early boot
menu should allow enabling this feature.

#### Partially random MAC address generation

macchanger provides the `-r` option that uses a fully random MAC
address. This would be a very bad choice since the probability of
getting a non-existing vendor ID is at best (according to my
calculations based on the number of registered vendors listed by
macchanger and the fact that the vendor part of the MAC is 24 bits)
99.92%. Moreover that doesn't take into account that many of the
registered vendors haven't produced a card in decades, if ever. In
other words, setting a fully randomized MAC address would most of the
time loudly advertize the use of macchanger, if not the use of
Tails.

The `-a` and `-A` options fixes the bigger of the two problems, i.e.
macchanger makes sure that the vendor ID is not bogus. It doesn't take
into account that some vendors haven't made a NIC since 1984, and that
some are just plain uncommon (macchanger seems to choose among from
it's vendor list with an uniform probability distribution).

Tails should then randomly choose a vendor only among the 20
or so most common ones, and then randomise the ending of the MAC
address with the `-e` option.

Note that there are separate vendor IDs for wireless NICs, so that
would have to be accounted for too.
