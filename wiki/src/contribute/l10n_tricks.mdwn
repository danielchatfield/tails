Compare the content of two PO files
===================================

Here is how to check out the differences between two PO files without
caring about strings order, line breaks or comments.

    diff -u <(msgfmt -o - translation/es/es.po | msgunfmt) \
            <(msgfmt -o - persistence-setup/po/es.po | msgunfmt)

The syntax is bash specific. Replace the paths to the two PO files you
are interested in comparing.

Calculate statistics on the translations
========================================

Run the [[language statistics.sh]] script.
