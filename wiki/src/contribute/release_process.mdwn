See [[release_process/Debian_security_updates]].

Update included files
=====================

AdBlock patterns
----------------

upgrade bundled binary Debian packages
--------------------------------------

Make sure the bundles binary Debian packages are up-to-date,
particularly wrt. included localization files:

* liveusb-creator
* tails-greeter
* tails-persistence-setup
* whisperback (see `whisperback_completed` branch
  in `git://git.torproject.org/translation.git`)

Changelog
---------

	./release NEW_VERSION PREVIOUS_RELEASED_TAG

example:

	./release 0.3 0.2

This populates the Changelog with the Git log entries.

Now cleanup some parts of it (semi-)automatically:

	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \[ IkiWiki::Plugin::po::change \]\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \* updated PO files\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \* \n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \[ 127\.0\.0\.1 \]\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \[ amnesia \]\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \[ anonym \]\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \[ T\(A\)ILS developers \]\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \[ Tails developers \]\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \[ Tails \]\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \* Added a comment\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \* Added a comment:.*\n//' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \* todo\+\+\n//i' debian/changelog
	perl -pi'' -e 's/\A  \* todo--\n//i' debian/changelog


... then launch an editor for the needed cleanup of the result.

included website
----------------

Merge the `master` branch into the one used to build the release.

### version number

In the branch used to build the release, update the `inc/*{date,url,version}.html` files to
match the *version number* and *date* of the new release.

### features and design documentation

Read the Changelog carefully, and update the [[contribute/design]] and
[[doc/about/features]] pages accordingly.

Also:

	git grep PENDING wiki/src/contribute/design*

... and remove the `PENDING-FOR-N.M` warnings.

Build images
============

[[Build images|contribute/build]] and carefully read the build logs to make sure
nothing bad happened.

SquashFS files order
--------------------

**Beware**: skip this step, or double check (as in, benchmark) the
results until [[bugs/weird_squashfs.sort_entries]] is fixed.

Build an ISO image, profile it **on bare metal** and update
`squashfs.order` in the Git repository. Then rebuild images.

See [[todo/improve_boot_time_on_cd]] for details.

Testing
=======

Until [[todo/automated_builds_and_tests]] are setup, some manual testing
has to be done by the persons preparing the release, in addition to the
real-world tests done by fellow beta-testers.

The manual testing process [[is documented on a dedicated
page|release_process/test]].

Tag the release in Git
======================

	git tag -u BE2CD9C1 -m "tagging version ${NEW_VERSION}" "${NEW_VERSION}"

Generate the Torrents
=====================

First, create a directory with a suitable name for every image to be
released, such as `tails-i386-0.7`.

Second, copy the built images to these brand new directories and
rename it to fit our `tails-ARCH-VERSION.iso` naming
convention e.g.:

	mv tails-i386-squeeze-0.7-20110303.iso \
	  tails-i386-0.7.iso

Third, generate detached GnuPG signatures for every published image,
in the same directory as the image and with a `.pgp` extension; e.g.

	gpg --armor --default-key BE2CD9C1 --detach-sign *.iso
	rename 's,\.asc$,.pgp,' *.asc

Fourth, create a `.torrent` file for every directory to be published:

	mktorrent -a \
	  'https://www.les-renseignements-genereux.org/tracker/announce' \
	  <DIRECTORY>

Fifth, check the generated `.torrent` files metainfo, e.g.
using `btshowmetainfo`, to make sure they don't contain
unwanted information.

Sixth, generate detached GnuPG signatures for every published
`.torrent` file:

	gpg --armor --default-key BE2CD9C1 --detach-sign \
	  tails-i386-0.7.torrent
	rename 's,\.asc$,.pgp,' *.asc

Upload images
=============

## Upload to HTTP mirrors

- upload the images and the `project/trace` file (updated with current
  epoch in it: `date +%s`) to the primary rsync mirror
- make sure every webserver listed in the `dl.amnesia.boum.org` round
  robin pool has the new version
- test downloading

## Announce, seed and test the Torrents

Announce and seed the Torrents using whatever box you can.
A decent, stable and permanent Internet connexion is required.

Test them with a BitTorrent client running in a different place.

Update the website and Git repository
=====================================

Rename the `.packages` file to remove the `.iso` part of its name.

Copy the `.iso.pgp`, `.packages`, `.torrent` and `.torrent.pgp`
files to the Git repository's `wiki/src/torrents/files/` directory.

Update the latest version and related information in `inc/*`.

Generate the SHA-256 hash of every image to be released in `inc/*`; e.g.

	sha256sum tails-i386-0.7.1.iso | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | tr -d '\n' \
	  > stable_i386_hash.html

Update `inc/trace`: put the same epoch as you previously put in
`project/trace`.

Update todo and bugs tags:

 - in `todo/*`: replace `pending` tags with `todo/done` tags
 - in `bugs/*`: replace links to `pending` with links to `done` (`[[todo/done]]`)

Update the [[doc/about/features]] page.

Write the announcement for the release in `news/version_X.Y.mdwn`. Use the
meta directive to set the post title to "Tails X.Y is out" so
that aggregators (such as Planet Debian Derivatives) display a more
catchy title.

Write an announcement listing the security bugs affecting the previous
version in `security/` in order to let the users of the old versions
know that they have to upgrade. This announcement page shall be dated back
to a few days before the one to be released was *built*.

Then add the updated `debian/changelog` and you should be ready to
record the last commit before tagging happens:

	git commit -m "releasing version ${NEW_VERSION}"

Go wild!
