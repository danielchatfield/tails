[[!meta title="Talking in public with other Tails developers and users"]]

<p>If you want to talk <strong>in public</strong> with other Tails developers and users:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      you may want to join our [[#tails-dev chatroom|contribute/chat]]; note: a rather small
      subset of Tails core developers hang out there, so asynchronous
      communication means are to be preferred for proposals,
      volunteering and anything else that might be of some interest
      for the whole Tails development community;
    </li>
    <li>
      the [[forum]] is open for discussions that <strong>do not</strong>
      belong to bugs, feature requests and the like;
    </li>
    <li>
      you can <a href='https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/tails-dev/'>subscribe</a> or write
      to the <a href='mailto:tails-dev@boum.org'>tails-dev@boum.org</a> mailing-list;
      any message sent to this
      list is stored in a public archive, so beware of what your email content
      and headers reveal about yourself: location, IP address, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      for <emph>translation-related matters</emph>, you can
      <a href='https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-l10n/'>subscribe</a> or write
      to the <a href='mailto:tails-l10n@boum.org'>tails-l10n@boum.org</a> mailing-list;
      any message sent to this
      list is stored in a public archive, so beware of what your email content
      and headers reveal about yourself: location, IP address, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For matters that need to be hidden from the public eyes, you can send email to
    the private development mailing list: <a href='mailto:tails@boum.org'>tails@boum.org</a>;
    encrypting such email with our [[OpenPGP key|doc/about/openpgp_keys]] is the only way to achieve end-to-end encryption.
