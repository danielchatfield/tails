Tails tasks are managed in a [[!tails_redmine "" desc="Redmine project"]].

If you need to do something in Redmine, but you appear to lack the
needed credentials, please ask <tails-sysadmins@boum.org> to give you
more power.

Some documentation about how we are using Redmine is available in the
[[contribute/working_together]] pages. See also the [[review and merge
process|contribute/merge_policy/review]] documentation.
