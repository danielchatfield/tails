# Create and update ticket

When a developer works on a task, she should create/update a ticket related to
the task. All the knowledge useful to the others should be kept there (or at
least linked from there). She should take care of updating the tags of the
ticket so that they reflect the actual status of the task and especially the
next thing to do for it to be solved.

The tickets are currently stored in this wiki in [[todo]]. We are in the process
of setting up a [[todo/better task manager]] (with ticket progress, assignments,
...).

# Report progress or failure

It is important for the team to know whether somebody is feeling responsible to
make a task happen, or that it's a wishlist/patches-welcome/don't-care-that-much
(would be great, but *We* don't feel committed to make it happen any time soon).

Thus, it is great to state if you'd like to do it, but also to state if you
won't do it anymore. Don't feel guilty: it's better if we all know it won't happen
soon rather than you feel presured while having other priorities!
