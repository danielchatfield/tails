[[!meta title="Release Manager"]]

# Tasks

* Around two weeks before the freeze, have a look at recent changes in
  the [Torbrowser](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git)'s
  prefs (e.g. `git log -p build-scripts/config/*.js`) and import the
  relevant ones to our Iceweasel configuration, following the normal
  review'n'merge process.
* Making the release happen: [[contribute/release_process]].
  - sending the release schedule on tails-dev when beginning their shift

# Shifts

The release manager shifts could be done by a team. They start right after the
publication of the previous release to the publication and announcement of the
release they are taking care of, which should be 6 weeks long if everything goes
fine.
