# Tasks

* When the new release manager's shift begins:

  - Send the release schedule on tails-dev when beginning their shift.
  - Ask to be added to the `rsync_tails` group on `rsync.lizard`,
    if needed.
  - Make sure you have access to the various systems used to do
    the release.

* Around two weeks before the freeze:

  - Have a look at recent changes in the
    [Torbrowser](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git)'s prefs
    (e.g. `git log -p build-scripts/config/*.js`) and import the
    relevant ones to our Iceweasel configuration, following the normal
    review'n'merge process. **Note**: for TBB 3.0 and beyond, the
    `tor-browser.git` patch that adds
    `browser/app/profile/000-tor-browser.js` will be the only place
    for these prefs, instead of config files in `torbrowser.git`
    (notice the additional *-*).
  - Around two weeks before the freeze, have a look at recent changes
    in [Torbutton](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbutton.git), and
    do whatever is needed to get the fixes we need in the release.

* Make the release happen: [[contribute/release_process]].

# Shifts

The release manager shifts could be done by a team. They start right after the
publication of the previous release to the publication and announcement of the
release they are taking care of, which should be 6 weeks long if everything goes
fine.
