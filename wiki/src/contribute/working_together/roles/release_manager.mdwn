# Tasks

Making the release happen: [[contribute/release_process]].

And on top of that:

* Go to the `todo/*` and `bugs/*` pages, and for every ticket:
  - sending the release schedule on tails-dev when beginning their shift
  - ensure the proper set of tags
    (and either update tags or ping whoever could/should do it)
  - ensure it is clearly stated what is the next
    thing to do, and that someone is feeling responsible to make it happen.
    (or it's a wishlist/patches-welcome/don't-care-that-much = would be great,
    but *We* don't feel commited to make it happen any time soon).
  - For "todo/qa" (quality assurance) make sure reviews and merges
    happen.
  - Add todo/easy tags where relevant.
  - For todo/wait and todo/upstream check if what was blocking was
    eventually resolved outside of Tails.

# Shifts

The release manager shifts could be done by a team. They start right after the
publication of the previous release to the publication and announcement of the
release they are taking care of, which should be 6 weeks long if everything goes
fine.
