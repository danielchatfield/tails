# Tasks

 * go through the [discussion
   tickets](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=114)
   and start discussions
 * if new [discussion
   tickets](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=114)
   were created, then make sure the discussion has been started
   publicly at least once
 * ensuring that nothing is forgotten (and thus everything gets
   into the tasks tracking system)
 * keeping an eye on unfinished discussions
 * asking people to state how they feel committed to complete something,
   if at all, and perhaps when.
   (by finishing a branch, leading discussion to conclusion, etc.)
 * asking people to merge their to-be-reviewed branch into experimental
 * asking people to update design doc accordingly to their code changes
 * announcing meeting time in advance (time keeper) making sure they are
   re-scheduled when they don't happen
 * making sure we implement, and apply daily, the task-handling-process 
   we decided
