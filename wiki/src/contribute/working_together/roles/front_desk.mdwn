# Tasks

  - Do user support by email:
    - Reply to bug reports received on tails-bugs@boum.org (empty report might
      be silently ignored).
    - Make sure everything is replied on tails-support@boum.org, while leaving
      space for other people to participate.
    - Reply random incoming emails on tails@boum.org.
  - Improve incrementally the FAQ based on the work done by email, and do
    whatever small tasks will make the frontdesk job's easier in the future.
  - Announce public meeting and low-hanging fruits session:
    * tails-dev@boum.org Twitter
    * [TWN](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorWeeklyNews)
      (follow the *Next steps* link)
  - Write report of low-hanging fruits session, and send it to tails-dev@ if
    attended.
  - Write & publish the minutes of the public meeting if attended.
  - Publish the monthly report.
  - Triage tickets created by non-developers:
    * if this is asking something we have already decided we will not
      do, close as rejected
    * if that's a duplicate, close as such set the correct status, category and
    * type of work set priority to Low if it's a feature request, unless we have
      decided we feel commited to implement it
    * if you feel it is important enough, but discussion is needed,
      then start the discussion to tails-dev@
  - Do user support on IRC if you feel like it.
