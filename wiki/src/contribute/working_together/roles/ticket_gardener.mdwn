[[!meta title="Ticket gardener"]]

Every three months, cron asks for a ticket gardener to go over all our
tickets.

# Tasks

* Go to the `todo/*` and `bugs/*` pages, and for every ticket:
  - ensure the proper set of tags
    (and either update tags or ping whoever could/should do it)
  - ensure it is clearly stated what is the next
    thing to do, and that someone is feeling responsible to make it happen.
    (or it's a wishlist/patches-welcome/don't-care-that-much = would be great,
    but *We* don't feel commited to make it happen any time soon).
  - For "todo/qa" (quality assurance) make sure reviews and merges
    happen.
  - Add todo/easy tags where relevant.
  - For todo/wait and todo/upstream check if what was blocking was
    eventually resolved outside of Tails.
