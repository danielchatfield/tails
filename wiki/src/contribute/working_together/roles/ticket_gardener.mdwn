[[!meta title="Ticket gardener"]]

Every three months, cron asks a ticket gardener to go over all our
tickets.

# Tasks

* Go to Redmine, and for each ticket:
  - Ensure that a correct set of tags is used
    (and either update tags or ping whoever should do it).
  - Ensure it is clearly stated what is the next
    thing to do, and that someone is feeling responsible to make it happen.
    Otherwise it's a wishlist/patches-welcome/don't-care-that-much/would be great,
    but *we* don't feel committed to make it happen any time soon.
  - For "QA Check" (quality assurance) make sure reviews and merges
    happen.
  - Add "easy" tags where relevant according to our [[criteria for easy
    tasks|criteria_for_easy_tasks]].
  - Add "low-hanging fruit" tags where relevant.
  - For "wait" and "upstream" type of work, check if what was blocking was
    eventually resolved outside of Tails.
