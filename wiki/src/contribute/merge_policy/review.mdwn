[[!meta title="Git merge policy: review and merge process"]]

## Review

- Check the diff e.g. with `git log -p`.
- Build the branch (or experimental) and test the feature.
- Check the user and design documentation.
- Check the ticket.

## Merge

On the Git side, merge the branch with `--no-ff` :

- for a new feature: into `devel`
- for a fix on top on the last RC: into `testing` and `devel`
- for a fix on top of the last stable: into `stable` and `devel`

On the APT repository side, [[merge the
suites|APT_repository#workflow-merge-topic-branch]].
