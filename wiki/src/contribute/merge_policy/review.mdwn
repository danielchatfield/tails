[[!meta title="Git merge policy: review and merge process"]]

## Review

- Build the branch (or experimental) and test the feature.
- Check the diff e.g. with `git log -p`.
- Check the APT suite with 
  `ssh reprepro@incoming.deb.tails.boum.org reprepro list [bugfix|feature]-<name-with-dashes>`
- Check the user and design documentation.
- Check the ticket.

## Merge

On the Git side, merge the branch with `--no-ff` :

- for a new feature: into `devel`
- for a fix on top on the last RC: into `testing` and `devel`
- for a fix on top of the last stable: into `stable` and `devel`

On the APT repository side,
[[merge the suites|APT_repository#workflow-merge-topic-branch]].

## Book keeping

1. Remove the `[[!tag todo/qa]]` from the ticket. If there is no remaining

   <version>`); else, ask the branch submitter to split the remaining tasks
   into other tickets.
1. Push your changes to Git.
1. Reply to the email that requested the review.
