## No unfinished stuff rotting for too long in the `devel` branch

A core developer who is commited to work on Tails on the long run may
carefully decide to merge work-in-progress code into the `devel`
branch, in order to get early feedback and testing results from
others.

When doing this, one commits to bring such "technology preview"
changes up to release quality in a timely manner. Unfinished code is
subject to reverting next time we decide to merge the `devel` branch
into the `testing` one and freeze it to prepare a release.

A development workflow based on topic-branches guarantees against such
hazards; moreover it helps linking together the various commits that
are part of a given patchset that can therefore be easily reviewed as
a whole, rather than as spread out individual commits.
