## Pull once in *good enough* state

Changes proposed by new contributors, or by the patch'n'forget kind,
shall respectively be applied once they are in *good enough* state.
That is, once the core developers team feels like maintaining it on
the long run in case the initial submitter disappears. Such
maintenance includes: polishing the proposed changes to make them fit
for release; writing and updating the design and end-user
documentations; fixing bugs.
