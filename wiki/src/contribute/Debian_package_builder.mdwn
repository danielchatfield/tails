# What?

debomatic.lizard runs the
[Deb-o-Matic](https://launchpad.net/debomatic) automatic build machine
for Debian source packages.

Packages are built for the i386 architecture.

Supported distributions are:

* `stable`
* `squeeze-backports`
* `unstable`

# How?

One has binary packages built by uploading a source package to
`/incoming/`, with dupload or dput, over scp.

The `Distribution:` field in the uploaded `.changes` file specifies
the distribution the source package must be built for.
The `changestool(1)` command, from [[!debpkg reprepro]], is very handy
to set this after building the source package locally, and before
uploading it to Deb-o-Matic.

Built packages can be copied from debomatic.lizard to apt.lizard
e.g. by using `scp -3` on the host.
