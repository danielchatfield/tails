# Iceweasel

* is web browsing really torified?
 - https://check.torproject.org/
 - http://monip.org/
* does the exposed User-Agent match the generic Torbutton's one?
  (connect to a website you can check the access logs for)
* firegpg: test symmetric encryption/decryption, same for asymmetric

# Pidgin

* pidgin: is an IRC session really torified?
 - if you are running an IRC server: check there
 - else: see if the connection to the IRC server appears in Vidalia
   connections list
* Check OTR is working.
* Check at least IRC and XMPP are working.

# Tor enforcement

* firewall: is the Tor-enforcement effective?
 - check output of `iptables -L -n`
 - check output of `iptables -t nat -L -n`
 - try connecting to the Internet using a piece of software that
   obeys neither `$http_proxy`, `$HTTP_PROXY` nor the GNOME proxy
   settings, *and* is not explicitely torified in T(A)ILS: **FIXME**
   which one?
* firewall: is IPv6 traffic blocked?
 - check output of `ip6tables -L -n`
 - at a place with working IPv6: try connecting to a known-working
   IPv6-enabled server on its IPv6 address over TCP and icmp6.
* is `resolv.conf` OK both before/after DHCP has been setup? it should
  *always* read `nameserver 127.0.0.1`

# Use of untrusted partitions

* are any local hard-disk partitions mounted or used as swap?
  boot on a (possibly virtual) machine that has a cleartext swap
  partition not managed by LVM. This swap partition must not be used
  by T(A)ILS.
* is a Live system found on a local hard-disk partition used? boot the
  CD/USB stick you are testing on a (possibly virtual) machine that
  has a T(A)ILS system copied on a cleartext partition not managed by
  LVM. The CD/USB ramdisk must use the T(A)ILS system found on the
  CD/USB, and not the one found on the hard disk.

# Claws

* Check mail over IMAP.
* Send an email.
* Check that the profile works and is torified (specifically the
  EHLO/HELO SMTP messages it sends). Send an email using Claws and a
  non-anonymizing SMTP relay. Then check that email's headers once
  received, especially the `Received:` and `Message-ID:` ones.

# Whisperback

* can a bug report e-mail be sent?
* is it correctly encrypted?

# GnuPG

* key search/receive: torified? going to the configured hkps://
  server?
 - `gpg --search` tells what server it is connecting to
 - the IP of the configured keyserver must appear in Vidalia's list
   of connections
 - if you run a keyserver, have a look there.

# Monkeysphere

* Monkeysphere validation agent key search/receive: torified?
  (the MSVA is simply not working currently, ignore this.)

# HTP

* disconnect the network cable, set the time to an obviously
  wrong one, connect the network cable => the date should be corrected
  and Tor/Vidalia should start correctly.

# Misc

* Check that all seems well during init (mostly that all services
  start without errors), and that dmesg seems ok.
* Boot without network connection, and then plug it in after
  some arbitrary time; Tor and Vidalia must be autostarted and end up
  in working state.
* Doing an apt-get update and installing random packages.
* Boot on bare-metal on USB and CD.
