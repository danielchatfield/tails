# Changes

Keeping an eye on the changes between released versions is one of the
many safeguards against releasing crap.

## Source

Thanks to Git tags one can easily compare the to-be-released source
code with previous version's one e.g.:

	git diff 0.6.1..stable

## Result

`wdiff -l` makes it easy to compare the list of bundled packages and
versions with the one shipped last time e.g.:

	wdiff -l wiki/src/torrents/files/tails-i386-lenny-0.6.1.packages \
	  tails-i386-lenny-0.7.packages | less

Check the output for:

- new packages that may cause harm or make the images unnecessarily
  big
- packages that could be erroneously removed
- new versions of software we might not have audited yet (including:
  does the combination of our configuration with software X version
  Y+1 achieve the same wished results as with software X version Y?)

# Iceweasel

* is web browsing really torified?
 - <https://check.torproject.org/>
 - <http://monip.org/>
* does the exposed User-Agent match the generic Torbutton's one?
  (connect to a website you can check the access logs for)
* firegpg: test symmetric encryption/decryption, same for asymmetric
* `about:plugins` should say no plugin is installed in every one of
  the following cases:
 1. Torbutton add-on enabled in *Tor enabled* status
 2. Torbutton add-on enabled in *Tor Disabled* status
 3. Torbutton add-on disabled

# Pidgin

* pidgin: is an IRC session really torified?
 - if you are running an IRC server: check there
 - else: see if the connection to the IRC server appears in Vidalia
   connections list
* Check OTR is working.
* Check at least IRC and XMPP are working.
* Check if pidgin doesn't leak to many informations on replying to different
  CTCP requests:
  * Start Tails and launch pidgin once done. Connect to an IRC server where you're already on
  * try to /ctcp <T(A)ILS_account_nick> COMMAND
  (for a list of commands, see [this page](http://www.wikkedwire.com/irccommands)).

# Tor enforcement

* firewall: is the Tor-enforcement effective?
 - check output of `iptables -L -n`
 - check output of `iptables -t nat -L -n`
 - try connecting to the Internet after unsetting `$http_proxy` and
   `$HTTP_PROXY` using a piece of software that does not obey the
   GNOME proxy settings, *and* is not explicitely torified in Tails:
   `unset http_proxy ; unset HTTP_PROXY ; wget http://monip.org`
* firewall: is IPv6 traffic blocked?
 - check output of `ip6tables -L -n`
 - at a place with working IPv6: try connecting to a known-working
   IPv6-enabled server on its IPv6 address over TCP and icmp6.
* is `resolv.conf` OK both before/after DHCP has been setup? it should
  *always* read `nameserver 127.0.0.1`

# Use of untrusted partitions

* are any local hard-disk partitions mounted or used as swap?
  boot on a (possibly virtual) machine that has a cleartext swap
  partition not managed by LVM. This swap partition must not be used
  by Tails.
* is a Live system found on a local hard-disk partition used? boot the
  CD/USB stick you are testing on a (possibly virtual) machine that
  has a Tails system copied on a cleartext partition not managed by
  LVM. The CD/USB ramdisk must use the Tails system found on the
  CD/USB, and not the one found on the hard disk.

# Claws

* Check mail over IMAP.
* Send an email.
* Check that the profile works and is torified (specifically the
  EHLO/HELO SMTP messages it sends). Send an email using Claws and a
  non-anonymizing SMTP relay. Then check that email's headers once
  received, especially the `Received:` and `Message-ID:` ones.
* Also check that the EHLO/HELO SMTP message is not leaking anything
  with a packet sniffer: Disable SSL/TLS for SMTP in Claws (so take
  precautions for not leaking your password in plaintext by either
  changing it temporarily or using a disposable account). Then run
  `sudo tcpdump -i lo -w dump` to capture the packets before Tor
  encrypts it, and check the dump for the HELO/EHLO message and
  verify that it only contains `localhost`.

# Whisperback

* can a bug report e-mail be sent?
* is it correctly encrypted?

# GnuPG

Those tests shall be run using GnuPG on the command-line, the
Seahorse GUI and FireGPG:

* key search/receive: torified? going to the configured keyserver?
 - `gpg --search` tells what server it is connecting to
 - the connection to the configured keyserver must appear in Vidalia's
   list of connections
 - if you run a keyserver, have a look there.

# Monkeysphere

* Monkeysphere validation agent key search/receive: torified? uses
  configured keyserver?

# Time



1. `sudo rm /var/lib/live/htp*`
   (FIXME-FOR-0.9: update for new tordate+htpdate setup: instead
   `rm /var/run/htpdate/success /var/run/tordate/done /var/lib/tor/cached-descriptors`
   )
2. disconnect the network cable
3. set the time to an obviously wrong one :

           date --set="Mon, 01 Mar 2000 15:45:34 - 0800"

4. connect the network cable

=> the date should be corrected and Tor/Vidalia should start
correctly.

# erase memory on shutdown

- check that `memlockd` and `udev-watchdog` are running, and that the right
  device is being watched by the later.
- remove Tails' media (USB and cdrom) and check that the memory
  erasure process is started (`Loading new kernel`, at least).

Testing that the needed files are really mapped in memory, and the
erasing process actually works, involves slightly more complicated
steps that are worth [[a dedicated page|test/erase_memory_on_shutdown]].

# Virtualization support

* `modinfo vboxguest` should work
* test in VirtualBox

# Misc

* Check that links to the online website (`Mirror:`) at the bottom of
  bundled static web pages are working. Else, it probably means the
  wiki was not built with the needed patched ikiwiki version.
* Check that all seems well during init (mostly that all services
  start without errors), and that dmesg seems ok.
* Boot without network connection, and then plug it in after
  some arbitrary time; Tor and Vidalia must be autostarted and end up
  in working state.
* Doing an apt-get update and installing random packages.
* Boot on bare-metal on USB and CD.
* Boot and check basic functionality is working for every supported
  language. The virtual keyboard must work and be auto-configured to
  use the same keyboard layout as the X session.
* Try to start with the `truecrypt` option on boot, see if it can be found in
  the Application -> Accessories menu and that it runs correctly
