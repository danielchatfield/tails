**FIXME** this process is quite complicated and should be automated using VMs

# 0. prepare the systems

## prepare a Tails USB stick

Install the Tails version to test on a 1st USB stick.

## prepare a minimal lenny live system 

We will use this system to do a coldboot attack. It is useful that it is a
minimal system so that it doesn't fill the RAM to boot.

To be able to grep /dev/mem, it must have a kernel with CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
disabled. It is enabled in debian since 2.6.28-1, so we use lenny:

    lb config  --architecture i386 --linux-flavours 686 --apt-recommends false --distribution lenny --binary-images usb-hdd --binary-indices false  --memtest none --packages-lists="minimal" --syslinux-menu vesamenu --initramfs=live-initramfs

Then install this image on a 2nd USB stick

# 1. fill the RAM with a known pattern

* boot on Tails
* add `fillram.py` which contains:

    string=""
    while True:
        string = string + "wipe_didnt_work/"

* launch it:

    $ python fillram.py

# 2. test that you can get the pattern

* plug the USB stick containing the minimal lenny live system
* reboot from Tails using SysRq + B
* under syslinux, append `init=/bin/bash` to the kernel commandline in order to
  run the test in the initramfs
* actually do the test:

    grep wipe_didnt_work /dev/mem

  - you should get `binary file /dev/mem matches` if the pattern was found in
    RAM, which is the expected result ;
  - you should get `grep: /dev/mem: Cannot allocate memory` otherwise. In that
    case, it is **not** useful to process to the next step, there is something
    wrong in the way you tested.

# 3. test that sdmem really hides the pattern

* redo step 1
* reboot from Tails the recommanded way : system > reboot
* plug the USB stick containing the minimal lenny live system
* when Tails displays that you can remove the USB stick, remove Tails and 
  plug the USB stick containing the minimal lenny live system
* under syslinux, append `init=/bin/bash` to the kernel commandline in order to
  run the test in the initramfs
* actually do the test:

    grep wipe_didnt_work /dev/mem

  - you should get `grep: /dev/mem: Cannot allocate memory` if the pattern was
    not found in RAM, which is the expected result;
  - you should get `binary file /dev/mem matches` if the pattern was found in
    RAM, which means that smem failed.
