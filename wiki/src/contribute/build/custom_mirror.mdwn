[[!meta title="Using a custom Debian mirror to build Tails images"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

# What?

You may want to use a Debian mirror different from the one
`live-build` uses by default.

# Why?

1. You want to use a mirror that is faster for you, e.g. one that is
   in the country you live in, or a local Debian mirror.
2. You have [[configured squid-deb-proxy|build/squid-deb-proxy]] to
   only allow access to a given set of domains.

# How?

You need to set options in live-build's configuration file
(`/etc/live/build.conf`), e.g.:

	LB_MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/"
	LB_MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP_SECURITY="http://security.debian.org/"

	LB_MIRROR_CHROOT="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/"
	LB_MIRROR_CHROOT_SECURITY="http://security.debian.org/"

	LB_MIRROR_BINARY="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/"
	LB_MIRROR_BINARY_SECURITY="http://security.debian.org/"

See the `lb_config(1)` manpage for details.
