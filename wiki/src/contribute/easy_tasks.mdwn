design, writing, coding, etc.

[Easy tasks ordered by type of work](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=112)

The description of the task should provide enough useful information to help you
complete it. Otherwise, don't hesitate to [[ask us|contribute/talk]] for
clarification.

You can also have a look at other tasks marked as [low
priority](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=131) in
our bug tracker. We marked them as of low priority according to our
[roadmap]((https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap) but they might
be interesting, useful and fun to work on!

Recommendations
===============

  - Once you choose a task that fits your skills, send an email to
    [[tails-dev@boum.org|contribute/talk]] saying that you are starting to work
    on this task.

  - Keep us updated with your progress from time to time.

  - Even if you are deeply skilled, please consider doing one little easy hack,
    to get used to the process. After that, you are invited to move on up to
    more difficult tasks, leaving some of the easy tasks to others so they can
    get involved and achieve change themselves.
