	<p>It is important to check the <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia
	Data_integrity desc="integrity"]]</span> of the ISO image you downloaded
	to make sure that the download went well.</p>

	<p><strong>Warning: the following techniques don't provide you with a
	strong way of checking the ISO image <span
	class="definition">[[!wikipedia Authentication
	desc="authenticity"]]</span> and making sure you downloaded a genuine
	Tails.</strong> We will propose you after that some more advanced
	techniques to <a href="#authenticity-check">check the authenticity of
	the ISO image</a>.</p>

	<p>Those techniques rely on standard HTTPS and <span
	class="definition">[[!wikipedia Certificate_authority desc="certificate
	authorities"]]</span> to make you trust the content of this website.
	But, [[as explained on our warning
	page|doc/about/warning#man-in-the-middle]], you
	could still be victim of a man-in-the-middle attack while using HTTPS.
	On this website as much as on any other of the Internet.</p>

	<p><strong>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our
	OpenPGP key.</strong>
	OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic
	privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.
	Checking this signature is the recommended way of checking the ISO image
	integrity.</p>

	<p>If you already know how to use an OpenPGP key you can download it
	straight away:</p>

	[[!inline pages="lib/download_tails_signing_key" raw="yes"]]

	<p>Otherwise, read our instructions to check the ISO image integrity:</p>

	<h2><a name="authenticity-check"></a>So how can I check better the ISO

	<p>But the Tails signing key that you downloaded from this website could

	<p>Finding a way of trusting better Tails signing key would allow you to

	<h1 class="bullet-number-four">Burn a DVD or install onto a USB stick</h1>

	<h2>Burning a DVD</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>DVDs are read-only so your Tails can't be altered by a virus or an
	  attacker.</li>
	  <li>DVDs are cheap but you will need to burn a new DVD each time you
	  will update your version of Tails.</li>
	  <li>You could also use a DVD-RW but those are not read-only.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For detailed instructions on how to burn an ISO image under Linux,
	Windows or Mac OSÂ X you can consult <a
	href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto">the
	corresponding Ubuntu documentation</a>: just replace the Ubuntu ISO
	image by the Tails ISO image you downloaded and ignore the part on
	verifying the data integrity since you've already done that.</p>

	<h2>Installing onto a USB stick</h2>

	<p><strong>The content of the USB stick will be lost in the
	operation.</strong></p>

	<ul>
	  <li>An attacker with physical access to your USB stick or through a
	  virus could alter your Tails.</li>
	  <li>USB sticks can be reused across different versions of Tails.</li>
	  <li>You can store documents in the space left on the USB stick and
	  use persistence.</li>
	  <li>USB sticks are smaller to fit in your pocket.</li>
	  <li>Older computers might not be able to start from a USB stick.</li>
	  <li>This technique also works for <span
	  class="definition">[[!wikipedia SD_card desc="SD cards"]]</span>. Some
	  SD cards have a read-only switch that can prevent your Tails from
	  being altered.</li>

	<p>
	<strong>It's very important to keep your version of Tails up-to-date, otherwise
	your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes.</strong> The
	development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known
	security holes on a regular basis.
	</p>

	<p>New versions are announced on:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>our <a href='https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/amnesia-news'>news
	mailing-list</a></li>
	<li>our <a href='/torrents/rss/index.rss'>RSS</a> and <a
	href='/torrents/rss/index.atom'>Atom</a> feeds that announces new
	available BitTorrent files.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Refer to our [[security announcements|/security]] feed for more
	detailed information about the security holes affecting Tails.
	Furthermore you will be automatically notified of the security holes
	affecting the version you are using at the startup of a new Tails
	session.</p>

	<p>Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantages of the all of the
	work done by the Debian security team. As quoted from <a
	href="http://security.debian.org/">(http://security.debian.org/)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all
	security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are
	corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated
	with other free software vendors and are published the same day a
	vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that
	reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
	not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions
	to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status
	with respect to various known security holes, which could potentially
	affect Debian.</blockquote>

	<h1 class="bullet-number-six">Start Tails!</h1>

	<p>Now that you have a Tails DVD or USB stick you can shutdown your
	computer and start using Tails without altering your existing operating
	system.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a DVD:</strong> Put the Tails DVD into the
	CD/DVD-drive and restart the computer. You should see a welcome screen
	prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If you don't get this menu, you can consult the Ubuntu documentation
	about <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">booting
	from the CD</a> for more information, especially the part on the <a
	href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD#BIOS%20is%20not%20set%20to%20boot%20from%20CD%20or%20DVD%20drive">
	BIOS settings</a>.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a USB stick:</strong> Shutdown the computer,
	plug your USB stick and start the computer. You should see a welcome
	screen prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit
	the BIOS settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message
	telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually
	be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is
	booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order.
	Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive'
	or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer
	to attempt to boot from USB before booting from the hard disk. Save your
	changes and continue.</p>
