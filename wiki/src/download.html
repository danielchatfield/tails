	<h1 class="bullet-number-three">Verify the ISO image</h1>

	<p>It is important to check the <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia
	Data_integrity desc="integrity"]]</span> of the ISO image you downloaded
	to make sure that the download went well.</p>

	<p><strong>Warning: the following techniques don't provide you with a

	<p>Those techniques rely on standard HTTPS and <span

	But, [[as explained on our warning page|doc/warning#index3h1]], you
	could still be victim of a man-in-the-middle attack while using HTTPS.
	On this website as much as on any other of the Internet.</p>

	<p>It is anyway a good thing to check the ISO image integrity first. We
	will propose you after that some more advanced techniques to <a
	href="#authenticity-check">check the authenticity of the ISO
	image</a>.</p>

	<p>All Tails ISO image are cryptographically signed by our OpenPGP key.
	OpenPGP is a standard for data encryption that provides cryptographic
	privacy and authentication through the use of keys owned by its users.
	Checking this signature is the recommended way of checking the ISO image
	integrity.</p>

	<h2>Using Linux with Gnome: Ubuntu, Debian, Tails, Fedora, etc.</h2>

	<p>You need to have the <code>seahorse-plugins</code> package
	installed. If you're not sure or want to install it, under Debian,
	Ubuntu or Tails you can issue the following commands:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install seahorse-plugins
</pre>

	<p>First, download Tails signing key:</p>

	[[!inline pages="lib/download_tails_signing_key" raw="yes"]]

	<p>Your browser should propose you to open it with "Import Key". Choose
	this action. It will add Tails signing key to your keyring, the
	collection of OpenPGP keys you already imported:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/import_key.png alt="What should Iceweasel do with
	this file? Open with: Import Key (default)" link="no"]]</p>

	<p>You will get notified will the following message:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/key_imported.png alt="Key Imported. Imported a key
	for Tails developers (signing key) &lt;tails@boum.org&gt;"
	link="no"]]</p>

	<p>Now, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the ISO
	image you want to verify:</p>

	[[!inline pages="lib/download_stable_i386_iso_sig" raw="yes"]]

	<p>Your browser should propose you to open it with "Verify Signature".
	Choose this action to start the cryptographic verification:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/verify_signature.png alt="What should Iceweasel do
	with this file? Open with: Verify Signature (default)" link="no"]]</p>

	<p>Browse your files to select the Tails ISO image you want to verify.
	Then, the verification will start. It can take several minutes:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/verifying.png alt="Verifying" link="no"]]</p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is correct</strong> you will get a
	notification telling you that the signature is good:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/good_signature.png alt="Goog Signature"
	link="no"]]</p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is not correct</strong> you will get a
	notification telling you that the signature is bad:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/bad_signature.png alt="Bad Signature: Bad or forged
	signature." link="no"]]</p>

	[[!toggleable id="verify_the_iso_image_using_the_command_line" text="""
	<span class="hide">[[!toggle id="verify_the_iso_image_using_the_command_line"
	text="Hide"]]</span>

	<h2>Using Linux with the command line</h2>

	<p>You need to have GnuPG installed. GnuPG is the common OpenPGP
	implementation for Linux: it is installed by default under Debian,
	Ubuntu, Tails and many other distributions.</p>

	<p>First, download Tails signing key:</p>

	[[!inline pages="lib/download_tails_signing_key" raw="yes"]]

	<p>Open a terminal and import Tails signing key with the following
	commands:</p>

<pre>
cd [the directory in which you downloaded the key]
cat tails-signing.key | gpg --import
</pre>

	<p>The output should tell you that the key was imported:</p>

<pre>
gpg: key BE2CD9C1: public key "Tails developers (signing key) &lt;tails@boum.org&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:               imported: 2  (RSA: 2)
</pre>

	<p>If you had already imported Tails signing key in the past, the output
	should tell you that the key was not changed:</p>

<pre>
gpg: key BE2CD9C1: "Tails developers (signing key) &lt;tails@boum.org&gt;" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 2
gpg:              unchanged: 2
</pre>

	<p>Now, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the ISO
	image you want to verify and save it in the same folder as the ISO
	image:</p>

	[[!inline pages="lib/download_stable_i386_iso_sig" raw="yes"]]

	<p>Then start the cryptographic verification, it can take several
	minutes:</p>

<pre>
cd [the ISO image directory]
gpg --verify tails-i386-0.8.1.iso.pgp tails-i386-0.8.1.iso
</pre>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is correct</strong> the output will tell you
	that the signature is good:</p>

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Sat 30 Apr 2011 10:53:23 AM CEST
gpg:                using RSA key 1202821CBE2CD9C1
gpg: Good signature from "Tails developers (signing key) &lt;tails@boum.org&gt;"
</pre>

	<p>This might be followed by a warning saying:</p>

<pre>
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 0D24 B36A A9A2 A651 7878  7645 1202 821C BE2C D9C1
</pre>

	<p>This doesn't alter the validity of the signature according to the key
	you downloaded. This warning rather has to do with the trust that you
	put in Tails signing key. See, [[Trusting Tails signing
	key|doc/trusting_tails_signing_key]]. To remove this warning you would
	have to personnally <span class="definition">[[!wikipedia Keysigning
	desc="sign"]]</span> Tails signing key with your own key.</p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is not correct</strong> the output will tell
	you that the signature is bad:</p>

<pre>
gpg: Signature made Sat 30 Apr 2011 10:53:23 AM CEST
gpg:                using RSA key 1202821CBE2CD9C1
gpg: BAD signature from "Tails developers (signing key) &lt;tails@boum.org&gt;"

	<h2>Using other operating systems</h2>

	<h3>Using Firefox</h3>

	<p>This technique is not using the cryptographic signature as the others
	do. We propose it because it's especially easy for Windows users.</p>

	<p>Install the CheckIt extension for Firefox available <a
	href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/checkit/">here</a>
	and restart Firefox.</p>

	<p>Here is the checksum (a kind of digital fingerprint) of the ISO
	image. Select it with your cursor:</p>

	<pre>[[!inline pages="inc/stable_i386_hash" raw="yes"]]</pre>

	<p>Right-click on it and choose "Selected hash (SHA256)" from the
	contextual menu:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/selected_hash.png alt="Selected hash (SHA256)"
	link="no"]]</p>

	<p>From the dialog box that shows up, open the ISO image. Then wait for
	the checksum to compute. This will take several seconds during which
	your browser will be unresponsive.</p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is correct</strong> you will get a
	notification saying that the checksums match:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/checksums_match.png alt="CheckIt: SHA256 checksums
	match!" link="no"]]</p>

	<p><strong>If the ISO image is not correct</strong> you will get a
	notification telling you that the checksums do not match:</p>

	<p>[[!img download/checksums_do_not_match.png alt="SHA256 checksums do
	not match!" link="no"]]</p>

	<h3>Using the cryptographic signature</h3>

	<p>GnuPG, a common free software implementation of OpenPGP has versions
	and graphical frontends for both Windows and Mac OS X. This also make it
	possible to check the cryptographic signature with those operating
	systems:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>[[Gpg4win|http://www.gpg4win.org/]], for Windows</li>
	  <li>[[GPGTools|http://www.gpgtools.org/]], for Mac OS X</li>
	</ul>

	<p>You will find on either of those websites detailed documentation on
	how to install and use them.</p>

	<h3>For Windows using Gpg4win</h3>

	<p>After installing Gpg4win, download Tails signing key:</p>

	[[!inline pages="lib/download_tails_signing_key" raw="yes"]]

	<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to import
	it|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_15.html]]</p>

	<p>Then, download the cryptographic signature corresponding to the ISO
	image you want to verify:</p>

	[[!inline pages="lib/download_stable_i386_iso_sig" raw="yes"]]

	<p>[[Consult the Gpg4win documentation to check the
	signature|http://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium_24.html#id4]]</p>

	<h3>For Mac OS X using GPGTools</h3>

	<p>After installing GPGTools, you should be able to follow the
	instruction for Linux with the command line. To open the command line,
	navigate to your Applications folder, open Utilities, and double click
	on Terminal.</p> """]]

	<h1 class="bullet-number-four">Burn a CD or install onto a USB stick</h1>

	<p>Every ISO image we ship can be either burn on a CD or installed onto a USB stick.</p>

	<h2>Burning a CD</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>CDs are read-only so your Tails can't be altered by a virus or an
	  attacker.</li>
	  <li>CDs are cheap but you will need to burn a new CD each time you
	  will update your Tails version (hint: CD-RW).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For detailed instructions on how to burn an ISO image under Linux,
	Windows or Mac OS X you can consult <a

	image by the Tails ISO image you downloaded and ignore the part on
	verifying the data integrity since you've already done that.</p>

	<h2>Installing onto a USB stick</h2>

	<p><strong>The content of the USB stick will be lost in the

	<ul>
	  <li>An attacker with physical access to your USB stick or through a

	<strong>It's very important to keep your Tails version up-to-date, otherwise
	your system will be vulnerable to numerous security holes.</strong> The
	development team is doing its best to release new versions fixing known
	security holes on a regular basis.
	</p>

	<p>New versions are announced on:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>our <a href='https://boum.org/mailman/listinfo/amnesia-news'>news
	mailing-list</a></li>
	<li>our <a href='torrents/rss/index.rss'>RSS</a> and <a
	href='/torrents/rss/index.atom'>Atom</a> feeds that announces new
	available BitTorrent files.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Refer to our [[security announcements|/security]] feed for more
	detailed information about the security holes affecting Tails.
	Furthermore you will be automatically notified of the security holes
	affecting the version you are using at the startup of a new Tails
	session.</p>

	<p>Since Tails is based on Debian, it takes advantages of the all of the
	work done by the Debian security team. As quoted from <a
	href="http://security.debian.org/">(http://security.debian.org/)</a>:</p>

	<blockquote>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all
	security problems brought to our attention and ensure that they are
	corrected within a reasonable timeframe. Many advisories are coordinated
	with other free software vendors and are published the same day a
	vulnerability is made public and we also have a Security Audit team that
	reviews the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.
	</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does
	not work. Public disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions
	to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses Debian's status
	with respect to various known security holes, which could potentially
	affect Debian.</blockquote>

	<h1 class="bullet-number-six">Start Tails!</h1>

	<p>Now that you have a Tails CD or USB stick you can shutdown your
	computer and start using Tails without altering your existing operating
	system.</p>

	<p><strong>If you're using a CD:</strong> Put the Tails CD into the
	CD/DVD-drive and restart the computer. You should see a welcome screen
	prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If you don't get this menu, you can consult the Ubuntu documentation
	about <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">booting

	<p><strong>If you're using a USB stick:</strong> Shutdown the computer,
	plug in your USB stick and start the computer. You should see a welcome
	screen prompting you to choose your language.</p>

	<p>If your computer does not automatically do so, you might need to edit
	the BIOS settings. Restart your computer, and watch for a message
	telling you which key to press to enter the BIOS setup. It will usually
	be one of F1, F2, DEL, ESC or F10. Press this key while your computer is
	booting to edit your BIOS settings. You need to edit the Boot Order.
	Depending on your computer you should see an entry for 'removable drive'
	or 'USB media'. Move this to the top of the list to force the computer
