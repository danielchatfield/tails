*The Amnesic Incognito Live System* ([Live
CD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD), [Live
USB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_USB)) is aimed at preserving

computers independently of Microsoft Windows or whatever installed
operating system.

Particularly, The Amnesic Incognito Live System guarantees you that:

* All outgoing connections to the Internet are forced to go through the
  [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) network.
* No trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.

Additional features
===================

To prevent cold-boot attacks and various memory forensics, Tails
erases memory on shutdown and when the boot media is physically
removed.

Tails has opt-in I2P support.

Multilingual support
====================

One can choose at boot time between the following languages:
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Italian, German, Portuguese
and Spanish (Castellano).

Some of these languages could not be thoroughly tested as we don't
speak every language in the world. If you find issues using one of the
supposedly supported languages, don't hesitate to [[tell us about
it|found_a_problem]]. E.g. Tails probably lacks some non-Latin fonts
or input systems.

If you wish to make it easier to use Tails for your language speakers,
see the [[translators guidelines|contribute/how/translate]].
