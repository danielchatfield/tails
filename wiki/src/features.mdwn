Multilingual support
====================

One can choose at boot time between the following languages:
Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Italian, German, Portuguese,
Russian and Spanish (Castellano).

Some of these languages could not be thoroughly tested as we don't
speak every language in the world. If you find issues using one of the
supposedly supported languages, don't hesitate to [[tell us about
it|found_a_problem]]. E.g. T(A)ILS probably lacks some non-Latin fonts
or input systems.
