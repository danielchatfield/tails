How to [[build]] a custom system based on The (Amnesic) Incognito
Live System?

[[!toc levels=2]]

# settings specific to The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System

The settings that can be customized can be found in `config/amnesia`;
e.g. desktop environment.

You'd better never directly edit this file: rather put your custom
variable assignments in a new `config/amnesia.local` file. The values
found in the `.local` file will override the ones from the
upstream one.

These configuration files are actually shell scripts, and are sourced
by various other scripts.

# Debian Live settings

The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System is based on Debian Live.
Nearly everything can thus be customized. To learn how to do so, refer
to the Debian Live [manual](http://live.debian.net/manual/),
[website](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/) and
[wiki](http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive/).

# $HOME

One may want to build an image including a modified version of the
live user's `$HOME` directory. There are multiple ways to do so:

1. editing and creating files in `config/chroot_local-includes/home/amnesia/`
2. dropping shell scripts in `config/chroot_local-hooks/` or
   `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/live-bottom/`
   to modify `/home/amnesia` in a program-driven way
   (`gconftool`, etc.)
3. eventually, one may run the live system, do the desired
   modifications, save the resulting `/home/amnesia` directory, then
   use the `home-refresh` script to import the modifications into the
   directory used to build images from, i.e.
   `config/chroot_local-includes/home/amnesia`. Read the (scarse)
   documentation at the top of this script for usage information.
