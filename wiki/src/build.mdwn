[[!meta title="Building a Tails image"]]

[[!toc levels=2]]

One may want to [[customize]] her image before building.

Every following command must be run as `root`, at the root of the
source directory one has [[downloaded|Git]].

For the impatient ones:

	$ git clone git://git.immerda.ch/amnesia.git
	$ cd amnesia
	$ sudo su
	# lb config && lb build

Dependencies
============

* `live-build` 2.0.3; Tails code is usually tested against Squeeze's
  live-build, but a sid or a snapshot from the Debian Live repository
  can sometimes be needed during a development cycle.
* `syslinux` >= 4.01, so that the built ISO images are
  converted to hybrid ones: they can be either a CD-ROM or a hard disk
  (USB disk, etc.).
* `eatmydata` (e.g. from Debian sid), `time` and `whois` (for /usr/bin/mkpasswd) packages.
* Released images are built using a patched ikiwiki is needed so that
  the static version of the wiki included in the image has correct
  links to the online wiki; see this [wishlist
  item](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/mirrorlist_with_per-mirror_usedirs_settings/)
  to get the custom ikiwiki branch. It is not critical to do use it
  but at release time.
* You also want to install `po4a` and `perlmagick` so that ikiwiki
  will build smoothly in all languages, and include the needed images.

Build process
=============

## Customize the build process if needed

If you need to set custom build settings that are specific to your
local environment, such as a custom Debian mirror or APT proxy, you
probably want to configure live-build a bit.

The most common customizations are documented on this wiki:

* [[using a custom Debian mirror to build Tails
  images|build/custom_mirror]];
* [[using squid-deb-proxy to build Tails images|build/squid-deb-proxy]].

More documentation about this can be found in the [Debian Live
Manual](http://live.debian.net/manual/en/).

## Initialize the Live system's configuration

Initialize the Live system's configuration with `lb config` in a
**clean** build tree. Most `lb config` options are supported, have a
look to the `lb_config(1)` manpage for details.

## Build the system

You can then use the standard live-build commands as root to build
the image (`lb build`) and to cleanup the build directory (`lb
clean`).

## More information

More documentation about the build process can be found in the [Debian
Live Manual](http://live.debian.net/manual/en/).
