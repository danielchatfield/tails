"Running Tails from a CD has its virtues but it can certainly also have its "
"limitations. While CDs are portable they generally do not fit in your "
"pocket. A USB stick certainly fits any pocket or your key ring.  In "
"addition, CDs are read-only and thus no data can be saved to them, but that "
"is, again, not the case with USB sticks. However, storing sensitive data on "
"writeable media could be dangerous if it got into the wrong hands. "
"Similarly, if we get a virus, or manage to damage the system in other ways, "
"the system is tainted or unusable from that point and all consecutive boots, "
"either with or without your knowledge. Clearly that is not good."

"Note that the method of installing Tails onto a USB stick is pretty crude at "
"the moment (a more intuituve way is planned). If you do not know precisely "
"what the things mentioned below mean it is recommended to stop now as you "
"otherwise might risk overwriting any present hard drives. Proceed at your "
"own discretion!"

"There is also a third path that would be worth mentioning: most SD cards "
"have a read-only switch. It might cost a little bit more, but not much, to "
"buy an USB SD card reader and a SD card with such switch. That way, you can "
"keep your Tails system read-only when you are not upgrading it, something "
"closer to a CD-RW than a plain USB stick."
