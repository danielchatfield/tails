"Some other important things that need to be understood before proceeding are "
"the concepts of [LiveDistro, LiveCD and LiveUSB](http://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/Livedistro). In essence a LiveDistro is an operating system (like "
"Windows or Mac OS X, although T(A)ILS uses Linux) that is run from some "
"removable media like a CD or USB drive. Most likely you are running T(A)ILS "
"from a CD, which makes it into a LiveCD, and this brings some limitations to "
"its operation.  Most importantly, since the CD is a read-only medium once it "
"has been burned by your CD recording software no changes persist through "
"reboots. So, if you download a file or make some application settings they "
"will be gone once you shut-down. This is both good and bad – on the plus "
"side, if you screw up anything or get a virus, the system will be restored "
"once you have restarted it. But not being able to save stuff is of course "
"inconvenient in some cases. If you find it frustrating you might want to run "
"T(A)ILS from a USB drive instead, making it into a LiveUSB. Since a USB "

"RAM is usually considered to be extremely volatile, meaning that the data "
"itstores starts to disintegrate rapidly once power is removed.  However, it "
"has been shown that the data might be recoverable for seconds or even "
"minutes after this happens, and apparently freeze spray can be used to "
"increase that period significantly. Once the power is restored the RAM state "
"will keep getting refreshed, so if the power supply is portable the removed "
"RAM modules' contents are in the hands of the attacker. Alternatively the "
"computer can simply be reset (i.e. switched off and back on quickly), which "
"barely even affects the power. Then a tiny LiveCD system is loaded with the "
"ability to dump the RAM to some writeable media. In both cases the RAM "
"contents can be analysed in a computer forensics laboratory which might turn "
"into a major disaster depending on what they find."

"Certain users might not want to restart the computer every time they wish to "

"(A)ILS inside the \"host\" operating system installed on the computer (e.g. "

"ILS) in so they appear in a window within the host operating system. Using "

"Also, please try to follow the instructions given by security tools as much "

"improvise solutions, but you should really try to learn when that is "
"appropriate before you do it. For instance, when using PGP encryption you "
"are often asked to verify the authenticity of any new public key that you "
"have just got. If you do not do this it is possible that you are using a "
"compromised key sent by an attacker performing a [man-in-the-middle attack]"
"(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack).  Usually the "
"authentication works by presenting you with the key's so called fingerprint, "
"which is a unique identifier for that key that cannot be faked. Verification "
"should then be done by asking you friend to send you the fingerprint through "
"some safe channel, which could be anything from telling it by telephone or "
"VoiP (which is hard for an attacker to manipulate on the fly) or even face-"
"to-face (but hen you can exchange the actual keys securely instead), and "
"then making sure that they are the same. Assuming the channel is safe the "
"fingerprint sent by your friend and the one you get from the key should be "
"identical, otherwise something is wrong."

"The above authentication methods are of course not always possible, but here "
"is one of those places you can be creative. For example, you could send the "
"fingerprint hidden in an innocent looking image by some means, although this "
"is admittedly not bulletproof. You could make this method a bit safer by "
"first sending the picture to your unknowing recipient and telling him or her "
"how the fingerprint is hidden when you know that it has been received. "
"Additionally, these kinds of tricky exchanges are always better to make over "
"interactive communication channels such as IRC or with instant messaging "
"since that will decrease the window of opportunity for any eavesdropper to "
"interfere. Email is not very suitable as delays are long which gives the "
"attacker ample time to act. An alternative authentication method to "
"fingerprints, used by OTR, is to simply ask both parties of a shared secret "
"that both should know. In this case, do not choose just anything – if "
"someone is watching you they probably know which high school you went to, "
"the size of your shoes and similar facts."
