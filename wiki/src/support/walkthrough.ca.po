"By relaying your Internet traffic through the Tor network (which Tails does "

"untraceable back to the computer you use, not encrypted or in any other way "
"unreadable by others. While the traffic _is_ encrypted when it leaves your "
"computer and when you get back your responses, it will not necessarily be so "
"when sent between the Tor network and your destination (this is unavoidable "
"for technical reasons). This means that an eavesdropper at some later point "
"will be able see your traffic without Tor's encryption unless you take "
"further precautions (described [later on](#ff)), but will not be able to "

"As such, if you are sending or receiving sensitive data whose disclosure "

"Some other important things that need to be understood before proceeding are "
"the concepts of [LiveDistro, LiveCD and LiveUSB](http://en.wikipedia.org/"
"wiki/Livedistro). In essence a LiveDistro is an operating system (like "
"Windows or Mac OS X, although Tails uses Linux) that is run from some "
"removable media like a CD or USB drive. Most likely you are running Tails "
"from a CD, which makes it into a LiveCD, and this brings some limitations to "
"its operation.  Most importantly, since the CD is a read-only medium once it "
"has been burned by your CD recording software no changes persist through "
"reboots. So, if you download a file or make some application settings they "
"will be gone once you shut-down. This is both good and bad – on the plus "
"side, if you screw up anything or get a virus, the system will be restored "
"once you have restarted it. But not being able to save stuff is of course "
"inconvenient in some cases. If you find it frustrating you might want to run "
"Tails from a USB drive instead, making it into a LiveUSB. Since a USB drive "
"is writeable medium it is possible to make it so that the changes persist "
"through reboots. You can read more about this and its implications [later]"

"have just got. If you do not do this it is possible that you are using a "
"compromised key sent by an attacker performing a [man-in-the-middle attack]"
"(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack).  Usually the "
"authentication works by presenting you with the key's so called fingerprint, "
"which is a unique identifier for that key that cannot be faked. Verification "
"should then be done by asking you friend to send you the fingerprint through "
"some safe channel, which could be anything from telling it by telephone or "
"VoiP (which is hard for an attacker to manipulate on the fly) or even face-"
"to-face (but hen you can exchange the actual keys securely instead), and "
"then making sure that they are the same. Assuming the channel is safe the "
"fingerprint sent by your friend and the one you get from the key should be "
"identical, otherwise something is wrong."

"The above authentication methods are of course not always possible, but here "
"is one of those places you can be creative. For example, you could send the "
"fingerprint hidden in an innocent looking image by some means, although this "
"is admittedly not bulletproof. You could make this method a bit safer by "
"first sending the picture to your unknowing recipient and telling him or her "
"how the fingerprint is hidden when you know that it has been received. "
"Additionally, these kinds of tricky exchanges are always better to make over "
"interactive communication channels such as IRC or with instant messaging "
"since that will decrease the window of opportunity for any eavesdropper to "
"interfere. Email is not very suitable as delays are long which gives the "
"attacker ample time to act. An alternative authentication method to "
"fingerprints, used by OTR, is to simply ask both parties of a shared secret "
"that both should know. In this case, do not choose just anything – if "
"someone is watching you they probably know which high school you went to, "
"the size of your shoes and similar facts."
