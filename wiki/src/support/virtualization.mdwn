FIXME: shouldn't the paragraph "T(A)ILS and Virtualization" from [[walkthrough]]
come here?

Security issues
===============

When running T(A)ILS inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system
and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in
T(A)ILS. Moreover traces are likely to be left on the local hard disk.

That's why T(A)ILS warns you when you are running it inside a virtual
machine.

If you read this warning while you are not aware to be using a virtual
machine:  there could be a [[bug|found_a_problem]] in the
virtualization detection software T(A)ILS uses... or something really
weird is happening.
