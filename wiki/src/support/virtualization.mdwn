FIXME: shouldn't the paragraph "Tails and Virtualization" from [[walkthrough]]
come here?

Security issues
===============

When running Tails inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system
and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in
Tails. Moreover traces are likely to be left on the local hard disk.

That's why Tails warns you when you are running it inside a virtual
machine. Do not expect Tails to protect you if you run it in a virtual
machine if you do not trust the host computer, Tails is not magical!

If you read this warning while you are not aware to be using a virtual
machine:  there could be a [[bug|found_a_problem]] in the
virtualization detection software Tails uses... or something really
weird is happening.

If you are unsure, and if you can afford it, just run Tails from a CD
or USB stick.

Tips and tricks
===============

The [[main Tails documentation|support/walkthrough]] has a chapter on
virtualization.

Some [[support/virtualization/tips]] can help making the host
operating system and virtualization software a tiny bit more secure.
