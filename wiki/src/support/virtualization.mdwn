FIXME: shouldn't the paragraph "Tails and Virtualization" from [[walkthrough]]
come here?

Security issues
===============

When running Tails inside a virtual machine, both the host operating system
and the virtualization software are able to monitor what you are doing in
Tails. Moreover traces are likely to be left on the local hard disk.

That's why Tails warns you when you are running it inside a virtual
machine.

If you read this warning while you are not aware to be using a virtual
machine:  there could be a [[bug|found_a_problem]] in the
virtualization detection software Tails uses... or something really
weird is happening.
