[[!meta title="Known issues"]]

Some machines have been reported to have problems starting Tails.

This list might not be accurate nor complete.

[[!toc]]

Tails may not erase all the system memory on shutdown
-----------------------------------------------------

On rare systems (non-PAE with big amounts of memory),
Tails does not consistently [[erase all system memory as it
should|bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]].

Connecting to FTP servers is not possible
-----------------------------------------

Public FTP servers on the Internet are not reachable using Tails.
See [[the corresponding task|todo/fix_Internet_FTP_support]] for more details.

YouTube video are hard to get
-----------------------------

[[HTML5 video are not easily seen on YouTube|todo/easier_YouTube]]. When the
message *This video is currently unavailable* appears, the video can actually be viewed.
Right-click on the page, select **NoScript** → **Blocked objects** and
**Temporarily allow…** the video.

Tails will never support videos which requires Flash (those with ads).

Apple hardware
--------------

For the moment, Tails has a very limited support for Apple hardware.

Most recent Apple hardware does not boot without UEFI, and currently
Tails does not start with UEFI. See the corresponding
[[ticket|/todo/UEFI]].

Dell Inc. Latitude E6430/0CPWYR
-------------------------------

Do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB Installer.

With BIOS versions A03 06/03/2012

Error message: `Invalid partition table!`

Dell XPS L702X/03RG89, Samsung RV520
------------------------------------

Do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB Installer.

We were reported that the legacy BIOS shipped on these systems doesn't
know how to deal with the GPT partition scheme installed by Tails
USB Installer.

Dell Inspiron 8100
------------------

The display panel will have the wrong resolution unless `video=LVDS-1:1600x1200
nouveau.noaccel=1` is added to the boot command line.

ThinkPad X220 / T520
--------------------

See the corresponding [[ticket|/bugs/ThinkPad_X220_vs_GPT]].

"Connect automatically" for NetworkManager connections isn't persistent.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the "Network Connections" persistence feature is
activated, the "Connect automatically" settings isn't saved for any
connection.  While this is a bug, it's actually a good
one. NetworkManager itself enables this option by default for all new
connections, and could result in users re-connecting to a previous network at
times when they don't want that.

After using the Tails USB installer, the "emergency shutdown" doesn't work.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tails USB installer messes a bit too much with the USB devices for the
"emergency shutdown on media removal" feature to continue working after using
it. If you believe this feature is critical for the session you're running, we
advice you to reboot Tails.

Tails fails to connect to certain Wi-Fi networks
------------------------------------------------

This may be related to the introduction of wireless regulation support
in Tails 0.13.

Tails DVD eject failure
-----------------------

Pressing the DVD eject button does not trigger emergency shutdown.
Also, the "normal" (non-emergency) shutdown procedure does not eject
the DVD anymore.

(Ticket: [[todo/fix_DVD_eject_at_shutdown]])

Stream isolation inconsistency in Claws Mail
--------------------------------------------

Claws Mail isn't using its dedicated Tor SocksPort for Tor hidden
service IMAP/POP/SMTP servers (instead Tor's TransPort is used). This
is just a deviation from Tails' design and should have no adverse real
world consequences.
