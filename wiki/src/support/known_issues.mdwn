Problems starting Tails
=======================

Apple hardware
--------------

For the moment, Tails has a very limited support for Apple hardware.

Most recent Apple hardware does not boot without UEFI, and currently
Tails does not start with UEFI. See [[!tails_todo UEFI desc="the corresponding ticket"]].

See also [[manual USB installation with
Mac|doc/first_steps/manual_usb_installation/mac]] for more compatibility
reports, as well as [[!tails_bug
Some_old_Macbooks_running_Lion_10.7_not_booting_Lion..can_we_get_booting_fixed___63__
desc="this bug report"]].

Dell Inc. Latitude E6430/0CPWYR
-------------------------------

Do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB Installer.

With BIOS versions A03 06/03/2012

Error message: `Invalid partition table!`

Dell XPS L702X/03RG89, Samsung RV520
------------------------------------

Do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB Installer.

We were reported that the legacy BIOS shipped on these systems doesn't
know how to deal with the GPT partition scheme installed by Tails
USB Installer.

<http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/19392884/20010995.aspx>

Dell Inspiron 8100
------------------

The display panel will have the wrong resolution unless `video=LVDS-1:1600x1200
nouveau.noaccel=1` is added to the boot command line.

Dell Dimension 2400
-------------------

Cannot start neither from USB nor from DVD. System crashes with a blank
screen and locked up keyboard.

ThinkPad X220, T520 and E325
----------------------------

See the corresponding [[!tails_bug ThinkPad_X220_vs_GPT desc="ticket"]].

ASUSTeK G75VW
-------------

Since Tails 0.17.1 starts all right with "failsafe" mode but not
otherwise.

Security issues
===============

Tails may not erase all the system memory on shutdown
-----------------------------------------------------

On rare systems (non-PAE with big amounts of memory),
Tails does not consistently [[!tails_todo
more_efficient_memory_wipe desc="erase all system memory as it
should"]].

After using the Tails USB installer, the "emergency shutdown" doesn't work.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tails USB installer messes a bit too much with the USB devices for the
"emergency shutdown on media removal" feature to continue working after using
it. If you believe this feature is critical for the session you're running, we
advice you to reboot Tails.

Tails DVD eject failure
-----------------------

Pressing the DVD eject button does not trigger emergency shutdown.
Also, the "normal" (non-emergency) shutdown procedure does not eject
the DVD anymore.

(Ticket: [[!tails_todo fix_DVD_eject_at_shutdown]])

Stream isolation inconsistency in Claws Mail
--------------------------------------------

Claws Mail isn't using its dedicated Tor SocksPort for Tor hidden
service IMAP/POP/SMTP servers (instead Tor's TransPort is used). This
is just a deviation from Tails' design and should have no adverse real
world consequences.

Tails fails to completely shutdown or restart
---------------------------------------------

When stopping Tails on some hardware, the memory wipe procedure fails to
complete: the display gets scrambled, but the computer doesn't
completely shutdown or restart. Sometimes the caps-lock button light of
the keyboard flashes.

<div class="caution">
When this happen, there is no guarantee that the memory is wiped entirely.
</div>

This issue has been reported on the following hardware:

  - Hewlett-Packard HP Pavilion dv6 Notebook PC
  - Lenovo ThinkPad X61, only on emergency shutdown when pulling out the
    USB stick
  - Toshiba Satellite C855D
  - Dell Inc. Studio 1458
  - Fujitsu Lifebook AH531/GFO, only on regular shutdown, emergency
    shutdown works

Other issues
============

Connecting to FTP servers is not possible
-----------------------------------------

Public FTP servers on the Internet are not reachable using Tails.
See [[!tails_todo fix_Internet_FTP_support desc="the corresponding
task"]] for more details.

YouTube video are hard to get
-----------------------------

[[!tails_todo easier_YouTube desc="HTML5 video are not easily seen on YouTube"]]. When the
message *This video is currently unavailable* appears, the video can actually be viewed.
Right-click on the page, select **NoScript** → **Blocked objects** and
**Temporarily allow…** the video.

Tails will never support videos which requires Flash (those with ads).

"Connect automatically" for NetworkManager connections isn't persistent
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When the "Network Connections" persistence feature is
activated, the "Connect automatically" settings isn't saved for any
connection.  While this is a bug, it's actually a good
one. NetworkManager itself enables this option by default for all new
connections, and could result in users re-connecting to a previous network at
times when they don't want that.

Tails fails to connect to certain Wi-Fi networks
------------------------------------------------

This may be related to the introduction of wireless regulation support
in Tails 0.13.

Tails could behave better when run inside VirtualBox
----------------------------------------------------

Since 0.17.1, VirtualBox guest modules are no shipped anymore.

See [[!tails_todo fix_virtualbox_guest_modules_build desc="the
corresponding task"]] for details.
