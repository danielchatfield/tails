**WARNING**: this documentation, originally written for Incognito, has
not been fully adapted for T(A)ILS yet. It is thus incomplete, plainly
lies on some points, and lacks screenshots.

TODO:

- finish adapting instructions from TorK to Vidalia
- adapt instructions from Thunderbird to Claws Mail
- instruct how to really "change identity"
- GnuPG + Seahorse
- FireGPG

# <a name="intro"></a>Introduction

In this document we try to present The (Amnesic) Incognito Live
System in an easy to understand and reasonably thorough manner in hope
to give the new user a crash course in what might be a completely new
set of applications and concepts regarding anonymity and security on
the Internet.

It is quite long so you might want to not read it in one go but
instead read the introduction and conclusion, as well as the sections
on only those applications you intend to use with the possibility to
return to it whenever you want to try something new or use it for
reference.

If you have experience with these applications and concepts from
elsewhere and feel comfortable with the user interface in general,
reading this document is maybe not necessary at all. A word of caution
to all users is not to alter the network, proxy and firewall settings
unless you know what you are doing – poking around with them too much
might spoil the built-in defences of T(A)ILS.

## <a name="what"></a>What is T(A)ILS?

Amnesia, **noun**: Forgetfulness; loss of long-term memory.

Incognito, **noun**:

1. One unknown or in disguise, or under an assumed character or name.
2. The assumption of disguise or of a feigned character; the state of
   being in disguise or not recognized.

T(A)ILS is a [Free
Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
[LiveDistro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livedistro) based on [Debian
GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) assisting you to securely and
anonymously use the Internet almost anywhere you go, e.g. your home,
work, university, favourite Internet café or local library.

T(A)ILS is designed to be used from either a CD or a [USB
drive](#usb).

T(A)ILS has several applications (Web browser, IRC client, Mail
client, Instant messenger, office suite, image and sound manipulation,
etc.) pre-configured with security in mind; all outgoing connections
to the Internet are forced to go through [the Tor
network](https://www.torproject.org/), whose purpose is to protect
them against traffic analysis. Moreover, T(A)ILS is designed to leave
no trace on local storage devices unless explicitely asked.

To use it, you simply insert the CD or USB-drive that you have
installed T(A)ILS on in a computer and restart it. T(A)ILS should
then start as an independent operating system instead of Microsoft
Windows or whatever operating system you have installed. You might
need to select the inserted boot device in the BIOS, or using some
kind of boot menu (try F12).

## <a name="why"></a>Why do you need anonymity?

In case you did not know, we currently find ourselves in a state of
steady decline of our freedoms and privacy, with increasing levels of
mass surveillance and repression all over the world (see [this report
from Privacy
International](http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-559597)).

Without taking any precautions, your Internet service provider, the
state, the police and global surveillance systems like
[ECHELON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) (which is _not_ a
conspiracy theory; see [this report from the European
Parliament](http://www.fas.org/irp/program/process/rapport_echelon_en.pdf))
can record what you do online: what you read, what you write and who
you communicate with.

This is possible since all messages sent over
the Internet contain the [IP
addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ip_address) of both the sender
and receiver, much like an ordinary mail sent through the postal
system contain addresses of both sender and receiver for two-way
communication. IP addresses can easily be traced back to the physical
location of the computers and their owners, and from that ultimately
back to you.

If you do not mind this fact, then more power to you, but if you do
mind, then T(A)ILS might be just what you need.

Moreover, just like with a postcard, any information traveling on the
Internet can be read by many computers that relay them.

## <a name="why_notrace"></a>Why do you need to prevent traces to be kept?

A lot of traces of your activities are left on your computer's hard
disk. Such traces can easily be gathered by anyone with a bit of
computer knowledge when no special measure is taken to prevent this
(the only serious one being full disk encryption).

Again, if you do mind this fact, T(A)ILS might be just what you need.

## <a name="how"></a>How does T(A)ILS provide with anonymity?

First of all, true anonymity is impossible. Given enough resources an
attacker will get you. What one can do is to make the cost of doing
that so high that it becomes infeasible.

T(A)ILS tries to do this by sending all your Internet traffic through
the [Tor™ network](https://www.torproject.org/) which makes your
Internet traffic very hard to trace. If someone tries to trace you
when you are using T(A)ILS, the trail will stop somewhere in Tor
network with the IP addresses of some of its participants, not your.
Similarly, if someone tries to see destination of your traffic, they
will only reach as far as some computer in the Tor network. In fact,
you will be the only one knowing exactly what is going on – not even
the computers in the Tor network that you send your traffic through
will know the whole picture!

As at least a rudimentary understanding of Tor currently is essential
for using it securely (and knowing its limits) we strongly recommend
reading the [Tor overview](https://www.torproject.org/overview.html)
and [Understanding and Using Tor – An Introduction for the
Layman](https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorALaymansGuide).
At the very least you should read the following paragraphs about
common misconceptions about the service offered by the Tor software.

By relaying your Internet traffic through the Tor network (which
T(A)ILS does per default) your communications should _only_ be
considered to be untraceable back to the computer you use, not
encrypted or in any other way unreadable by others. While the traffic
_is_ encrypted when it leaves your computer and when you get back your
responses, it will not necessarily be so when sent between the Tor
network and your destination (this is unavoidable for technical
reasons). This means that an eavesdropper at some later point will be
able see your traffic without Tor's encryption unless you take further
precautions (described [later on](#ff)), but will not be able to link
it back to your computer.

As such, if you are sending or receiving sensitive data whose
disclosure would be damaging in itself even if it is untraceable, you
need to use end-to-end encryption to hide the meaning of your data to
everyone except the recipient. Examples of such sensitive information
that you need to protect in this way are your real identity or other
personal information linkable to you, login details and passwords,
bank account or financial details, anything illegal or political, and
secrets in general.

There are several tools bundled with T(A)ILS offering end-to-end
encryption for various applications: [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org/)
provides with encryption for email,
[OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr) is for instant messaging (MSN,
ICQ, IRC, etc.) among others.

Also, bear in mind that while web browsing on sites for whom the
addresses begin with `http://` the connections are not encrypted (see
[more about this](#ff)). However, web sites whose addresses start with
`https://` (notice the additional "**s**") use encrypted connections
and are thus **s**ecure. FIXME: tell a bit about certificates and
X.509 limits. Many web browsers, including Firefox, also display a
lock or a similar symbol in the address field or status bar indicating
that the connection is secure.

Notice that not all web sites offer this feature, but most that in any
way handle your data (webmail logins, bank account logins etc.)
usually do. Keep your eyes open!

Furthermore, most software bundled with T(A)ILS will warn you when
your previously encrypted connection switches to unencrypted mode: be
careful!

At last, some applications have features and services that may
compromise the anonymity offered by the Tor network. All modern web
browsers, such as Firefox, support
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript), [Adobe
Flash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_flash),
[Cookies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) and other services
which have been shown to be able to defeat the anonymity provided by
the Tor network.

For instance, a web page using JavaScript can make your web browser
send your real IP address to the web server hosting the web page which
possibly can disclose it not only to the web server's owner but also
eavesdroppers that happen to fetch the message when it is sent between
the Tor network and the web server. Even if most web pages using
JavaScript do not do this, it is important to be very cautious when
determining which sites you allow to use these extra features. FIXME:
T(A)ILS currently hasn't NoScript.

When running Iceweasel (Firefox) in T(A)ILS all such features are
handled by an extension called
[Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/) which does all
sorts of things to prevent the above type of attacks. But that comes
at a price – since this will disable some functionality, certain sites
might not work as intended.

## <a name="how_amnesia"></a>How does T(A)ILS provide with amnesia?

FIXME: translate from French.

# <a name="howto"></a>How to use T(A)ILS

FIXME: merge the paragraph bellow with the French, expanded and
adapted version "Quelques précisions au sujet de l'utilisation de
T(A)ILS".

Some other important things that need to be understood before
proceeding are the concepts of [LiveDistro, LiveCD and
LiveUSB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livedistro). In essence a
LiveDistro is an operating system (like Windows or Mac OS X, although
T(A)ILS uses Linux) that is run from some removable media like a CD or
USB drive. Most likely you are running T(A)ILS from a CD, which makes
it into a LiveCD, and this brings some limitations to its operation.
Most importantly, since the CD is a read-only medium once it has been
burned by your CD recording software no changes persist through
reboots. So, if you download a file or make some application settings
they will be gone once you shut-down. This is both good and bad – on
the plus side, if you screw up anything or get a virus, the system
will be restored once you have restarted it. But not being able to
save stuff is of course inconvenient in some cases. If you find it
frustrating you might want to run T(A)ILS from a USB drive instead,
making it into a LiveUSB. Since a USB drive is writeable medium it is
possible to make it so that the changes persist through reboots. You
can read more about this and its implications [later](#usb)
[on](#persistent) in this walkthrough.

In this section we will now briefly present the main applications
included in T(A)ILS. Users are encouraged to look for further
information about them elsewhere and to experiment (while not doing
anything sensitive!) for their own benefit. All the pictures are
clickable to get them undistorted and in full size, but note that some
of the text is smudged in order to protect identities. Let us take a
look at the T(A)ILS desktop:

FIXME: screenshot

<center><a href="img/incognito-screenshot.png"><img border="0"
height="384" src="img/incognito-screenshot.png" width="512"
/></a></center>

The graphical user interface used in T(A)ILS is called GNOME and
shares many fundamentals with that of Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and
most other modern operating systems, so if you have used any of them,
getting used to GNOME will take no time. As this document is not
intended as a complete guide for GNOME there are only a few things about
it that we will mention here to spare you some time.

First of all, in the upper left corner of the screen there is a button
with a logo in it, followed by three menus: *Applications*,
*Shortcuts* and *System*.

FIXME: check the English names.

The *Applications* menu is where you will find short cuts to the
installed applications. Please explore the different categories of
applications and try out those that seem interesting.

The *Shortcuts* menu is here to make it easy to access storage media.

The *System* menu allows to:

* customize some aspects of the GNOME desktop (*Preferences*);
* change some important aspects of the system and hardware behavior
(*Administration*);
* shutdown the computer.

On the right of these three menu entries, a few shortcuts allow to
launch the most frequently used applications. Passing the mouse cursor
over one of these shortcut will display the application name and its
function.

In the upper right corner you will find a couple of icons, each which
offers an interface for some running application : the onion icon is
made to control Tor, the two computer screens are for the network
settings. Other icons help you keep an eye on the battery level if you
run from a laptop, one allows to instantly change the keyboard layout,
another controls the sound level. Note that the clock icon allows to
change the current timezone to make it show the local time.

You are encouraged to check these icons out with the left and right
mouse buttons, but we will say more about some of them later on in
this article.

FIXME: check the English names

At the center of the screen is a vast area called the Desktop. A
*Computer* icon provides access to storage media; the *Personal
folder* is a shortcut to the default folder where most applications
save the files; then comes the shortcut to this documentation, and
another allows to report a bug in T(A)ILS to its developers; to end
with, the Trash is the place where "deleted" files are moved.

When media storage is connected to the computer, additional icons
appear on the Desktop.

On the bottom of the screen is another panel: on its left, an icon
allows to minimize all open windows to show the Desktop; then come the
buttons for open windows; on the right, a set of four similar
rectangle icons gives access to four different workspaces.

## <a name="nm"></a>Networking with NetworkManager

The name is quite self-explanatory – this is what you should use
manage your network, which usually only consists of establishing an
Internet connection. In many cases this is done more or less
automatically. For example, if you are connected with wire
NetworkManager will try to obtain network access automatically. If you
want to connect via wireless with a supported wireless adapter, you
are basically two clicks away.

First click its icon in the systray to summon the list of available
connections:

FIXME: screenshot

<center><a href="img/nm-menu.png"><img border="0" height="194"
src="img/nm-menu.png" width="240" /></a></center>

All wireless networks your computer is picking up are listed there, as
are all wired networks you have access to (usually one per wire), so
the second click is used for choosing any one of these. If the network
is protected you will be prompted for a password. There are other
options too, e.g. for dial-up connections and setting up VPNs although
these will require further set-up in the "Options -> Configure..."
section.

## <a name="vidalia"></a>Controlling Tor with Vidalia

Vidalia is an anonymity manager. Basically this means that it can be used
to control Tor, and is automatically launched on startup.

As soon as the Tor client managed to establish a route to the Tor
network, Vidalia hides as an onion icon on the upper right corner of
the screen. Right-clicking this icon displays a configuration menu.

FIXME: screenshot

<center><a href="img/tork-main.png"><img border="0" height="325"
src="img/tork-main.png" width="400" /></a></center>

FIXME: translate the French paragraph here.

Let's describe the two most important features of the Vidalia
configuration menu:

FIXME: check the English names

* Tor network map: the list of currently used routes and their status.
* New identity: clicking this button will make Tor use a different
  route for **future** connections, so that they will appear to come
  from a different address.

FIXME: translate this from French, and move it where it seems more
appropriate.

  Mais **ATTENTION** : ceci ne fonctionne que si aucune connexion
  n'est restée ouverte lors du renouvellement de la route. Pour être
  tout à fait assuré à cet égard, il peut être bon de *fermer le
  navigateur, ou tout logiciel utilisant le réseau*, puis de *changer
  d'identité*, et d'*attendre que l'icône informant du changement
  d'identité ait disparu*, avant de rouvrir le logiciel.


Next we will have a look at the Tor network map:

FIXME: screenshot

<center><a href="img/tork-network.png"><img border="0" height="325"
src="img/tork-network.png" width="400" /></a></center>

In here, all the Tor nodes in the Tor network are listed, as are all
your circuits and connections that go through the Tor network. All
this requires a bit of technical knowledge of how Tor works in order
to understand and use, but it is not at all necessary. From the
connection listing it should at least be relatively easy for you to
see which exit node and country it appears your connections come from.

One very useful thing when working with Tor is the following option,
found in the TorK menu that you get by right-clicking its systray
icon:

<center><a href="img/tork-menu.png"><img border="0" height="98"
src="img/tork-menu.png" width="182" /></a></center>

The selected "Change Identity" option will tear down all you current
circuits and build new ones which means that the set of computers you
route your Internet traffic through will exchanged by some others.
This is very useful if you experience bad performance or even
time-outs accessing some Internet resource as you might have better
luck with the new circuits that are built. Also, if you ever want to
make sure that one thing you are doing will not be linkable to the
next thing you are going to do you should use this feature.

TorK also makes it easy to use some of the Tor Network's more advanced
features. For example, if you switch back to the "Anonymize" tab you
will find an entry for "Anonymous Websites and Web Services" which
allows you to set up [hidden
services](http://www.torproject.org/hidden-services.html) by clicking
its icon (an English style police hat). Another feature that might be
useful when you are using T(A)ILS from a restrictive network can be
found in "Settings menu -&gt; Configure TorK -&gt; Firewall/Censor
evasion". This makes it possible to use
[bridges](https://www.torproject.org/bridges.html) as entry points to
the Tor network in order to circumvent censorship systems that blocks
normal access to the Tor network, intentially or not.

Lastly TorK will assist you setting up yourself as a Tor server,
helping out the Tor Network by relaying other people's traffic. You
also have the possibility to act as an exit node, which means that
other Tor users' traffic will exit in the clear from your computer.
You should really think through if you want to do the latter (act as
an exit node) as your ISP might start sending you complaints for other
people's file sharing traffic that happens to exit from you, and
potentially even worse things that might attract the attention of the
police. But simply relaying traffic is completely safe and will only
cost you some bandwidth (how much can be configured). However, at the
same time you will get more anonymity – it will be impossible for
eavesdroppers to distinguish the Tor traffic you are relaying from
your own traffic generated by web browsing etc. So if you have
bandwidth to spare, you might want to consider doing this.

In order to succeed with setting up a relay you might have to do
something about your firewall or router if you have one, like enable
port-forwarding for ports 9001 and 9030 – if you do not know what this
is or how to do it you should either look it up on with favourite
search engine or simply skip it. The next step would be to actually
enable it in TorK, which only requires a few clicks. First press the
button with a plus icon called "More options" which will make a few
more buttons and options appear. One of them says "Run as a server"
when you hover the mouse cursor above it. Simply click it and choose
"Relay Tor traffic" and follow the instructions. After that you will
just have to wait for half an hour or so before the connections start
rushing in. Due to this delay and some technical reasons it is best if
you only act as a Tor server if you [run from USB](#usb) as that will
speed things up a little next time and also spare you of the time
taken to set-up the server.

## <a name="ff"></a>Browsing the web with Firefox

Given Mozilla Firefox's recent surge in popularity many of you have
probably used it before. Its user interface is like any other modern
web browser, but there are a few things we want to mention, some that
is special with this particular installation. Do you remember what we
said [earlier](#how) about end-to-end encryption and its importance
while using Tor? Here is how it looks in Firefox when you are using a
secure, end-to-end encrypted connection:

<center><a href="img/ff-ssl.png"><img border="0" height="311"
src="img/ff-ssl.png" width="404" /></a></center>

Notice the locks in the status bar and address bar (the latter which
also has turned yellowish) and that the address begins with
"http**s**://" – these are the indicators that a secure connection
using [SSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer) is
being used. You should try to only use services that use secure
connections when you are required to send sensitive information (like
passwords), otherwise its very easy for an eavesdropper to steal
whatever information you are sending. In this case what we are trying
to do is logging in on an email account at
[lavabit](http://lavabit.com/), using their [webmail
interface](https://lavabit.com/apps/webmail/src/login.php). Let us
proceed with logging in there so we can se how it is possible to send
end-to-end encrypted email with any webmail service out there with the
nifty [FireGPG](http://getfiregpg.org/) extension:

<center><a href="img/ff-compose-1.png"><img border="0" height="311"
src="img/ff-compose-1.png" width="404" /></a></center>

Here we have written a silly email to Bob, mentioning stuff like
"public" and "private" keys. If you do not know what this means but
are interested in sending encrypted email, we suggest you take
yourself some time and read up on [public key
cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_cryptography)
and [PGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) just to
get the basic concepts.

What we will do next is first selecting all of the text in the message
(by using the mouse or simply pressing Ctrl + A) and then
right-clicking somewhere on the selected text. This will make the
usual Firefox context menu appear, which has a FireGPG entry that we
are interested in. Clicking it will expand the following menu:

<center><a href="img/ff-firegpg.png"><img border="0" height="137"
src="img/ff-firegpg.png" width="96" /></a></center>

In the menu we choose "Sign and encrypt" and we get a dialogue asking
us to select the public key to encrypt it with (Bob's) and the private
key to sign it with (your). After doing this the message is only
readable by Bob, and in addition Bob will be able to verify that the
message was in fact written by you. The signed and encrypted text will
look something like this:

<center><a href="img/ff-compose-2.png"><img border="0" height="311"
src="img/ff-compose-2.png" width="404" /></a></center>

At this stage we are ready to press send. When Bob receives this email
he can also use FireGPG to decrypt it in a very similar way – he will
just have to select the encrypted message and then use the FireGPG
menu to choose "Verify" or "Decrypt", or both. This can be done with
any so called PGP block. There is one important limitation in FireGPG,
though. It cannot generate new keys, so you will have to use another
application for that. We recommend using the [GNU Privacy
Assistant](#gpa), found under the "Utilities" section of the K menu,
or [KPGP](#kpgp), found in the "Utilities -&gt; PIM" section.

Returning to web browsing again we need to do something about the
problems with JavaScript, cookies and Adobe Flash that you might
remember from an earlier section. To deal with these problems we use
an extension called [Torbutton](https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/)
which is specifically designed for dealing with them (and other
things) for Firefox in combination with Tor. Torbutton can be either
switched on or off, indicated by "Tor enabled" and "Tor disabled" in
the Firefox status bar in the bottom right of its window. It should be
noted that these labels are a bit misleading for T(A)ILS users as Tor
cannot be switched off. So, in our case "Tor enabled" means that
Torbutton will disable a lot of stuff that could harm anonymity, and
"Tor disabled" simply means that you only get Tor and no additional
protection. As such, you should only disable Torbutton for sites that
you trust.

But why would you ever disable Torbutton? Well, while it is enabled
some sites might not work as you expect them to since certain features
are disabled or will behave differently. For example, the popular
video service [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/) will not work
properly as you can see here when we are trying to watch [this
clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIDxDMwwlsw):

<center><a href="img/ff-youtube-1.png"><img border="0" height="311"
src="img/ff-youtube-1.png" width="404" /></a></center>

In order to get the video player to show up, we will have to disable
Torbutton by clicking its panel in the Firefox status bar. Normally
this would disable the use of Tor completely, but as we have mentioned
earlier, nothing escapes Tor while running T(A)ILS so your connection
will still be anonymized. However, you will have to trust that Google
(the current owner of youtube) is not doing anything fishy with all
their JavaScripts, the Flash-based video player etc. that could break
your anonymity.

After disabling Torbutton we can finally learn how onion routing (the
technique used by the Tor network) works from the guys in the TV
series Numb3rs!

<center><a href="img/ff-youtube-2.png"><img border="0" height="311"
src="img/ff-youtube-2.png" width="404" /></a></center>

If you are reading this document as a local file in T(A)ILS (which is
the case if the address begins with file://) you might have noticed
that all links that point outside of this document do not work. This
is also due to Torbutton since it is possible for others to steal any
file from you otherwise. In order to visit them you will need to
disable Torbutton and reload the page in a new tab. Indeed there are a
few more oddities related to toggling Torbutton on and off. If a web
site does not work as expected after toggling Torbutton you might have
to do any of the following to get it to work:

* Press the "Refresh" button in the navigation bar, or imply use the
  F5 keyboard short cut.
* Click the address field and press ENTER.
* Open a new tab and re-enter (or copy and paste) the address into the
  address field of the new tab and then press ENTER.

This is a security feature, also used for separating the different
states in Firefox, which otherwise could lead to trouble (arguably a
bit less so for T(A)ILS users).

As we hope you understand by know, there are reasons for all these
quirks, and while they might be annoying we hope you will learn to
cope with them. If not, feel free to disable Torbutton and never use
it again, but in that case you should expect much less anonymity and
security. There have been several demonstration of uncovering the true
identities of Firefox users using Tor, but to the authors' knowledge
Torbutton protects you against all of them.

## <a name="tb"></a>Emailing with Thunderbird

Not everyone is happy using webmail (like the authors) but want to use
a _real_ email client instead of some fragile web-based interface. For
that we have included Mozilla Thunderbird which looks like this:

<center><a href="img/tb-main.png"><img border="0" height="305"
src="img/tb-main.png" width="453" /></a></center>

Composing email looks like this:

<center><a href="img/tb-compose.png"><img border="0" height="257"
src="img/tb-compose.png" width="324" /></a></center>

Notice that there are buttons for PGP encryption in both of the above
windows (labelled with "Decrypt" and "OpenPGP"). These are provided by
the [Enigmail](http://http://enigmail.mozdev.org/) extension, and
pressing any of them for the first time will start a guide for setting
up PGP, possibly generating new keys if you do not have any. Their web
site is a great resource for learning how PGP encryption works so make
sure to check it out.

Setting up your email account requires a tiny amount of knowledge,
like what [POP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol),
[IMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP) and
[SMTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP) is, and indeed that your
email service supports these. [This step-by-step
guide](http://opensourcearticles.com/articles/thunderbird_15/english/part_01)
might be useful. However, this initial configuration requires writing
down the addresses of the servers involved, downloading mail, etc.
which will take some time. It is a bit annoying to have to redo
everytime you start T(A)ILS, which is necessary when running from a
CD, so you might want to consider using a persistent home directory by
[running from USB](#usb) if you plan to use Thunderbird often. One
more thing to consider is that Tor exit nodes usually block the
plaintext SMTP port (25) in order to prevent spam. This is easily
fixed by enabling end-to-end encryption with the email server through
SSL, which you should do any way for all of POP, IMAP and SMTP as your
password otherwise will be sent in plaintext.

## <a name="nautilus"></a>Managing files with Nautilus

Nautilus is GNOME's file manager, (S)FTP client and more and it looks like this
while in file managing mode:

FIXME: adapt screenshot

<center><a href="img/konq.png"><img border="0" height="257"
src="img/konq.png" width="354" /></a></center>

To manage local files, follow links on the desktop or from "Places" menu at top
left corner of the screen. To move files or folders, you can drag them from one
window and drop them to another.

To connect to remote FTP or SFTP server, go to "Connect to Server..." from
"Places" menu.

## <a name="pidgin"></a>Chatting with Pidgin

For instant messaging T(A)ILS includes the Pidgin Instant Messenger.
It is a multi-protocol client, so you can run MSN, ICQ, IRC, AIM,
Jabber and many other protocols at the same time, even with several
instances of the same protocol. See the following picture for a Pidgin
user with three different protocols enabled at the same time:

<center><a href="img/pidgin-main.png"><img border="0" height="196"
src="img/pidgin-main.png" width="109" /></a></center>

Of course the issue of end-to-end encryption arises again. As we
mentioned earlier, we have [Off-the-record
messaging](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr) (commonly called OTR) for
instant messaging, and Pidgin and many other instant messengers have
support for that. There are several resources on how it works and how
to use it on their web site. Basically all you need to do is choose
"Start private conversation" in the OTR menu and a key will be
generated automatically if you do not have one already. After that OTR
will establish a private conversation if the other end's instant
messenger supports it. This is will look something like this:

<center><a href="img/pidgin-chat.png"><img border="0" height="218"
src="img/pidgin-chat.png" width="370" /></a></center>

OTR and other Pidgin plugins are enabled in the "Tools menu -&gt;
Plug-ins" section. Simply check the appropriate box for enabling any
plugin you want, and possibly you might also want to configure it by
pressing the "Configure Plug-in" button. When this is done for the OTR
plugin a window that can be used to manage your keys will be opened.
The use of OTR is recommended as many instant messaging protocols
normally send your messages in plaintext. Force your friends to
migrate to clients with support for OTR!

## <a name="misc"></a>Other applications

There are several other interesting security or Internet related
applications included in T(A)ILS some which we list and present
briefly here. Those that have graphical user interfaces (which most
do) can be found in the K menu.

* [GNU Privacy Guard](http://www.gnupg.org/) (GnuPG) – A Free
  implementation of OpenPGP used for encryption of all sorts.
* <a name="gpa"></a>[GNU Privacy
  Assistant](http://www.gnupg.org/gpa.html) – A graphical user
  interface for GnuPG. This application is very useful for generating
  and importing new keys.
* <a name="kpgp"></a>[KGPG](http://developer.kde.org/~kgpg/) – Another
  graphical user interface for GnuPG, very similar to GNU Privacy
  Assistant. This one has a text editor under the "File" menu which
  can be used to easily sign and/or encrypt any texts you write or
  paste into the text box. This might be useful for sending encrypted,
  anonymous email with TorK's Mixminion interface.
* <a name="keepassx"></a>[KeePassX](http://keepassx.sourceforge.net/)
  – A password manager and generator. For password generation, look in
  the "Extras" menu. The generator has a pretty cool feature, namely
  that it show the quality (or [information
  entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_entropy)) of the
  password it will generate.
*
  [Kvkbd](http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/Kvkbd?content=56019)
  – A virtual keyboard that can be used to safely enter passwords
  using the mouse when you suspect that a hardware keylogger may be
  present. It starts automatically with T(A)ILS and is accessed by the
  keyboard icon in the systray.
* [TrueCrypt](http://www.truecrypt.org/) – Disk encryption software.
  If you have access to some writeable media you can use TrueCrypt for
  creating an encrypted container (which in reality will take the form
  of an ordinary file on that media) on it that you can store files in
  securely.
* <a name="vidalia"></a>[Vidalia](http://www.vidalia-project.net/) –
  An alternative Tor controller.
* [KTorrent](http://ktorrent.org/) – A Bittorrent client. Please use
  bittorrent with care as it is a real burden for the Tor network and
  generally frowned upon in the Tor community because of this. Just
  downloading a 10 MB file could be equivalent of hours of standard
  web browsing. Therefore you should only download small files when
  absolutely necessary.
* [XChat](http://www.xchat.org/) – A more traditional IRC client
  compared to Pidgin (some people just prefer it that way).
  Unfortunately there is no OTR plugin or other means for end-to-end
  encryption provided so use this with care.
* [Krdc](http://www.kde.org/) – A Remote Desktop client supporting VNC
  and RDP.

## <a name="macchanger"></a>Enabling MAC changer

If you paid attention when you started up T(A)ILS you may have noticed
an odd option in the language selection menu, namely the "Enable MAC
changer" entry. Some further explanation is probably required in order
to understand whether this is relevant for you or not.

First of all, you should know that all network cards, both wired and
wireless, have a unique identifier stored in them called their MAC
address. This address is actually used to address your computer on the
_local_ network, but it will _never_ get out on the Internet so people
can _not_ use it to trace you. However, other computers on the network
could log it which then would provide proof that your computer have
been connected to it. As such, this is not a concern if you are using
T(A)ILS with your home Internet connection as that can be linked to
you any way, but if you are connecting your computer to an untrusted,
public wireless network you might consider enabling it. It is never
useful enabling this option if you are using a public computer – only
use this if you are using a computer that can be linked to you on a
public network.

The reason why this is not always enabled is that is might cause
problems on some networks, so if you experience network problems while
it is enabled you might want try disabling it.

## <a name="usb"></a>Running T(A)ILS from USB

Running T(A)ILS from a CD has its virtues but it certainly also have
its limitations. While CDs are portable they usually do not fit in
your pocket in a comfortable manner. But a USB memory stick certainly
fits any pocket or your key ring. In addition, CDs are read-only and
thus no data can be saved to them, but that is, again, not the case
with USB drives. However, storing sensitive data on writeable media
could be dangerous if it got into the wrong hands. Similarly, if we
get a virus or manages to damage the system in other ways, the system
is tainted or unusable from that point and all consecutive boots,
either with or without your knowledge. Clearly that is not good.

It is actually possible to get the best out of these two worlds at the
same time. When running T(A)ILS from a USB drive you have the option
to create an encrypted container wherein your home directory is stored
so that any files stored and settings made are saved persistently. If
you use a good password this deals with the dangers of storing
sensitive data on it. For more information on this, see the section on
using a [persistent home directory](#persistent). But what about virus
threats and the like? Well, when running from a USB drive, the system
files are still set up to not be persistently writeable. It is only
your home directory which will be persistent.

### Installation instructions

In order to get T(A)ILS running from USB you currently have to get the
usual LiveCD installation first. Once T(A)ILS has started up from CD
you will find a short cut to an installation guide in the "T(A)ILS"
meni available from the panel and the K menu, aptly called "Install
T(A)ILS to USB". The guide will tell you about your options and is
self contained, and in most cases you only need to insert a USB drive,
choose the appropriate installation method and hit the OK button to
get it done. Then you restart the computer without the CD in, but with
the USB drive connected instead, and T(A)ILS should start to boot just
like from the CD.

### Updating T(A)ILS USB installation

If you have an existing T(A)ILS USB installation and want to update it
to a more recent release, simply use this script to overwrite the
existing installtion. Note that if a persistent home directory is
present you must choose option 1 ("Use an existing vfat partition on a
USB drive") and select the partition containing T(A)ILS in order to
keep it.

## <a name="persistent"></a>Persistent home directory

At a certain point when [booting T(A)ILS from USB](#usb) you will be
prompted with the question if you want a persistent home directory or
not. As mentioned elsewhere in this document, that will allow you to
save files and keep application settings between shutdowns, which is
not normally the case. Naturally, saving sensitive stuff could be
dangerious if it got into the wrong hands, so the use of encryption is
highly recommended.

As you progress through the guided setup of the persistent home
directory you will be asked as few questions and given some simple
instructions, and some of these might need to be commented a bit:

### Size

Early on you will be asked for the size of the "home volume", which
will be a file stored on the USB drive that in turn will store you
files. There are a few constraints on this size, like a minimum size
necessary to fit the initial application settings and files that are
part of \_\_INCOGNITO\_USER\_\_ users's home directory. There is also
a maximum size, which is the lowest of the space available on the
drive, and 4 GB (this is because of technical reasons – files larger
than 4 GB will not work).

### Encryption

It cannot be emphasized enough; use encryption! The encryption is
protected with a password, so it is very important to also choose a
strong password. But what is a strong password? Of course, there are
many different opinions on that. What can be said is that to utilize
the encryption algorithm used to its full extent you will need a
password consisting of 40 randomly chosen characters of those
available on the standard (western) keyboard layout, which have around
90 different characters. Such a password should remain uncrackable for
the remainder of this universe's life span and the same goes for the
actual encryption. Of course, such a password is almost impossible to
memorize, so you will probably have to go for something shorter. 20
random characters is probably enough. It can also help to device
mnemonics to help remember them but stay away from dictionary words of
any language you know. Be creative! If you need help with generating
the passwords you should check out [KeePassX](#keepassx)'s built-in
password generator.

If you use encryption (which you should) you will be prompted for the
password during boot. One thing that might strike you as odd is that
it is possible to enter two passwords. The reason for that will be
clarified in the next section, but normally you just type in your
password in one of them (which one doesn't matter) and press ENTER to
continue.

### Hidden volumes

In certain countries you may be legally forced to hand over encryption
keys or passwords, or otherwise facing penal charges. Clearly this
might defeat the whole purpose of using encryption, but luckily there
is a solution based on [plausible
deniability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability).

The idea is to create a so called hidden volume which resides in the
free space of the normal (or outer) volume, and using two different
passwords to access either of them; the normal password grants access
only to the normal volume and the hidden password grants access only
to the hidden volume. Given the normal password there is no way to
tell whether the hidden volume exists or not – the hidden password is
required for that. The point of all this is that you may hand over the
normal password to the authorities and keep the hidden password
secret, and they will not be able to tell whether you are fooling them
or not. Hence you get plausible deniability.

Setting up the hidden volume using the guided setup is pretty straight
forward. You will be asked how large it should be, and since it is
stored within the normal volume it must be smaller, but it is
important that you leave some additional in order to make room on the
normal volume. You will need to use the normal volume sometomes to do
innocent things so that it looks used, otherwise the authorities will
not believe you. However, when you do that by just specifying the
normal password you may damage the hidden volume as it resides in the
free space. Luckily you can supply both passwords at the same time,
which will open the normal volume but make it aware of the hidden
volume so you cannot damage it. So, whenever you are using the normal
volume to make it look used, enter both passwords (one in each field
at the password prompt, and order doesn't matter).

Naturally, you will also be asked for an additional password for the
hidden volume, and as always you should choose a good, strong
password. However, for the normal volume you can choose may choose a
weaker password that's easier to remember – it only needs to be good
enough to fool the authoroties that it is the real password. But
remember to **never** give the hidden password to anyone else, or even
mention to anybody that you are using a hidden volume or have two
passwords.

## <a name="cold"></a>Protection against cold boot attacks

What happens if the police knocks on your door when you are running
T(A)ILS? This is a tough one to deal with, and there is not that much
that can be done actually. If you are really unlucky they have brought
with them freeze spray and other equipment which can be used to mount
a [cold boot attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack).
This is done in order to get the contents of your RAM. Due to how
modern computing works, basically everything that you have been doing
for a good whike is stored in the RAM, so all information – including
passwords, encryption keys and the secret plans you wrote in a text
editor but then erased – may be stored in it in plain text. The more
resent the activity, the more likely it is that it is still in the
RAM.

RAM is usually considered to be extremely volatile, meaning that the
data itstores starts to disintegrate rapidly once power is removed.
However, it has been shown that the data might be recoverable for
seconds or even minutes after this happens, and apparently freeze
spray can be used to increase that period significantly. Once the
power is restored the RAM state will keep getting refreshed, so if the
power supply is portable the removed RAM modules' contents are in the
hands of the attacker. Alternatively the computer can simply be reset
(i.e. switched off and back on quickly), which barely even affects the
power. Then a tiny LiveCD system is loaded with the ability to dump
the RAM to some writeable media. In both cases the RAM contents can be
analysed in a computer forensics laboratory which might turn into a
major disaster depending on what they find.

So, what should you do when you hear them knocking? You should calmly
make a clean shut-down of T(A)ILS using the "Log out" option in the K
menu, then selecting "Turn off computer" in the window that appears.
Then you wait, possibly trying to buy valuable time by barricading
your door. There are two reasons for this:

1. If you are using an encrypted persistent home partition, the master
   encryption key will be cleared from RAM, preventing the intruders
   from getting it.
2. One of the last things T(A)ILS does before shutting down completely
   is filling the RAM with random junk, thus erasing everything that
   was stored there before. Unfortunately this might take a couple of
   minutes depending on the speed of your processor and the amount of
   RAM installed, so while this clearly is not a perfect solution it
   seems it might be the best thing to do.

As far as the authors know cold boot attacks are not standard
procedure within law enforcements and similar organisations anywhere
in the world yet, but it might still be good to be prepared and stay
on the safe side.

## <a name="vm"></a>T(A)ILS and Virtualization

Certain users might not want to restart the computer every time they
wish to use the Internet anonymously withT(A)ILS. For those, a so
called [virtual machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)
can be used to run T(A)ILS inside the "host" operating system
installed on the computer (e.g. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, etc.).
Essentially these programs emulate real computers that you can run
"guest" operating systems (in this case T(A)ILS) in so they appear in
a window within the host operating system. Using one of these
technologies allows for convenient access to T(A)ILS's features in a
protected environment while you at the same time have access to your
normal operation system.

There are a few security issues with this approach though. The main
issue is if the host operating system is compromised with a software
keylogger or virus, which T(A)ILS does not provide any protection
against (in fact, that is impossible). Secondly, performance is a
usually a bit worse compared to running it on its own. As such, this
is only recommended when the other alternative is not an option or
when you are absolutely sure that your host system is clean.
Additionally, some of these virtual machines are closed-source, so it
is very difficult to determine if they do something that could break
T(A)ILS's security. In conclusion, use virtual machines with care.

### QEMU

The open source [QEMU](http://bellard.org/qemu/) processor emulator
and virtualizer handles T(A)ILS nicely. In fact, QEMU is included in
the T(A)ILS distribution for Microsoft Windows users (more about this
[below](#windows)). In order to start it from the command-line, simply
type something like:

<pre>
	<code>qemu -usb -soundhw sb16 -localtime -boot d -cdrom
	/path/to/incognito.iso</code> </pre>

If you have severe performance problems you should look into KQEMU
which is an accelerator module for QEMU, granting a more direct access
to the systems hardware for additional speed. You will most likely
need administrator privileges for installing KQEMU.

### VMWare

T(A)ILS works very well in [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/) with the
following [VMWare Virtual
Appliance](http://files1.cjb.net/incognito/incognito-vmware-1.0.zip)
([signature](http://files1.cjb.net/incognito/incognito-vmware-1.0.zip.asc))
devised by the T(A)ILS developers. Simply unzip the file and follow
the provided instructions in `README.txt` which is provided within the
archive. The free ([as in
beer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre)) [VMWare
Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/) might be useful for
this. In order to get good performance you will probably need
administrator privileges in the computer when you install VMWare. Note
that VMWare is closed source, so it might be hard to determine if it
does anything that is bad for anonymity, although it is unlikely.

### VirtualBox

T(A)ILS runs in [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) without any major
conifuration necessary. Depending on your system you might need to
play around with the General -&gt; Advandced features to get it to
boot. On an AMD64 system using more than 4 GB of RAM the developers
have noted that the "Enable VT-x/AMD-V&amp;quit; (if your CPU supports
it) and "Enable PAE/NX" features are necessary, but your milage may
vary. VirtualBox is distributed both as a closed-source and as an
open-source (the so called OSE or Open Source Edition), the latter
which the T(A)ILS developer's encourages (although it currently lacks
USB support compared to the closed-source version).

## <a name="windows"></a>Running T(A)ILS from within Microsoft Windows

Thanks to QEMU, [described above](#vm), T(A)ILS can be run within
Microsoft Windows without the need to restart the computer. QEMU ships
with T(A)ILS, and is set up so you only have to insert the media when
Windows is running and a menu should appear with the option to start
T(A)ILS through it. This is especially useful when you are using a
computer you are not allowed to shut-down, which can be the case for
public computers in certain Internet cafés, libraries or other public
computers. Also, for some some general remarks on QEMU and T(A)ILS,
and some security concerns about this mode of operation, see the above
section on [T(A)ILS and Virtualization](#vm).

Since the T(A)ILS developers do not have access to any Windows
computers at the moment, any input if this actually works and how it
performs etc. is welcome.

## <a name="debug"></a>Debugging and trouble-shooting T(A)ILS

For the sake of security, T(A)ILS is a pretty locked down system: the
root user is inaccessible, and only a handful of tools are possible to
run with root privileges using the sudo command (see "sudo -l" for a
complete list of these commands). Since this can make debugging very
cumbersome (if not impossible) it is possible to make empty the root
user's password by passing "debugmode" to the kernel command-line.

# <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion

By offering you T(A)ILS we hope that you have the technological means
to stay anonymous on the Internet. However, we want to emphasize that
staying anonymous is _not_ only a technological problem – there is no
tool, including T(A)ILS and Tor, that will magically make you
anonymous on the Internet. You will have to behave as well. While deep
technical knowledge of the architecture of the Internet, cryptology,
traffic analysis techniques and the applications you use certainly can
help (mainly by knowing what _not_ to do), we believe that some good
ol' fashioned common sense and caution will be enough in most cases.
Among other things, that includes:

* Choosing good passwords and not writing them down in unprotected
  places.
* Using end-to-end encryption whenever possible.
* Not trusting everyone and everything but being a bit suspicious in
  general.
* Making an effort for properly authenticating with everyone you are
  communicating with.
* Being very careful when dealing with identifying information such as
  name, whereabouts, the local time and so on. Any such piece of
  information that you leak will help a would be adversary to get
  closer to you.

Also, please try to follow the instructions given by security tools as
much to the letter as possible. There are situations where one can be
creative or improvise solutions, but you should really try to learn
when that is appropriate before you do it. For instance, when using
PGP encryption you are often asked to verify the authenticity of any
new public key that you have just got. If you do not do this it is
possible that you are using a compromised key sent by an attacker
performing a [man-in-the-middle
attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack).
Usually the authentication works by presenting you with the key's so
called fingerprint, which is a unique identifier for that key that
cannot be faked. Verification should then be done by asking you friend
to send you the fingerprint through some safe channel, which could be
anything from telling it by telephone or VoiP (which is hard for an
attacker to manipulate on the fly) or even face-to-face (but hen you
can exchange the actual keys securely instead), and then making sure
that they are the same. Assuming the channel is safe the fingerprint
sent by your friend and the one you get from the key should be
identical, otherwise something is wrong.

The above authentication methods are of course not always possible,
but here is one of those places you can be creative. For example, you
could send the fingerprint hidden in an innocent looking image by some
means, although this is admittedly not bulletproof. You could make
this method a bit safer by first sending the picture to your unknowing
recipient and telling him or her how the fingerprint is hidden when
you know that it has been received. Additionally, these kinds of
tricky exchanges are always better to make over interactive
communication channels such as IRC or with instant messaging since
that will decrease the window of opportunity for any eavesdropper to
interfere. Email is not very suitable as delays are long which gives
the attacker ample time to act. An alternative authentication method
to fingerprints, used by OTR, is to simply ask both parties of a
shared secret that both should know. In this case, do not choose just
anything – if someone is watching you they probably know which high
school you went to, the size of your shoes and similar facts.

This is probably the place where we are expected to wish you good
luck, but we will not. Relying on luck simply is not good practice in
these situations. Stay cool and be smart! Thanks for you time!
