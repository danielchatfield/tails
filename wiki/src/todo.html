<div id="intro">

<p>Tails tasks are managed in Redmine at [[!tails_redmine "" desc="labs.riseup.net"</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to post your ideas for todo and wishlist items there.
If it seems more like a bug in the existing code, please [[report it as
a bug|support/found_a_problem]] instead.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The [[!tails_roadmap]] should help to understand our priorities.</li>
<li>Newcomers wanting to get involved should start with the
  [[how to contribute|contribute]] documentation.</li>
<li>Todo items that are fixed in the [[development branch|contribute/git]] and
  will therefore be solved in the next stable release appear on the
  [list of pending todo items](FIXME).</li>
<li>Todo items that have been solved in a shipped release, or otherwise closed,
  appear on the [list of resolved todo items](FIXME).</li>
</ul>
