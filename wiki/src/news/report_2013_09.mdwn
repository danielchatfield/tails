Infrastructure
==============

- You can download nightly builds of different branches of Tails on
  <http://nightly.tails.boum.org/>.
  - They have more unique names than previous builds.
  - They are signed with OpenPGP key 0xD83A438B2F916605
    ([[!tails_ticket 6193]]).
- We have started looking what UEFI hardware we need to do research
  and tests in this area. We would not mind a 13-inch 2011 MacBook Pro
  (MacBookPro8,1) or similar. We would not refuse a recent netbook
  that boots off UEFI, either.

On-going discussions

  desktop](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003680.html)

  volume](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003540.html)

Funding
=======

- We finally signed our short-term contract with sponsor Bravo. That
  will keep us very busy until the end of the year, and will address
  some of the stumbling blocks on the road towards Tails 1.0!

- We paid the first bounty of our bounty program. This one automated the
  migration of our ikiwiki tickets to
  [Redmine](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=108).
