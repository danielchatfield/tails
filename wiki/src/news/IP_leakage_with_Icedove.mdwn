As detailed on the related [[security
announce|security/IP_address_leak_with_Icedove]] page, the real IP address
being used,
and thus, in some cases, the amnesia user's true location, is
disclosed when using Icedove (Thunderbird) to send e-mail.

This has been fixed in [[amnesia 0.4.1|news/version_0.4.1]].
