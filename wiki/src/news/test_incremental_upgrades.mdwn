# How to test incremental upgrades?

These steps allow you to incrementally upgrade from Tails 0.22~rc1 to
Tails 0.22~rc2.

1. **Keep in mind that this is the first broad call for testing of
   Tails incremental upgrades**. Also, **Tails 0.22~rc2 is a test
   release**. Both might have undiscovered issues.

1. Install [[Tails 0.22~rc1|news/test_0.22-rc1]] with <span
   class="application">Tails Installer</span> onto a USB stick or
   SD card.

1. Start Tails 0.22~rc1 and [[set an administration
   password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]].

1. Run this command in a <span class="application">Root
   Terminal</span> to correct the firewall:

       sed -i -e \
          's/tails-iuk-get-target-file/(tails-iuk-get-target-file tails-upgrade-frontend)/' \
          /etc/ferm/ferm.conf && \
       /usr/sbin/ferm /etc/ferm/ferm.conf

1. Run this command in a <span class="application">Root
   Terminal</span> to select the *alpha* upgrade channel:

       echo TAILS_CHANNEL=\"alpha\" >> /etc/os-release

1. Choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">Applications</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guisubmenu">Tails</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">Tails Upgrader</span>
   </span>
   to start <span class="application">Tails Upgrader</span>.

1. Accept <span class="application">Tails Upgrader</span>'s proposal
   to upgrade to Tails 0.22~rc2.

1. Wait while the upgrade is downloaded and applied.

1. Restart the system when advised to do so.

1. Once the system is restarted, choose
   <span class="menuchoice">
     <span class="guimenu">System</span>&nbsp;▸
     <span class="guimenuitem">About Tails</span>
   </span>
   to confirm that the running system is Tails 0.22~rc2.
