Releases
========

Tails 0.17.2 [[was released|news/version_0.17.2]] on April 9th.

Metrics
=======

  - 121Â 183 connections of Tails to the Tor network. This makes a boot
    every 21 seconds on average (this is an approximation from the
    requests made to the security announcements feed when Tails is
    connected to Tor).

  - 71 bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

  - 984 comments were posted on the forum, with 76 signed by Tails.
    This means there has been much more activity on the forum, and that
    we are having a hard time coping with it, but also that anonymous
    contributors are providing more and more good answers without our
    help.

Code
====

- We had a highly successful ["low-hanging fruits"
  week](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-April/002834.html):
  at least 16 tickets were touched, and at least five persons attended
  one session or more.

- The persistence feature to [[todo/remember_installed_packages]]
  ([[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/remember_installed_packages desc="has
  matured a lot"]]) and should be ready for Tails 0.18.

- Support for Obfs3 bridges ([[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/obfs3
  desc="has been added"]]).

- Torbutton 1.5.x [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/torbutton-1.5.x
  desc="can now be included"]] in Tails. We also reorganized and cleaned
  our iceweasel prefs to look a bit more like the ones from TBB.

- GNOME accessibility themes [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/gnome-accessibility-themes desc="were installed"]] to provide
  high contrast and large print themes.

- The "About GNOME" menu entry [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/about_tails desc="has been customized"]] to provide
  information about the running version of Tails.

- A [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/set-wireless-devices-state
  desc="branch is ready"]] to disable wireless devices other than
  Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, WWAN, and WiMAX by default.

- Some initial work [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/dont_autostart_iceweasel desc="was done"]] to not start the
  browser automatically anymore.

- The audio preview when having the mouse pointer on an audio file in
  Nautilus [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/disable_audio_preview
  desc="has been disabled"]].

- The support for [[todo/non-obfsproxy_proxy]] [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  bugfix/non-obfsproxy_proxy desc="has been fixed"]].

- IPv6 is [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/enable-IPv6 desc="not disabled
  anymore"]]. It turns out that the IPv6 leaks we wanted to fix actually
  don't exist.

- GNOME screenshot [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/gnome-screenshot
  desc="has been installed"]].
