"USB drive must be dedicated to Tails; a bit of extra space is reserved so "
"that future Tails releases will fit when upgrading, and the rest can be used "
"for persistence (see below) or manually formatted if the user so wishes. See "

"    It proved to be quite unreliable, being sometimes down for days.\n"
"  - Do not display storage volumes on Desktop. This workarounds\n"
"    a usability issue when persistence is enabled, and paves the way\n"
"    towards GNOME3's empty Desktop.\n"
"  - Don't build hybrid ISO images anymore. They boot less reliably on\n"
"    a variety of hardware, and are made less useful by us shipping\n"
"    a USB installer from now on.\n"
