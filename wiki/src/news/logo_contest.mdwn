[[!meta title="Tails launches a logo contest"]]
[[!tag announce]]

On the 29th of April, we will release Tails 1.0. This will be an important
symbolic milestone about 5 years after our [[first public
releases|news/version_0.2]].

We want to have a proper logo by then to give Tails the visual impact it
deserves. The [image](https://tails.boum.org/lib/tails-logo-round.png) and
banner we used so far don't really do the job anymore...

So we're starting a contest for designers to create a logo for Tails. We already
brainstormed on the idea and received some great proposals [[!tails_ticket 5797
desc="in the past"]], but we had a hard time making our mind collectively on a
single proposal and wanted to give more people a chance.

Requirements
============

  - Free licence, compatible with GPL3+.
  - An image with an approximate 1:1 ratio, like the [onion
    log](https://media.torproject.org/image/www-images/onion.jpg).
  - Plus the same image along with the "Tails" word either:
    - merged with the image as in the [Tor
      log](https://media.torproject.org/image/www-images/tor-logo.jpg)
    - on the side of the image
  - The "Tails" name must have an uppercase "T" only, and lowercase "ails".
  - The image should transmit the idea behind Tails: secrecy, privacy,
    anonymity, mystery, simplicity (Tails is ready-to-use).
  - The logo has to be a bit serious, but not sad.
  - Until now we reuse the colors from Tor (green and purple), but this can be
    changed.
  - We'd rather not reuse the Tor or Debian logo, but evoking it it ok (use Tor
    colors, or evoking the Debian swirl).
  - The image should be suited to make nice stickers, and t-shirts, that people
    want to have on their computers or themselves.

Complementary materials
=======================

As the logo will be used in quite different places, we encourage you to submit
complementary materials. Those are not strict requirements but would help us
evaluate your proposal better. And we will need them anyway before being able to
make the logo public.

  - A banner for the website. The current one is 986x60px, but the new one could
    be higher, maybe up to 150px.
  - A [slash screen for
    boot](http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/plain/data/splash.png). Must be
    640x480px with a black background. It has to be distinguishable by the user
    as Tails but discrete enough not to attract to much attention from other
    people around.
  - A color palette for the website, if it needs to be adapted to the logo.
  - Fonts to be used to create material matching the logo.
  - A [CSS patch](http://git.tails.boum.org/tails/tree/wiki/src/local.css) for
    colors and fonts on the website, if you are into CSS.
  - A greyscale version of the logo.

Calendar
========

  - **31th of March**: Deadline for proposals to be submitted on
    tails-dev@boum.org.
  - **9th of April**: The winner is announced.
  - **15 of April**: All the complementary materials have to be ready so we have
    time to include them in Tails 1.0. The designer of the winning logo is
    really encourage to do this work, before or after the deadline for initial
    proposal.
