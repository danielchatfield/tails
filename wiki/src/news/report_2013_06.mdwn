Releases
========

Tails 0.19 [[was released|news/version_0.19]] on June 26.

Metrics
=======

- 140Â 517 connections of Tails to the Tor network. This makes a boot
  every 18.5 seconds on average (this is an approximation from the
  requests made to the security announcements feed when Tails is
  connected to Tor).

- 66 non-empty bug reports were received through WhisperBack.

- 110 comments were posted on the forum, with 32 signed by Tails,
  before we closed it.

Code
====

- Tails was [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/linux-3.9 desc="upgraded"]]
  to Linux 3.9.

- The [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/set-wireless-devices-state]]
  branch was merged, eventually.

- We tried to get in touch with the WiNoN developers. No reply so far.

- Many branches were merged just in time for the 0.19 freeze.

- Two [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/no_passwordless_sudo
  desc="serious"]] [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  bugfix/buggy_aufs_vs_unsafe-browser_workaround desc="bugs"]] were
  discovered while testing 0.19~rc1, and fixed for 0.19 final.
  This reinforces our conviction that we should run our test suite
  automatically as soon as possible.

- Some solutions to [[get rid of the JRuby
  mess|todo/test_suite:_getting_rid_of_the_jruby_mess]] were
  experimented with.

- Access restriction to ptrace was [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/restrict-access-to-ptrace desc="updated for the upcoming
  Debian kernel"]].

- The Iceweasel warning when leaving HTTPS [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  bugfix/dont-warn-when-leaving-https desc="was disabled"]]. Thanks to
  winterfairy for the initial patch.

- The [[wrong search
  engine|todo/fix_localized_iceweasel_search_engine]] bug
  [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/localized-iceweasel-search-engine
  desc="was fixed"]].

- Git over HTTPS [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/git-https desc="was
  fixed"]].

- All Pidgin protocols but IRC and Jabber/XMPP [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/less-pidgin-code desc="were disabled"]].

- The WhisperBack help [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/update_whisperback_help desc="was partly updated"]].

- Information about Alsa [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/alsa-info-in-bug-reports desc="was added"]] to
  WhisperBack reports.

- The "remember additional packages" feature was
  [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/new_persistence_location
  desc="adapted"]] to work with newer live-boot.

Documentation and Website
=========================

- We [[closed the forum|forum]].

- We decided not to follow Tor to StackExchange yet. We need more time
  to decide what we will do, now that our previously preferred option
  was discarded.

- The release process was automated a bit. So was our custom Iceweasel
  package release process.

Localization and Internationalization
=====================================

- Our POT files were [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/merge-pot-files
  desc="merged"]] first, and then we [[!tails_gitweb_branch
  feature/intltoolize desc="intltoolize'd" our translation system.
  This should help pushing these strings to Transifex.
