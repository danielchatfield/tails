Releases
========

Tails 0.16 [[was released on January 11th|news/version_0.16]].

The Tails 0.17 release is scheduled for late February. Back on tracks
with the [[6-weeks release cycle|contribute/release_schedule]] we
wanted to try, finally!

People
======

Tails has been started and successfully connected to the Tor network
around 100Â 865 times in January. That makes a boot every 27 seconds on
average. (This number is an approximation from the requests made for
the security announcements feed. The later is retrieved by Tails after
being connected to Tor to eventually encourage users to update.)

We received 24 reports through WhisperBack.

The forum activity has been a bit lower, but still quite high:
874 messages, 140 signed by Tails.

Code
====

Our "Iceweasel with Torbrowser patches" packages have been [[rebased
on Iceweasel 17|todo/torbrowser_17]]. Many thanks to Mike Perry for
his support along the way!

Alessandro Grassi is still leading work on [[integrating
Minitube|todo/minitube]] in Tails. The Debian part was [fixed for
Wheezy](http://bugs.debian.org/699603). Jacob Appelbaum [has
volunteered](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8064) to
audit Minitube anonymity for us (thanks a bunch!), and Alessandro has
[started this
audit](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002537.html).

The persistence device search is now [[!tails_gitweb_branch
feature/live-persist_guess_removable desc="similar to the live-boot
one"]].

Some preliminary work was done to [[!tails_gitweb_branch
feature/faster_sdmem_on_shutdown desc="make memory wipe faster"]]
on shutdown.

A branch [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/do_not_allow_listing_fonts
desc="fixed a configuration bug"]] that disabled the Torbrowser
protection against listing available fonts. This was no regression.

The Seahorse GnuPG agent was [[!tails_gitweb_branch
feature/regular-gnupg-agent desc="replaced with the regular
gnupg-agent"]], to fix a long standing bug with Claws Mail. This adds
support for OpenPGP smartcards as a bonus.

Our Icedove patches were rebased against the 10.x series, and test
packages [were
uploaded](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002522.html).
We're still not there yet but this, added to TorBirdy soon arriving
into Debian, is a significant step towards [[replacing Claws Mail with
Icedove|todo/Return of Icedove?]].

It's now possible to build a Tails image based on Debian Wheezy.
There's still [[quite|todo/Wheezy]] [[some work|tails-greeter vs. Wheezy]].

A branch that [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/i2p_hidden_mode
desc"switches I2P to hidden mode"]] is ready.

The buggy default Iceweasel spelling language [[!tails_gitweb_branch
bugfix/fix_default_iceweasel_spelling_language desc="was fixed"]].

The next Tails ISO should be [[!tails_gitweb_branch
bugfix/remove_apt_local_cache desc="a bit smaller"]]... but don't get
used to it.

Work was done to [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/recent-microcode
desc="install recent Intel and AMD microcode"]].

Quite some time was spent to help make Debian Wheezy an awesome
platform to use and built Tails upon.

Documentation and website
=========================

Some localization tricks [[were published|contribute/l10n_tricks]].

Tails accessibility features [[were
documented|doc/first_steps/accessibility]].

It [[has been explained|doc/about/fingerprint]] what one may expect
from the Tails fingerprint.

A script to check our PO files quality [[was writen|contribute/l10n_tricks/check_po.sh]].

On-going discussions
====================

We are discussing [how the browser homepage should be
like](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002502.html).

It's likely that some anonymity-oriented distributions share a common
username and hostname in the future:
<https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002457.html>.

We are discussing with upstream how to adapt TorBirdy for Tails'
needs:
<https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002523.html>.

We're not sure whether it's worth keeping the Tails section in the
Applications menu:
<https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002511.html>.

It's still not totally clear what should be the defaults regarding MAC
address changing:
<https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002495.html>.

Funding
=======

We have filed a grant application with Sponsor Bravo.

Our upcoming bounties program is being organized.
