"2013-10-15: [CRYPTO-GRAM, October 15, "
"2013](http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-1310.html) — Bruce Schneier: \"One "
"thing I didn't do, although it's worth considering, is use a stateless "
"operating system like Tails. You can configure Tails with a persistent "
"volume to save your data, but no operating system changes are ever "
"saved. Booting Tails from a read-only DVD -- you can keep your data on an "
"encrypted USB stick -- is even more secure. Of course, this is not "
"foolproof, but it greatly reduces the potential avenues for attack.\""
