[[!meta title="Tails user support mailing list"]]

After we closed off our forum in June, the Tails community was left
without a public user support channel apart from IRC.

Introducing tails-support@boum.org
==================================

To compensate this loss, we decided to create a new public mailing list
for user support.

[[!inline pages="support/tails-support" raw="yes"]]

Some reasons behind this decision
=================================

Since 2012, we worked on replacing the old forum with a question and
answer application. We hoped we could have a shared application with The
Tor Project that was heading in the same direction. For many reasons
this did not happen.

To solve this we decided to:

- Setup a support mailing list as a new public channel for user support
  with the help of the Tails community.
- Gather frequently asked questions from the forum and the list on our
  website.
- On the long-run, have Askbot into Debian and improve it with the
  features we need.
