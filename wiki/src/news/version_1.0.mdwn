# Introduction

We are especially proud to present you Tails 1.0!

Version 1.0 is often an [[!wikipedia Version_number#Version_1.0_as_a_milestone
desc="important milestone"]] that denotes the maturity of a free software
project.

[[!wikipedia Version_number#Version_1.0_as_a_milestone desc="Version 1.0"]] is
usually an important milestone that denotes the maturity of a free software
project. The first public version of what would become Tails was released on
June 23 2009, it was called [[Amnesia 2.0|version_0.2]]. That was almost five
years ago. Tails 1.0 marks the 36st stable release since then.

## Achievements

We have been working since then to offer in Tails many features that we think
are essentials to build a quality tool both in terms of security and usability:

  - [[USB installer|doc/first_steps/installation]]
  - [[automatic upgrades|doc/first_steps/upgrade]]
  - [[persistence|doc/first_steps/persistence]]
  - [[support for Tor bridges|doc/first_steps/startup_options/bridge_mode]] and
    other [[special Tor
    configuration|doc/first_steps/startup_options/network_configuration]]
  - [[MAC address spoofing|doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing]]
  - [[extensive and translated documentation|doc]]
  - and [[many more...|doc/about/features]]

But this has been a continuous work over the past years, and you will see that
1.0 itself does not imply a lot of effective changes for the user. Still to mark
the occasion, we integrated our [[new logo|news/and_the_winner_is]] on the
website and the boot menu.

## Thank you

The maturity of Tails is also reflected in:

  - Its wide adoption. In the last 18 months, the approximate of number of Tails
    users has been multiplied by 4.
  - All the good things said about Tails by people and organisations that we
    appreciate such as [Freedom of the Press
    Foundation](https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/blog/2014/04/help-support-little-known-privacy-tool-has-been-critical-journalists-reporting-nsa),
    [Bruce
    Schneier](http://boingboing.net/2013/12/15/bruce-schneier-and-eben-moglen-2.html),
    [Reporters Without
    Borders](https://www.wefightcensorship.org/article/tails-amnesic-incognito-live-systemhtml.html),
    and [[many more...|press]]

## Future

Version 1.0 does not mean that we will stop adding new features and improving
Tails. Briefly, here are our plans for the future:

- [Tails 1.1](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap#Tails_1.1),
  due in June 2014, will be based on Debian 7 (Wheezy) and will bring many new
  versions of the software included in Tails.

- [Tails 2.0](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap#Tails_2.0)
  will focus on sustainability and maintainability. Most of that work aims at
  reducing the workload of creating new versions of Tails through infrastructure
  improvements and automated testing. Our objective is to be able to release
  same-day security updates.

- [Tails 3.0](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap#Tails_3.0)
  will focus on changes in the internals of Tails to make it more secure. That
  includes sandboxing critical applications and software hardening.

And of course, new contributors with all kinds of skills are always welcome.
There is surely [[something **you** can do|contribute]] to make Tails better.
