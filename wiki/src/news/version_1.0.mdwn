# Introduction

The first Tails release happened on May 1, 2010, almost four years ago
to the day. Tails 1.0 marks the 31st stable release since then, which
means that there has been a stable release almost every six weeks on
average. During this time we have seen many [[similar privacy-oriented
Live systems|about#index7h1]] rise and fall while Tails has persisted
and grown into a mature project.

The 1.0 release does not really mean anything more than Tails reaching
maturity, and certainly does not mean that Tails is "complete" and going
into maintenance mode. There are many [features and other developments
planned](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap) for the
future, both near and far, and we are still looking for [[your
help|contribute]] finishing them.
