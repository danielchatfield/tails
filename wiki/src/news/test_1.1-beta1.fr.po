"* Major new features\n"
"  - Replace the Windows XP camouflage with an experimental Windows 8\n"
"    camouflage. It can be enabled in Tails Greeter just like before.\n"
"  - UEFI boot support. This allows you to boot Tails from USB sticks\n"
"    on recent hardware, and especially on Mac. It enables you to use\n"
"    great features such as [[doc/first_steps/persistence]] and\n"
"    [[doc/first_steps/automatic upgrades]]. Our previous\n"
"    [[Call for testing: UEFI|news/test_UEFI]] may be a helpful read\n"
"    until we have documented this properly, and if you experience\n"
"    problems you may want to have a look at the\n"
"    [[known issues for UEFI support|blueprint/UEFI/syslinux#known_issues]].\n"
"  - Install Linux 3.14 from Debian unstable for improved hardware support.\n"
"  - Bring back VirtualBox guest modules, installed from Wheezy\n"
"    backports. This enables, for instance, more screen resolutions\n"
"    (including a dynamic one based on the window size on the host) and\n"
"    host-guest file and clipboard sharing. Unfortunately full\n"
"    functionality is only available when using the 32-bit kernel.\n"

"* Minor improvements\n"
"  - Install seahorse-nautilus, replacing seahorse-plugins (Closes\n"
"    [[!tails_ticket 5516]]).\n"
"  - Install hledger (custom backport, for now): our accountant needs this.\n"
"  - Install stable Scribus instead of scribus-ng.\n"
"  - Install the printer driver for Epson Inkjet that use ESC/P-R.\n"
"  - Install the BookletImposer PDF imposition toolkit. It's tiny,\n"
"    and really helpful e.g. when producing booklets.\n"
"  - Install gtkhash and nautilus-gtkhash (Closes [[!tails_ticket 6763]]).\n"
"  - Don't install Gobby 0.4 anymore. Gobby 0.5 has been available in\n"
"    Debian since Squeeze, now is a good time to drop the obsolete\n"
"    0.4 implementation.\n"
"  - Make Tails Greeter's help window resolution-aware. Previously it\n"
"    used a static 800x600 which was problematic on lower resolutions,\n"
"    and sub-optimal on higher resolutions. Now it adapts itself\n"
"    according to the screen resolution.\n"
"  - Whisperback now sanitizes attached logs better with respect to DMI\n"
"    data, IPv6 addresses, and serial numbers (Closes\n"
"    [[!tails_ticket 6797]], [[!tails_ticket 6798]],\n"
"    [[!tails_ticket 6804]]).\n"
"  - Integrate the new logo in Tails Installer (Closes\n"
"    [[!tails_ticket 7095]])\n"
