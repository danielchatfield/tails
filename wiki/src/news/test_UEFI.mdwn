[[!meta title="Call for testing: UEFI"]]

[[!meta date="2014-04-15 16:00:00"]]

If you want to help Tails, UEFI support is ready for testing!

UEFI support allows you to start Tails using a USB stick on recent
hardware, and especially on Mac. It enables you to use great
features such as [[doc/first_steps/persistence]] and [[automatic
upgrades|doc/first_steps/upgrade]].

Please try it and see if it works for you:

 * If you have previously had problems starting Tails on your
   hardware, using a USB stick created with <span
   class="application">Tails Installer</span>: a new Tails with UEFI
   support may fix these problems.

 * If you are used to start Tails using a USB stick created with <span
   class="application">Tails Installer</span>: make sure that UEFI support
   does not break things for you.

# How to try UEFI support?

These instructions allow you to try an **experimental version of
Tails** with UEFI support. Use it only for testing.

To follow these instructions, you will need two boot devices
compatible with Tails: either a DVD and a USB sticks, or two
USB sticks.

Follow these steps exactly: for example, do not try to upgrade an existing Tails
USB stick.

1. Download the latest [test ISO](http://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_feature-uefi/).

1. Use any officially supported way to
   [[install|doc/first_steps/installation]] the experimental ISO image
   to first device, that we will call *Alpha*, that can be a DVD or a USB stick. At this point,
   device *Alpha* does not support UEFI.

1. Start Tails from device *Alpha* in legacy mode.

1. Take detailed notes about how this boot went.

1. *Clone & Install* device *Alpha* onto a USB stick [[with <span
   class="application">Tails
   Installer</span>|doc/first_steps/installation]]. From now on, we
   will call this second device *Beta*, and it supports UEFI.

1. Start Tails from the USB stick *Beta* in legacy mode.

1. Take detailed notes about how this boot went. If it failed, don't
   despair: maybe the following test will succeed!

1. Start Tails from the USB stick *Beta* in UEFI mode:
   * On a Mac: plug the USB stick, press the power button, immediately
     press the `alt` key until a boot menu appears, and then choose
     the entry that reads *Boot EFI* and looks like a USB stick.
   * On a PC: look first into the boot menu; if nothing reads *EFI* in
     there, look in the BIOS settings, and try any of the following
     options if available: `Disable Legacy mode`, `Disable CSM boot`,
     and `Enable UEFI`.

1. Take detailed notes about how this boot went.

1. Report your results to us, as documented below.

Reporting success and failure
=============================

We are interested both in your success and failure reports.

To make such reports useful, we need quite a bit of information: the
exact information we need depends on whether you are reporting success
or failure.

## Reporting success

From Tails started in UEFI mode, please [[send us
a report|doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] with <span
class="application">WhisperBack</span>. Include your testing notes,
and the answer to the following questions:

1. What is the filename of the ISO you have been testing?
1. How exactly did you prepare the boot device?
1. What exact steps did you follow to start Tails from this device?

## Reporting failure

If you find a computer that cannot start with an experimental version
of Tails that supports UEFI, please first check if the problem you are
experiencing is [[already known|test_UEFI#known_issues]]. If it is,
then you do not need to send us a report. Else, read on.

Your report must include the answer to the following questions:

1. What is the filename of the ISO you have been testing?
1. How exactly did you prepare the boot device?
1. What exact steps did you follow to start Tails from this device?
1. What are the brand and model of the computer your have been
   testing on?
1. What are the type, brand, and model of the boot device?
1. What exactly happens when you tried to start Tails from
   this device?

Please also consider trying what follows, and including the results
in your report:

1. Try to reproduce the problem with the latest official version of
   Tails, installed in the same way, on the same hardware.
1. Try to reproduce the problem with an [experimental ISO built from
   the devel
   branch](http://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_devel/),
   installed in the same way, on the same hardware.

In any case, please email your report to <intrigeri@boum.org>. You may
encrypt it with OpenPGP to:

	pub   4096R/0xBACE15D2A57498FF 2009-09-13 [expires: 2014-09-12]
