"* Tor\n"
"  - Upgrade to 0.2.2.34. This fixes CVE-2011-2768 and CVE-2011-2769\n"
"    which prompted for manual updates for users of Tails 0.8.1.\n"
"  - Suppress Tor's warning about applications doing their own DNS\n"
"    lookups. Some users have reported concerns about these warnings,\n"
"    but it should be noted that they are completely harmless inside\n"
"    Tails as its system DNS resolver is Torified.\n"

"* Iceweasel\n"
"  - Upgrade to 3.5.16-11 ((fixes CVE-2011-3647, CVE-2011-3648,\n"
"    CVE-2011-3650).\n"
"  - Torbutton: upgrade to 1.4.4.1-1, including support for the\n"
"    in-browser \"New identity\" feature.\n"
"  - FireGPG: upgrade to 0.8-1+tails2. Users are notified that the\n"
"    FireGPG Text Editor is the only safe place for performing\n"
"    cryptographic operations, and these operations has been disabled\n"
"    in other places. Performing them outside of the editor opens up\n"
"    several severe attacks through JavaScript (e.g. leaking plaintext\n"
"    when decrypting, signing messages written by the attacker).\n"
"  - Replace CS Lite with Cookie Monster for cookie management. Cookie\n"
"    Monster has an arguably nicer interface, is being actively\n"
"    maintained and is packaged in Debian.\n"

"* Software\n"
"  - Install [MAT](https://mat.boum.org/), the Metadata Anonymisation\n"
"    Toolkit. Its goal is to remove file metadata which otherwise\n"
"    could leak information about you in the documents and media files\n"
"    you publish. This is the result of a Tails developer's suggestion\n"
"    for GSoC 2011, although it ended up being mentored by The Tor\n"
"    Project.\n"
"  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.5~rc1. Users are guided how to send their\n"
"    bug reports through alternative channels upon errors sending\n"
"    them. This will make bug reporting easier when there's no network\n"
"    connection available.\n"
"  - Upgrade TrueCrypt to 7.1.\n"

"* Miscellaneous\n"
"  - The date and time setting system was completely reworked. This\n"
"    should prevent time syncing issues that may prevent Tor from\n"
"    working properly, which some users have reported. The new system\n"
"    will not leave a fingerprintable network signature, like the old\n"
"    system did. Previously that signature could be used to identify\n"
"    who is using Tails (but *not* deanonymize them).\n"
"  - Erase memory at shutdown: run many instances of the memory\n"
"    wiper. Due to architectural limitations of i386 a process cannot\n"
"    access all memory at the same time, and hence a single memory wipe\n"
"    instance cannot clear all memory.\n"
"  - Saner keyboard layouts for Arabic and Russian.\n"
"  - Use Plymouth text-only splash screen at boot time.\n"
