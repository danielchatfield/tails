Feature: Root access control enforcement
  As a Tails user
  when I set an administration password in Tails Greeter
  I can use the password for attaining administrative privileges.
  But when I do not set an administration password
  I should not be able to attain administration privileges at all.

  Background:
    Given a computer
    And the network is unplugged
    And I start the computer
    And the computer boots Tails
    And I save the state so the background can be restored next scenario

  Scenario: If an administrative password is set in Tails Greeter the live user should be able to run arbitrary commands with administrative privileges.
    Given I enable more Tails Greeter options
    And I set sudo password "asdf"
    And I log in to a new session
    And Tails Greeter has dealt with the sudo password
    Then I should be able to run administration commands as the live user

  Scenario: If no administrative password is set in Tails Greeter the live user should not be able to run arbitrary commands administrative privileges.
    Given I log in to a new session
    And Tails Greeter has dealt with the sudo password
    Then I should not be able to run administration commands as the live user

  Scenario: If an administrative password is set in Tails Greeter the live user should be able to get administrative privileges through PolicyKit

    And Tails Greeter has dealt with the sudo password
    And GNOME has started
    Then I should be able to run synaptic
