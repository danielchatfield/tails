# Rationale: Tor needs a somewhat accurate clock to work, and for that
# HTP is currently the only practically usable solution when one wants
# to authenticate the servers providing the time. We then need to get
# the IPs of a bunch of HTTPS servers.

# However, since all DNS lookups are normally made through the Tor
# network, which we are not connected to at this point, we use the
# local DNS servers obtained through DHCP, if possible, or the OpenDNS
# ones otherwise.

# To limit fingerprinting possibilities, we do not want to send HTTP
# requests aimed at an IP-based virtualhost such as https://IP/, but
# rather to the usual hostname (e.g. https://www.eff.org/) as any
# "normal" user would do. Once we have got the HTTPS servers IPs, we
# write these to /etc/hosts so the system resolver knows about them.
# htpdate is then run, and we eventually remove the added entries from
# /etc/hosts.

# Note that all network operations (host, htpdate) are done with the
# htp user, who has an exception in the firewall configuration
# granting it direct access to the needed network ports.

# That's why we tell the htpdate script to drops priviledges and run
# as the htp user all operations but the actual setting of time, which
# has to be done as root.


### Init variables

### Exit conditions

# Run only when the interface is not "lo":
if [ "$1" = "lo" ]; then
	exit 0
fi

# Run whenever an interface gets "up", not otherwise:
if [ "$2" != "up" ]; then
	exit 0
fi

# Do not run if we already successed:
if [ -e "$SUCCESS_FILE" ]; then
	exit 0

### Delete previous state file
rm -f "$DONE_FILE"


### Create log file

# The htp user needs to write to this file.
# The $LIVE_USERNAME user needs to read this file.
touch "$LOG"
chown htp:nogroup "$LOG"
chmod 644 "$LOG"


### Run tails-htp-notify-user (the sooner, the better)

# Get LIVE_USERNAME
. /etc/live/config.d/username

export DISPLAY=':0.0'
export XAUTHORITY="$(echo /var/run/gdm3/auth-for-$LIVE_USERNAME-*/database)"
