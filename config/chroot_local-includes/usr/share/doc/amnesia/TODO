* use ikiwiki's mirrorlist plugin to add links to the online wiki from
  the static one included in the images; **but** it generates wrong
  links when the `usedirs` settings are not the same on the mirror as
  on the static copy; we need `usedirs` enabled on the online wiki for
  language negotiation to work, and `usedirs` disabled on the static
  wiki because no web server is there to choose the right index pages.
  A patch allowing finer-grained mirrorlist configuration has been
  [proposed](http://ikiwiki.info/todo/mirrorlist_with_per-mirror_usedirs_settings/)
  to ikiwiki's upstream in order to fix this.
