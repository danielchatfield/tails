Description: a Tor-ified, amnesic Live System
 amnesia is a Live System aimed at preserving its users' privacy:
   - any outgoing connection to the Internet is forced to go through
     the Tor network
   - no trace is left on local storage devices unless explicitely asked
 .
 This package provides the source and tools that are necessary to build
 such Live System using Debian Live.
